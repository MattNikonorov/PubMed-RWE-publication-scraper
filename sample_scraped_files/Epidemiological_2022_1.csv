As Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a common condition at old age, an interplay between genetic factors affecting AD and longevity is expected. We explored this interplay by studying the prevalence of AD-associated single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in cognitively healthy centenarians, and replicated findings in a parental-longevity GWAS. We found that 28/38 SNPs that increased AD-risk also associated with lower odds of longevity. For each SNP, we express the imbalance between AD- and longevity-risk as an effect-size distribution. Based on these distributions, we grouped the SNPs in three groups: 17 SNPs increased AD-risk more than they decreased longevity-risk, and were enriched for β-amyloid metabolism and immune signaling; 11 variants reported a larger longevity-effect compared to their AD-effect, were enriched for endocytosis/immune-signaling, and were previously associated with other age-related diseases. Unexpectedly, 10 variants associated with an increased risk of AD and higher odds of longevity. Altogether, we show that different AD-associated SNPs have different effects on longevity, including SNPs that may confer general neuro-protective functions against AD and other age-related diseases.""","""['Niccolò Tesi', 'Marc Hulsman', 'Sven J van der Lee', 'Iris E Jansen', 'Najada Stringa', 'Natasja M van Schoor', 'Philip Scheltens', 'Wiesje M van der Flier', 'Martijn Huisman', 'Marcel J T Reinders', 'Henne Holstege']""","""[' Section Genomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Aging, Department of Clinical Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ' Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ' Delft Bioinformatics Lab, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.', ' Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Data Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Genet""","""[""Immune response and endocytosis pathways are associated with the resilience against Alzheimer's disease."", ""Shared genetic etiology underlying Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes."", 'Genetic variation and human longevity.', ""Genome-wide significant, replicated and functional risk variants for Alzheimer's disease."", ""Are Alzheimer's and coronary artery diseases genetically related to longevity?"", 'Long-Lived Individuals Show a Lower Burden of Variants Predisposing to Age-Related Diseases and a Higher Polygenic Longevity Score.', 'Genetic trade-offs between complex diseases and longevity.']"""

Methods:   The target population of the study consisted of the health-care professionals working in the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire form consisted of 40 questions. The demographic information of the participants, the presence of contact with the COVID-19 patient, they used which personal protective equipment (PPE) and how often, the effect of the pandemic process on the lifestyle, the presence of visual defects, the effect of the pandemic process on water consumption, the presence of old or de novo headaches, the factors that may affect this headache, and the factors that reduce the pain were questioned in the survey.  Results:   A total of 177 health-care professionals participated in the study. About 93.8% of the participants use masks daily for more than 4 h. About 62.7% of the participants stated that their water consumption increased on the days when they used PPE. About 72.3% of the participants reported disruption in sleep patterns, 83.1% of them reported increase in their stress and anxiety. About 65.5% of the participants experienced headaches during the pandemic process. They reported that the most likely causes of headache were excessive sweating and difficulty in breathing due to the use of PPE.  Conclusion:   During the pandemic, a substantial portion of health-care professionals experiences headaches. Besides the physical difficulties caused by the use of PPE, the stress caused by the pandemic process should not be ignored.""","""['Gülçin Hacıbeyoğlu', 'Ayşe Seda Eren', 'Şule Arıcan', 'Resul Yılmaz', 'Ruhiye Reisli', 'Sema Tuncer Uzun']""","""[' Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.', ' Department of Algology, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Agri""","""['Headaches Associated With Personal Protective Equipment - A Cross-Sectional Study Among Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19.', 'Personal Protective Equipment and Headaches: Cross-Sectional Study Among Moroccan Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Headache of Wearing PPE; A Survey for Neurological Symptoms with PPE amongst Health Care Workers.', 'Problems Encountered by Nurses Due to the Use of Personal Protective Equipment During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Results of a Survey.', 'Headache Related to PPE Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Physical problems and fatigue level of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Personal protective equipment-associated headaches in health care workers during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Recent experiments in rodents revealed that Col17a1 has critical roles in stem cells of epidermal origin and in melanoma carcinogenesis. In the present study, it was investigated whether germline variants in COL17A1 are associated with skin cancer and other cancer types using indexed consecutive autopsy cases from the Japanese Geriatric Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (n=2,343; mean age, 80 years). The database included 12 patients with skin cancer. A total of 53 COL17A1 missense variants on an exome chip were analyzed. One variant, p.Ser1029Ala (rs118166857), which had a minor allele frequency of 1.0%, exhibited a nominal positive sign of association with skin cancer [Fisher's exact P=0.002, odds ratio (OR)=16.93, 95% CI: 4.44-64.64]. This variant was detected in 2/2 patients with mucosal malignant melanoma (mMM) and 1/3 patients with extramammary Paget's disease, and in none of the patients with non-melanoma cancer, e.g., squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma. Other cancer types were searched in the database and the p.Ser1029Ala variant was indicated to be nominally associated with breast cancer (P=0.006, OR=4.17, 95% CI: 1.72-10.11). In the two mMM cases, targeted exome sequencing of 55 cancer-predisposing genes (including tumor protein 53, BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes) detected no apparent pathogenic variants, but revealed variants of unknown significance in axin 2, DNA directed polymerase ζ catalytic subunit and contactin 6. Since COL17A1 provides a niche for melanocyte stem cells, it was hypothesized that the p.Ser1029Ala variant in the COL17A1 ectodomain may affect the microenvironment, e.g., the cell competition. This is a working hypothesis generated from human autopsy cases and warrants further epidemiological and molecular biological validation.""","""['Daike Tong', 'Masashi Tanaka', 'Hidetaka Eguchi', 'Yasushi Okazaki', 'Masaaki Muramatsu', 'Tomio Arai']""","""[' Department of Molecular Epidemiology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', ' Department of Neurology, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.', ' Diagnostics and Therapeutics of Intractable Diseases, Intractable Disease Research Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.', ' Department of Pathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo 173-0015, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Feb""","""Mol Clin Oncol""","""['Whole Exome Sequencing and Segregation Analysis Confirms That a Mutation in COL17A1 Is the Cause of Epithelial Recurrent Erosion Dystrophy in a Large Dominant Pedigree Previously Mapped to Chromosome 10q23-q24.', 'In epithelial cancers, aberrant COL17A1 promoter methylation predicts its misexpression and increased invasion.', 'Mutations in collagen, type XVII, alpha 1 (COL17A1) cause epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED).', 'Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.', 'Collagen XVII Processing and Blistering Skin Diseases.']"""

Methods:   345 full-time undergraduate students from The University of Hong Kong were invited to complete a questionnaire to assess their alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, CAGE questionnaire), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and stress-coping methods (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory), as well as knowledge and perception of alcohol consumption on health. Multiple linear regression was used to determine significant variables associated with depressive symptoms. Multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the effect of such variables on depressive symptom caseness and AUDIT drinking risk groups.  Results:   43.2% of respondents were moderate- to high-risk drinkers, but only 23.2% were self-reported as moderate- to high-level drinkers. 57.9% of respondents had mild to severe depressive symptoms. Probable depression was more likely to occur in female students, those with higher general stress, those who do not use social support for stress-coping, and those who smoke. High-risk drinkers were more likely to occur in older students, smokers, those with higher household income, and those with higher general stress levels. Students with higher levels of depressive symptoms and higher risk of alcohol consumption were more likely to use avoidance for stress-coping. 89.5% of students considered alcohol consumption moderately to very harmful to health, but students demonstrated only moderate knowledge levels of alcohol consumption on health.  Conclusion:   Alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms are prevalent among university students in Hong Kong. The use of avoidance for stress-coping is common in those with higher levels of depressive symptoms and higher-risk drinkers. Students tend to avoid seeking help for depressive symptoms and potentially take up drinking as a coping strategy. Context-specific approaches should be used when providing counselling services for student wellbeing in university settings. Further education of university students on knowledge and perception of alcohol consumption on health should be provided.""","""['M S C Chow', 'S H L Poon', 'K L Lui', 'C C Y Chan', 'W W T Lam']""","""[' Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong.', ' School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""East Asian Arch Psychiatry""","""['Anxiety, depression and risk consumption of alcohol in a sample of university students.', 'Prevalence and associated factors of alcohol use patterns among university students in Uganda.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Alcohol use among entrants to a Hong Kong University.', 'Knowledge and Practice towards Alcohol Consumption in a Sample of University Students.', 'Validation of student academic advising and counseling evaluation tool among undergraduate nursing students.', 'Temporal associations between depressive features and self-stigma in people with substance use disorders related to heroin, amphetamine, and alcohol use: a cross-lagged analysis.']"""

Methods:   We enrolled 251 children and their caregivers in the orthopedic surgery clinic of a tertiary care children's hospital. Children 5 to 17 years old presenting within 10 days of injury for follow-up for a single-extremity, nonoperative long bone fracture(s) were eligible. The primary outcome was seeking unscheduled evaluation or advice for poorly controlled pain before the first routine follow-up appointment by telephone call, medical visit, or rescheduling to an earlier appointment. Factors associated with the outcome were assessed using bivariable analysis.  Results:   Overall, 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 4.1%-10.6%) of participants sought unscheduled evaluation or advice for poorly controlled pain. The 2 most common reasons were to obtain over-the-counter analgesic dosage information (64.7%) and a stronger analgesic (29.4%). These children were more likely to have a leg fracture, have an overriding or translated fracture, or require manual reduction under procedural sedation. These children had higher Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Behavior and Pain Interference scores and more anxious caregivers. One-third of caregivers expressed hesitancy or refusal to use opioids to treat severe pain, and 45.7% reported potential addiction or abuse as the rationale.  Conclusions:   A notable proportion of children seek assistance for poorly controlled fracture-related pain.

The radiation level in this area varies from < 1.0 to 45.0 mGy/year. This area serves as an ideal source for conducting large-scale epidemiological studies for assessing risk of low dose and low dose rate radiation exposure on human population. The areas with a dose level of ≤1.50 mGy/year are considered as normal level natural radiation areas (NLNRAs) and areas with > 1.50 mGy/year, as high level natural radiation areas (HLNRAs). HLNRAs were further stratified into three dose groups of 1.51-3.0 mGy/year, 3.01-6.00 mGy/year and > 6.0 mGy/year. The present study evaluates the effects of chronic low dose radiation (LDR) exposure on the birth prevalence of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD) among the live newborns monitored in hospital based prospective study from NLNRAs and HLNRAs of Kerala coast, India.  Methodology:   Consecutive newborns were monitored from two hospital units located in the study area for congenital malformations. Referred CHD cases among the newborns screened were confirmed by conducting investigations such as pulse oximetry, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram etc. RESULTS: Among the newborns screened, 289 CHDs were identified with a frequency of 1.49‰ among 193,634 livebirths, which constituted 6.03% of overall malformations and 16.29% of major malformations. Multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that the risk of CHD among the newborns of mothers from HLNRAs with a dose group of 1.51-3.0 mGy/year was significantly lower as compared to NLNRA (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.92), whereas it was similar in HLNRA dose groups of 3.01-6.00 mGy/year (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.31-1.00) and ≥ 6.0 mGy/year (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.50-1.85). The frequency of CHDs did not show any radiation dose related increasing trend. However, a significant (P = 0.005) reduction was observed in the birth prevalence of CHDs among the newborns from HLNRA (1.28‰) as compared to NLNRA (1.79‰).  Conclusion:   Chronic LDR exposure did not show any increased risk on the birth prevalence of CHDs from high-level natural radiation areas of Kerala coast, India. No linear increasing trend was observed with respect to different background dose groups. The frequency of CHD was observed to be 1.49 per 1000 livebirths, which was similar to the frequency of severe CHD rate reported elsewhere in India and was much less than the reported frequency of 9 per thousand.""","""['K R Sudheer', 'P K Mohammad Koya', 'Anu J Prakash', 'Ambily M Prakash', 'R Manoj Kumar', 'S Shyni', 'C K Jagadeesan', 'G Jaikrishan', 'Birajalaxmi Das']""","""[' Low Level Radiation Research Laboratory, Low Level Radiation Research Section (LLRRS), Radiation Biology & Health Sciences Division (RB&HSD), Bio-Science Group (BSG), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Beach Road, Kollam, Kerala, 691 001, India.', ' Department of Paediatrics, Victoria Hospital, Kollam, 691 001, India.', ' Department of Gynaecology, Victoria Hospital, Kollam, 691 001, India.', ' Department of Paediatrics, Taluk Head Quarters Hospital, Karunagapally, 690 544, India.', ' Department of Gynaecology, Taluk Head Quarters Hospital, Karunagapally, 690 544, India.', ' Directorate of Health Services, Government of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 011, India.', ' Low Level Radiation Research Section (LLRRS), Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Radiation Biology & Health Sciences Division (RB&HSD), Bio-Science Group (BSG), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, 400 085, India. biraj@barc.gov.in.', ' Homi Bhabha National Institute, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, 400 094, India. biraj@barc.gov.in.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Genes Environ""","""['Evaluation of natural chronic low dose radiation exposure on telomere length and transcriptional response of shelterin complex in individuals residing in Kerala coast, India.', 'No evidence of telomere length attrition in newborns from high level natural background radiation areas in Kerala coast, south west India.', 'Evaluation of the influence of chronic low-dose radiation on DNA repair gene polymorphisms XRCC1, XRCC3, PRKDC (XRCC7), LIG1, NEIL1 in individuals from normal and high level natural radiation areas of Kerala Coast.', 'Study of stillbirth and major congenital anomaly among newborns in the high-level natural radiation areas of Kerala, India.', 'Suicidal Ideation.']"""

Methods:   The levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgM and IgG were measured by the immuno-colloidal gold method. A fusion fragment of nucleocapsid and spike protein was detected by a qualitative test kit with sensitivity (89%) and specificity (98%).  Results:   The seroprevalence rate for IgM and IgG in all outpatients was 2.81% and 7.51%, respectively. The sex-related prevalence rate of IgG was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in women than men. The highest positive rate of IgM was observed in individuals < 20 years of age (3.57%), while the highest seroprevalence for IgG was observed in persons > 60 years of age (8.61%). Positive rates of IgM and IgG in the convalescent patients were 31.82% and 77.27%, respectively, which was significantly higher than individuals with suspected syndromes or individuals without any clinical signs (P < 0.01). Seroprevalence for IgG in medical staff was markedly higher than those in residents. No significant difference of seroprevalence was found among patients with different comorbidities (P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   The low positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and nucleic acid (NA) test indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is subsiding after 3 months, and the possibility of reintroduction of the virus from an unidentified natural reservoir is low.

Methods:   We systematically searched CPGs published from 2008 to 2019. The methodological quality of the included CPGs was assessed using the AGREE II instrument. We extracted and compared recommendations for prophylactic and empirical treatment strategies.  Results:   Fourteen CPGs with a median overall score of 56.3% were included. The highest domain score was Clarity of Presentation (domain 4, 85.4%), and the lowest was for Stakeholder Involvement (domain 2, 31.3%). Three CPGs had an overall score above 80%, and 6 CPGs had a score above 90% in domain 4. Prophylaxis should be strictly limited to patients with varicose bleeding, low ascites protein levels and a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin), third-generation cephalosporins (G3) (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) are recommended for preventing infections in patients with cirrhosis or liver failure.

We recorded 23 deaths (22.1%) among the COVID-19 patients vs 8 deaths (5.8%) among other patients. The severe-critical clinical stage increased the risk of mortality vs. mild-moderate stage (aHR: 26.8, p < 0.001). The values of CtE and CtN2 did not influence mortality significantly.  Conclusion:   In symptomatic patients, serological tests are a support which makes it possible to refer patients to the dedicated COVID-19 units and treat a greater number of COVID-19 patients.

In the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), salmonellosis is believed to be primarily foodborne, but the relative contribution of animal reservoirs is unknown.  Methods:   The analysis included 4543 serotyped isolates from animal reservoirs and 30,073 serotyped isolates from domestically acquired human cases in NSW between January 2008 and August 2019. We used a Bayesian source attribution methodology to estimate the proportion of foodborne Salmonella infections attributable to broiler chickens, layer chickens, ruminants, pigs, and an unknown or unsampled source. Additional analyses included covariates for four time periods and five levels of rurality.  Results:   A single serotype, S. Typhimurium, accounted for 65-75% of included cases during 2008-2014 but < 50% during 2017-2019. Attribution to layer chickens was highest during 2008-2010 (48.7%, 95% CrI 24.2-70.3%) but halved by 2017-2019 (23.1%, 95% CrI 5.7-38.9%) and was lower in the rural and remote populations than in the majority urban population. The proportion of cases attributed to the unsampled source was 11.3% (95% CrI 1.2%-22.1%) overall, but higher in rural and remote populations. The proportion of cases attributed to pork increased from approximately 20% in 2009-2016 to approximately 40% in 2017-2019, coinciding with a rise in cases due to Salmonella ser. 4,5,12:i:-.

The use of data-driven models enables clinicians to accurately interpret potential information, examine the progression of CD4 count, and deal with patient heterogeneity due to patient-specific effects. Quantile-based regression models can be used to illustrate the entire conditional distribution of an outcome and identify various covariates effects at the respective location.  Methods:   This study uses the quantile mixed-effects model that assumes an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the error term. The model also incorporated multiple random effects to consider the correlation among observations. The exact maximum likelihood estimation was implemented using the Stochastic Approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters. This study used the Centre of the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 002 Acute Infection Study data. In this study, the response variable is the longitudinal CD4 count from HIV-infected patients who were initiated on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), and the explanatory variables are relevant baseline characteristics of the patients.  Results:   The analysis obtained robust parameters estimates at various locations of the conditional distribution. For instance, our result showed that baseline BMI (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text]), baseline viral load (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]), and post-HAART initiation (at [Formula: see text] 0.05: [Formula: see text]) were major significant factors of CD4 count across fitted quantiles.  Conclusions:   CD4 cell recovery in response to post-HAART initiation across all fitted quantile levels was observed. Compared to HIV-infected patients with low viral load levels at baseline, HIV-infected patients enrolled in the treatment with a high viral load level at baseline showed a significant negative effect on CD4 cell counts at upper quantiles. HIV-infected patients registered with high BMI at baseline had improved CD4 cell count after treatment, but physicians should not ignore this group of patients clinically. It is also crucial for physicians to closely monitor patients with a low BMI before and after starting HAART.""","""['Ashenafi A Yirga', 'Sileshi F Melesse', 'Henry G Mwambi', 'Dawit G Ayele']""","""[' School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa. ashu3argaw@gmail.com.', ' School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South Africa.', ' Institute of Human Virology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""BMC Infect Dis""","""['Additive quantile mixed effects modelling with application to longitudinal CD4 count data.', 'Modelling CD4 counts before and after HAART for HIV infected patients in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa.', 'Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children is associated with a sustained effect on growth.', 'Early postseroconversion CD4 cell counts independently predict CD4 cell count recovery in HIV-1-postive subjects receiving antiretroviral therapy.', 'Study of the impact of HIV genotypic drug resistance testing on therapy efficacy.']"""

It is difficult to identify possible sources of infection among sporadic cases based on a routine surveillance system. Therefore, a more effective surveillance system needs to be established.  Methods:   The epidemiological data of hepatitis A were obtained from a routine surveillance system. Patients with HAV confirmed at the local hospitals were asked to complete a questionnaire that included additional case information and possible sources of infection. Serum and fecal specimens were also collected for testing HAV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the 321-nucleotide segment of the VP1/2A junction region was sequenced to determine the HAV genotype.  Results:   In 2019, 110 HAV cases were reported in Beijing, with an incidence rate of 0.51/100,000. 61(55.5%) of these patients were male. The greatest proportion of these patients were aged from 30 to 60 years. The rate was lower in suburban and rural areas compared to urban areas. Contaminated food consumption, particularly seafood consumption, was the primary potential source of infection. Among the 16 specimens of confirmed HAV cases that could be sequenced, 93.8% were HAV IA, and 6.3% were HAV IB. In addition, the samples collected from all HAV sequences in this investigation showed 89.4-100% nucleotide homology. Two groups (each with three sporadic cases) showed 100% nucleotide homology. The three sporadic cases in one group had the same possible source of infection: contaminated salad with raw vegetables and seafood. In the other group, the three sporadic cases did not have an epidemiological connection.  Conclusions:   In a low HAV prevalent area, such as in Beijing, incorporating molecular epidemiology into the routine surveillance system could help inform possible clusters of outbreaks and provide support for earlier control of HAV transmission. Nevertheless, increased sampling from detected cases and improved specimen quality are needed to implement such a system.""","""['Huai Wang', 'Weixin Chen', 'Wenting Zhou', 'Feng Qiu', 'Wenjiao Yin', 'Jingyuan Cao', 'Pei Gao', 'Qianli Yuan', 'Min Lv', 'Shuang Bai', 'Jiang Wu']""","""[' Institute for Immunization and Prevention, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing Research Center for Preventive Medicine, No.16, He Ping Li Middle Street, Dongcheng District, 100013, Beijing, China.', ' NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 102206, Beijing, China.', ' Institute for Immunization and Prevention, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing Research Center for Preventive Medicine, No.16, He Ping Li Middle Street, Dongcheng District, 100013, Beijing, China. wj81732@hotmail.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""BMC Infect Dis""","""['Co-circulation of genotype IA and new variant IB hepatitis A virus in outbreaks of acute hepatitis in Hungary--2003/2004.', 'Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis A outbreaks and sporadic cases, Latvia, 2017 to 2019.', 'Hepatitis A Outbreaks and Environmental Circulation of Genotype IA Strains in the São Paulo City, 2017-2018.', 'Genotyping of acute hepatitis a virus isolates from China, 2003-2008.', 'Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of Hepatitis A Viruses Circulating in Tokyo, 2016-2017.', 'Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on depression in patients with schizophrenia: A mini-review of the current evidence.', 'Mechanistic insight into the protective and pathogenic immune-responses against SARS-CoV-2.', 'A community-wide epidemic of hepatitis A virus genotype IA associated with consumption of shellfish in Yantai, eastern China, January to March 2020.']"""

North Carolina's program, the North Carolina Plan of Safe Care (NC POSC), was implemented in August 2017 and involves coordination between multiple agencies.METHODS We conducted a quality improvement project to assess implementation of the North Carolina Plan of Safe Care in Wake County through interviews with key stakeholders involved in program delivery including health care providers (n = 7), child protective services social workers (CPS; n = 14), and care managers at Care Coordination for Children (CC4C; n = 10). We also analyzed data on Plan of Safe Care notifications to Wake County CPS from January 2018 to October 2019.RESULTS Several key themes emerged in stakeholder interviews, including 1) lack of awareness of the program among health care providers; 2) gaps in information sharing and communication between agencies; 3) concerns regarding CPS notifications for all substance exposure types, including prenatal exposure to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD); 4) common family needs and service referrals; 5) challenges engaging with families; 6) lack of knowledge among health care providers and CPS social workers regarding CC4C; and 7) benefits of the program for infants and families. From January 2018 to October 2019, 91% of notifications for substance-affected infants received by Wake County CPS as part of the NC POSC were screened-in for a maltreatment assessment. Of those screened-in, more than two-thirds (70%) involved prenatal marijuana exposure only.LIMITATIONS This project was limited to one county.CONCLUSIONS As NC POSC implementation continues, further consideration of the infrastructure and guidance available to address the implementation challenges identified by stakeholders will be essential to meeting family needs and promoting infant safety and well-being.""","""['Anna E Austin', 'Meghan E Shanhan', 'Paige Rosemond', 'Molly C Berkoff', 'Catherine Joyner', 'Scott Proescholdbell']""","""[' Assistant professor, Department of Maternal and Child Health, Gillings School of Global Public Health and research scientist, Injury Prevention Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. anna.austin@unc.edu.', ' Assistant professor, Department of Maternal and Child Health, Gillings School of Global Public Health and research scientist, Injury Prevention Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', ' Director, Division of Child Welfare, Wake County Human Services, Raleigh, North Carolina.', ' Pediatrician, Division of Child Welfare, Wake County Human Services, Raleigh, North Carolina; principal investigator/medical director, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', "" Executive director, Child Maltreatment Prevention Leadership Team, Women's and Children's Health Section, Division of Public Health, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Raleigh, North Carolina."", ' Epidemiology, surveillance, and informatics unit manager, Injury and Violence Prevention Branch, Division of Public Health, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Raleigh, North Carolina.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""N C Med J""","""['A process for developing community consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Pennsylvania Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting.', 'From concept to application: the impact of a community-wide intervention to improve the delivery of preventive services to children.', 'County-level correlates of dental service utilization for low income pregnant women.

The patients were divided into routine nursing control group (routine control group) and early mobility bundle management group (bundle group), with 36 cases in each group. The routine control group received regular nursing, including monitoring vital signs, raising the head of the bed, turning over and buttoning the back every 2 hours, daily awakening, airway humidification, prevention of digestive tract ulcer, analgesia and sedation management, prevention of deep vein embolism, pipeline management, regular monitoring of blood gas analysis and electrolytes according to the changes of the condition, prevention of aspiration, prevention of bacterial colonization, correct hand hygiene, and so on. The bundle group implemented the cluster early mobility strategy based on routine nursing. Firstly, set up a professional team to execute the standards.

Methods:   This randomized and double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 2019. One hundred and forty samples were randomly divided into intranasal ketamine (A) and intravenous ketorolac (B). Group (A) received ketamine intranasal (0.75 mg/kg, max 75 mg), and group B received intravenous ketorolac (30 mg). Headache severity was measured on arrival, 30, 60, and 120 min after intervention with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The side effects were recorded an hour after the intervention.  Result:   The mean difference of pain intensity 30, 60, and 120 min after the intervention between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the first 30 min, significant changes were observed in the VAS levels of the two groups. These changes were significantly greater in the intranasal ketamine group (p < 0.001). Side effects such as fatigue, dizziness, general discomfort, nausea, increased heart rate, and hypertension were significantly higher in the ketamine group (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Intranasal ketamine and intravenous ketorolac both effectively reduced headaches. However, more analgesic effects of intranasal ketamine in a short time can be considered as a selective approach to reducing headaches.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between these immunity markers and frailty, and it remains unknown whether they are predictive of incident frailty in older adults in general. Hence, we aimed to examine the association of these immunity markers with the risk of incident frailty.  Results:   Overall, 1822 older adults (mean age was 78.03 ± 4.46 years) were included in the Rugao Longitudinal Aging Study. NLR, PLR and SII were calculated from blood cell counts. The frailty definition was based on the Fried phenotype. At baseline, 200 (10.98%) individuals were defined as frailty, and no significant associations of NLR, PLR and SII with frailty were found. During the 2-year follow-up, 180 (15.67%) individuals were new-onset frailty. After adjustment, an increased logNLR (odds ratio [OR] 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-7.18), logPLR (OR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.01-6.53) and logSII (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.16-4.78) were significantly associated with a higher risk of incident frailty in all individuals. Additionally, the associations of logNLR (OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.54-11.62 logPLR (OR 3.38, 95% CI: 1.17-9.91) and logSII (OR 2.56, 95% CI: 1.15-5.72) with incident frailty were remained after excluding individuals with comorbidities. In further analyzed, individuals with higher levels of NLR and SII had higher risk of incident frailty when we stratified individuals by quartiles of these immunity markers.

This paper aims (1) provide practical guidance for researchers to co-produce interventions ready for clinical trial by describing the 4-stage process we followed, the challenges experienced and practical tips for researchers wanting to co-produce an intervention for a clinical trial; (2) describe, as an exemplar, the development of our intervention package.  Method:   We used an Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) approach to co-produce a telehealth-delivered exercise program for people with stroke. The 4-stage process comprised of (1) a start-up planning phase with the co-production team. (2) Content development with knowledge user informants. (3) Design of an intervention protocol. (4) Protocol refinement.  Results and reflections:   The four stages of intervention development involved an 11-member co-production team and 32 knowledge user informants. Challenges faced included balancing conflicting demands of different knowledge user informant groups, achieving shared power and collaborative decision making, and optimising knowledge user input. Components incorporated into the telehealth-delivered exercise program through working with knowledge user informants included: increased training for intervention therapists; increased options to tailor the intervention to participant's needs and preferences; and re-naming of the program. Key practical tips include ways to minimise the power differential between researchers and consumers, and ensure adequate preparation of the co-production team.

However, previous studies were susceptible to potential confounding factors and reverse causation bias, likely leading to inconsistent and biased results.  Objectives:   To decipher the potentially mutual relationship between gut microbiota and ALS, we used a bidirectional two-sample MR approach to examine the associations between the gut microbiome and ALS.  Results:   Using the inverse variance-weighted method, OTU10032 unclassified Enterobacteriaceae species-level OTU and unclassified Acidaminococcaceae were associated with a higher risk of ALS (per relative abundance: OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = 0.011 and OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P = 0.009, respectively). Importantly, Gamma-Glu-Phe was showed potential deleterious effects on the risk of ALS (genetically predicted per a 1-standard deviation increase in the level of Gamma-Glu-Phe: OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.50-2.55; P = 0.012). Sensitivity analysis of the two candidate genera and metabolites using the MR-Egger and weighted-median methods produced similar estimates, and no horizontal pleiotropy or outliers were observed. Intriguingly, genetically predicted ALS was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of OTU4607_Sutterella (per 1-unit higher log odds: β, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.27-3.18; P = 0.020) and Lactobacillales_ORDER (per 1-unit higher log odds: β, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.09-0.94; P = 0.019).

In December 2019, Portugal announced the inclusion of the rotavirus vaccine, already available for private purchase, in the National Immunization Program. We present the first nationwide analysis of the burden and trends of rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis hospital episodes in children under five years old in mainland Portugal (2014 - 2017).  Material and methods:   We used the hospital morbidity database and the Death Certificate Information System to identify hospital episodes and deaths of rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis based on the codes of the International Classification of Diseases. We described the number and rates of hospital episodes disaggregated by age group, sex, geographical units, and the seasonality and trends over the study period.  Results:   On average, during the study period, there were 1985 annual hospital episodes among children under five years old. The annual rate was 48.0/10 000 children (95% CI 46.9 - 49.0). Rates were consistently higher in younger children, and 67.8% episodes occurred in children under 24 months. We found a seasonal pattern with a major peak in the early spring.  Discussion:   Our results were consistent with the current knowledge on rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis hospital episodes in Europe. Additional studies are needed to identify the risk factors and high-risk groups for hospital attendance.  Conclusion:   Rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis hospital episodes in children under five years old in mainland Portugal represent an important health and economic burden. In the future, monitoring this burden and these trends in relation with rotavirus vaccine coverage could be useful in order to assess the impact of the vaccination programme on the change in hospital episodes.""","""['Héloïse Lucaccioni', 'Rita Sá Machado']""","""[' Division of Epidemiology and Statistics.

Aim:   To summarize an international consensus on diagnosis and treatment of young people with comorbid ADHD and SUD.  Method:   In a modified Delphi-study, a multidisciplinary, international group of 55 experts strived to reach consensus on 37 recommendations.  Results:   Consensus was reached on 36 recommendations. Routine screening of ADHD and/or SUD is important. For the treatment of co-morbid SUD and ADHD in youths, both psychosocial and pharmacological treatment should be considered. Psychosocial treatment should preferably consist of psychoeducation, motivational interviewing (MI), and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on SUD or both disorders. Long-acting stimulants are recommended as first choice pharmacotherapy, preferably embedded in psychosocial treatment.

One hundred and elven strains of CoVs i.e., Alphacoronaviruses (Alpha-CoVs; n = 12), Betacoronaviruses (Beta-CoVs; n = 37), Gammacoronaviruses (Gamma-CoVs; n = 46), and Deltacoronaviruses (Delta-CoVs; n = 16) were selected for this purpose. Phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVs clustered together with Bat-CoVs and MERS-CoV of Beta-CoVs (C). The IBV HH06 of Avian-CoVs was closely related to Duck-CoV and partridge S14, LDT3 (teal and chicken host). Beluga whale-CoV (SW1) and Bottlenose dolphin-CoVs of mammalian origin branched distantly from other animal origin viruses, however, making group with Avian-CoVs altogether into Gamma-CoVs. The motif analysis indicated well-conserved domains on S protein, which were similar within the same phylogenetic class and but variable at different domains of different origins.

Australia's early success in suppressing COVID-19 resulted in lengthy periods without community transmission. However, a slow vaccine rollout leaves this geographically isolated population vulnerable to leakage of new variants from quarantine, which requires internal travel restrictions, disruptive lockdowns, contact tracing and testing surges. Methods: To assist long term sustainment of limited public health resources, we sought a method of continuous, real-time COVID-19 risk monitoring that could be used to alert non-specialists to the level of epidemic risk on a sub-national scale. After an exploratory data assessment, we selected four COVID-19 metrics used by public health in their periodic threat assessments, applied a business continuity matrix and derived a numeric indicator; the COVID-19 Risk Estimate (CRE), to generate a daily spot CRE, a 3 day net rise and a seven day rolling average. We used open source data updated daily from all Australian states and territories to monitor the CRE for over a year. Results: Upper and lower CRE thresholds were established for the CRE seven day rolling average, corresponding to risk of sustained and potential outbreak propagation, respectively. These CRE thresholds were used in a real-time map of Australian COVID-19 risk estimate distribution by state and territory.

In this study, we aimed to quantitatively explore the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic and its control measures on five major STD epidemics in China. Methods: A monthly number of newly reported cases of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, gonorrhea, and syphilis from January 2010 to December 2020 were extracted to establish autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Each month's absolute percentage error (APE) between the actual value and model-predicted value of each STD in 2020 was calculated to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on the STDs. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to explore the confirmed COVID-19 case numbers and the COVID-19 control measures' correlations with the case numbers and the APEs of five STDs in 2020. Results: The actual number of five STDs in China was more than 50% lower than the predicted number in the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic, especially in February. Among them, the actual number of cases of hepatitis C, gonorrhea, and syphilis in February 2020 was more than 100% lower than the predicted number (APE was -102.3, -109.0, and -100.4%, respectively). After the sharply declines of STDs' reported cases in early 2020, the case numbers recovered quickly after March. The epidemic of STDs was negatively associated with the COVID-19 epidemic and its control measures, especially for restrictions on gathering size, close public transport, and stay-at-home requirements (p < 0.05).

Several computational models have been proposed to inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models often depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection. Among these tools, the analytic framework known as ""dynamic causal modeling"" (DCM) has been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, the first areas in Europe to contend with the outbreak, and analyzed the predictive validity of the model and also its suitability in highlighting the hidden factors governing the pandemic diffusion. By taking into account data from the beginning of the pandemic, the model could faithfully predict the dynamics of outbreak diffusion varying from region to region.

Around 8.5% of women who attend test HPV-positive with normal cytology (HPV+/normal). We aimed to explore women's information needs and suggestions for improvements to result communication following an HPV+/normal result, among those with higher and lower levels of education. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 women aged 24-63 who had tested HPV+/normal at routine screening. Secondary qualitative data, not previously reported, were analysed using Framework Analysis to compare themes between those with education lower-than-degree-level vs. degree-level-or-higher (n = 15 in each group). Regardless of education level, women had unanswered questions about their result meaning and the HPV primary screening protocol. Expectations of cervical screening did not always match the service provided, especially regarding content of letters and mode of result delivery. Women with lower education were less clear about the meaning of normal cytology and its link to HPV; and had difficulty sourcing information after their result. Pragmatic suggestions were made for preferences in content, wording, format, and delivery of information in patient communications. Overall, our findings point to areas which can be used by policymakers and healthcare professionals to inform content and communication of results, as HPV primary screening continues to be implemented and refined worldwide.

Eighty pediatric GBS infection cases were enrolled from a teaching hospital in Shanghai between 2009 and 2020; among them, 72.5% (58/80) were diagnosed with bloodstream infection (BSI). Sequence types (STs) and serotypes of associated GBS strains were identified, and most of the Ib/clonal complex (CC)12 (86.7%, 13/15) strains caused BSIs, which was significantly higher than that of the genetically related clone Ib/CC10 (20%, 2/10; p < 0.05). Ib/CC12 BSI (30.8%) mortality was significantly higher than that of non-Ib/CC12 BSI (2.2%; p < 0.05). Virulence genes associated with adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion were detected using polymerase chain reaction. The fbsA and gbsPC1 positive rates of Ib/CC12 strains was higher than that of non-Ib/CC12 strains, whereas cpsIaJ, cpsJ, cpsI, and cpsG positive rates were lower than those of non-Ib/CC12 (p < 0.05). In in vitro studies, the Ib/CC12 strains had strong invasiveness in RAW264.7 cells, but less invasiveness in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and human mammary epithelial cells when compared to other two clones. In the in vivo model, the Ib/CC12 GBS invaded the circulation system more rapidly after intraperitoneal injection, was more difficult to eradicate by phagocytes, and caused significantly higher mortality than Ib/CC10 and III/ST17 (p < 0.05). Genome analysis showed that the Ib/CC12 strains had two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas systems and carried more antibiotic resistant genes, which conferred resistance to macrolides, clindamycin, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. The Ib/CC12 strains had 45 unique annotated genes compared to that of Ib/CC10, including the pathogen-related toxin/antitoxin system, PezA/T. In conclusion, Ib/CC12 is an emerging hypervirulent multiresistant GBS clone that causes invasive and fatal infections in pediatric patients.

The District Health Information System, version 2 (DHIS2) has been widely adopted across countries and is expected to increase the quality of reporting of RHIS. In this study, we evaluated the quality of reporting of key indicators of childhood malaria from January 2014 through December 2017, the first 4 years of DHIS2 implementation in Senegal.  Methods:   Monthly data on the number of confirmed and suspected malaria cases as well as tests done were extracted from the Senegal DHIS2. Reporting completeness was measured as the number of monthly reports received divided by the expected number of reports in a given year. Completeness of indicator data was measured as the percentage of non-missing indicator values. We used a quasi-Poisson model with natural cubic spline terms of month of reporting to impute values missing at the facility level. We used the imputed values to take into account the percentage of malaria cases that were missed due to lack of reporting. Consistency was measured as the absence of moderate and extreme outliers, internal consistency between related indicators, and consistency of indicators over time.  Results:   In contrast to public facilities of which 92.7% reported data in the DHIS2 system during the study period, only 15.3% of the private facilities used the reporting system. At the national level, completeness of facility reporting increased from 84.5% in 2014 to 97.5% in 2017. The percentage of expected malaria cases reported increased from 76.5% in 2014 to 94.7% in 2017. Over the study period, the percentage of malaria cases reported across all districts was on average 7.5% higher (P < 0.01) during the rainy season relative to the dry season. Reporting completeness rates were lower among hospitals compared to health centers and health posts. The incidence of moderate and extreme outlier values was 5.2 and 2.3%, respectively. The number of confirmed malaria cases increased by 15% whereas the numbers of suspected cases and tests conducted more than doubled from 2014 to 2017 likely due to a policy shift towards universal testing of pediatric febrile cases.  Conclusions:   The quality of reporting for malaria indicators in the Senegal DHIS2 has improved over time and the data are suitable for use to monitor progress in malaria programs, with an understanding of their limitations. Senegalese health authorities should maintain the focus on broader adoption of DHIS2 reporting by private facilities, the sustainability of district-level data quality reviews, facility-level supervision and feedback mechanisms at all levels of the health system.""","""['Pierre Muhoza', 'Roger Tine', 'Adama Faye', 'Ibrahima Gaye', 'Scott L Zeger', 'Abdoulaye Diaw', 'Alioune Badara Gueye', 'Almamy Malick Kante', 'Andrea Ruff', 'Melissa A Marx']""","""[' Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N.

Management of CHF in Australia is heavily centred around the general practitioner (GP). Australian and international literature indicates there is a gap between current and best practice in CHF management. There is little known about the non-pharmacological aspects of management, or CHF management in a rural Australian context. This study aimed to identify what Australian GPs practicing in the Northern Rivers Region of New South Wales, Australia, perceived were the barriers and enablers in the non-pharmacological management of CHF amongst community dwelling patients, to inform healthcare access, resourcing and delivery in Australian rural environments.  Methods:   Qualitative study involving a realist thematic analysis of data collected from semi-structured face-to-face interviews.  Results:   Fifteen GPs and GP trainees participated. Four interlinked key themes underpinning GPs' experiences with non-pharmacological management of CHF were interpreted from the interview data: (1) resources, (2) complexity of heart failure, (3) relationships, and (4) patient demographics, priorities and views affect how patients engage with non-pharmacological management of CHF.  Conclusion:   Rural Australian GPs face considerable barriers to non-pharmacological management of CHF. The data suggests that increased rural Australian health services and community transportation, multidisciplinary management, and stronger professional networks have the potential to be invaluable enablers of CHF management.

By focusing on health outcomes in relation to the cost of care, value-based healthcare (VBHC) proposes a strategy to optimize quality of care and cost-efficiency. Its implementation may provide an answer to the increasing pressure to optimize spending in healthcare while improving patient outcomes. This paper describes a pragmatic value-based healthcare framework for HIV care.  Methods:   A value-based HIV healthcare framework was developed during a series of roundtable discussions bringing together 16 clinical stakeholder representatives from the Belgian HIV reference centers and 2 VBHC specialists. Each round of discussions was focused on a central question translating a concept or idea to the next level of practical implementation: 1) how can VBHC principles be translated into value-based HIV care drivers; 2) how can these value-based HIV care divers be translated into value-based care objectives and activities; and 3) how can value-based HIV care objectives and activities be translated into value-based care indicators. Value drivers were linked to concrete objectives and activities using a logical framework approach. Finally, specific, measurable, and acceptable structure, process and outcomes indicators were defined to complement the framework.  Results:   Our framework identifies 4 core value areas where HIV care would benefit most from improvements: Prevention, improvement of the cascade of care, providing patient-centered HIV care and sustaining a state-of-the-art HIV disease management context. These 4 core value areas were translated into 12 actionable core value objectives. For each objective, example activities were proposed. Indicators are suggested for each level of the framework (outcome indicators for value areas and objectives, process indicators for suggested activities).  Conclusions:   This framework approach outlines how to define a patient- and public health centered value-based HIV care paradigm.

Bevezetés: Nagyszámú kutatás igazolta, hogy a dohányzás növeli a legjelentősebb krónikus betegségek kockázatát. Habár 2009 óta csökkenő tendenciát mutat Magyarországon a hagyományos dohányzók aránya, az e-cigarettát kipróbálóké az utóbbi években folyamatosan növekszik. Célkitűzés: A 2018-ban a felnőtt lakosság körében végzett Népegészségügyi Felmérés dohányzásra és e-cigaretta-használatra vonatkozó eredményeinek bemutatása az előző vizsgálatok tükrében. Módszer: A kérdőíves felmérésben 1586 fő került személyesen lekérdezésre. Az iteratív súlyozás a többlépcsős mintavételi designhatást és a 2016-os mikrocenzus adatait vette figyelembe. Eredmények: 2018-ban a dohányzók aránya a magyar felnőtt lakosság körében 28,7% (95% MT: 26,3-31,1%), az e-cigarettát használók aránya pedig 1,7% (95% MT: 1,1-2,5%) volt. Az iskolai végzettség a 65 év alattiak esetében a dohányzást befolyásoló tényező volt (EH: 3,32; 95% MT: 2,53-4,34), de a 65 éves és annál idősebb korcsoportban már nem (EH: 1,11; 95% MT: 0,59-2,09). Az e-cigarettát kipróbálók és használók között a leginkább említett (54,3% 95% MT: 44,0-64,5%) motivációs tényezőcsoport a dohányzásról való leszokással, az ártalomcsökkentéssel és a visszaesés megelőzésével volt kapcsolatos. A 65 éves és idősebb korcsoportban a dohányzók aránya 2015-höz képest emelkedett. 2018-ban az alapfokú iskolai végzettségűek körében volt a legmagasabb a dohányzók aránya, míg 2014-ben az érettségivel nem rendelkező középfokú végzettségűek körében. Következtetés: Bár összességében csökkent, az alacsony iskolai végzettségűek és az idősek körében emelkedett a dohányzók aránya Magyarországon. Az e-cigarettát kipróbálók és használók száma növekvő tendenciát mutat hazánkban. Eredményeink az alacsony iskolai végzettségűekre kiemelten fókuszáló, megelőző és leszokást támogató népegészségügyi alprogramokat is tartalmazó komplex beavatkozást sürgetnek. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(1): 31-38.  Introduction:   The body of evidence suggests that smoking increases the risk of the most prevalent chronic diseases. Although the proportion of traditional smokers in Hungary has been on a declining trend since 2009, the proportion of those who tried e-cigarette has been steadily increasing in recent years.  Objective:   To present - in the light of previous studies - the results of the Public Health Survey among adults in 2018 on smoking and e-cigarette use.  Method:   1586 persons were personally interviewed in a survey. The iterative weighting algorithm considered both the design effect of multistaged sampling and the 2016 Hungarian microcensus.  Results:   In 2018, the proportion of smokers in the Hungarian adult population was 28.7% (95% CI 26.3-31.1%), and the proportion of e-cigarette users was 1.7% (95% CI 1.1-2.5%). Educational level was a predictor of smoking among respondents younger than 65 years old (OR 3.32; 95% CI 2.53-4.34), but not for those aged 65 years or older (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.59-2.09). Among e-cigarette ever or current users, the most commonly mentioned (54.3% 95% CI 44.0-64.5%) motivational factor-group to try or use e-cigarettes included motivations to quit smoking, to reduce harm, and to avoid relapsing. In the population aged 65 years old or older, the proportion of smokers increased compared to 2015. The proportion of smokers was the highest among those with primary education in 2018, while in 2014, it was the highest among those with secondary education without a graduation certificate.  Conclusion:   In Hungary, although overall smoking rates are declining, the smoking rate in the low educational group and among the elderly increased. The number of people trying or using e-cigarettes is showing an increasing trend in our country. Our results call for a complex public health intervention program including prevention and smoking cessation supporting subprograms with high focus on those with primary education.

Thrombosis development and shared risk factors""","""Összefoglaló. A malignus daganat és a stroke egy-egy betegnél gyakran kombinálódik, sokszor egyidejűleg diagnosztizálják, vagy rövid idő telik el a két kórkép felismerése között. Az együttes megjelenés hátterében elsősorban a hasonló tradicionális rizikófaktorok állhatnak: az idősebb életkor, a magas vérnyomás, a hyperlipidaemia, a cukorbetegség, az elhízás és a dohányzás. Az átfedő kockázati tényezőkön túl a daganat által okozott hiperkoaguláció artériás és vénás thrombosis kialakulásához vezethet. A hiperkoaguláció hátterének kutatása főként a thrombocyták és a szöveti faktor aktiválására és a heparanáz fokozott expressziójára fókuszált, és felvetődött a neutrophil extracelluláris csapdák szerepe is. A daganat által okozott hiperkoagulációhoz társuló cryptogen (tradicionális rizikófaktor nélküli) stroke-ban sokszor található magasabb D-dimer-szint, és a CT/MRI-képeken gyakrabban látszanak multifokális, több ér ellátási területében megjelenő ischaemiás laesiók, melyek ritkábban fordulnak elő a tradicionális rizikófaktorokkal magyarázható stroke-okban. Az előzőkön kívül a daganatok kezelésére alkalmazott kemoterápia és sugárterápia is emeli a stroke kockázatát. A malignus daganatokhoz társuló stroke-ok megelőzése érdekében további vizsgálatok szükségesek a daganat által okozott hiperkoaguláció és vascularis változások pontosabb megértéséhez. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(1): 3-11. Summary. Cancer and stroke have long been studied individually, but their detrimental forces together have also been a strong point of focus. The occurrence of both cancer and stroke in a patient is often a reflection of their similar risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and smoking), however, a subgroup of the cancer stroke population is believed to occur due to cancer-associated hypercoagulability. A deeper look into the cancer-associated hypercoagulable environment has indicated that thrombosis may be explained by cancer's role in several factors, including activation of platelets and tissue factor, elevated expression of heparanase and influence on neutrophilic extracellular traps. When a cryptogenic stroke (stroke lacking the aforementioned risk factors) occurs due to the cancer-induced hypercoagulation state, patient serum D-dimer levels have been found elevated, and CT/MRI images of the brain have shown multivascular infarctions compared to stroke patients with traditional risk factors. Additionally, cancer treatment - chemotherapy and radiation - have also been found to increase the occurrence of cerebral vascular thrombosis. Further investigations are required to better understand cancer-associated vascular pathophysiologic changes and how to discern their unique strokes compared to strokes from other etiologies. With these insights, the prevalence of strokes in the cancer population could be decreased.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of DVT and its association with health-related quality of life among Greek nurses.  Methods:   This is a multicenter descriptive correlation study. The sample of the study was nursing staff working in Greek public hospitals. The diagnosis of DVT was set by Hicks's clinical criteria.  Results:   The study included 6304 nurses with a mean age of 47.4 ± 4.9 years. Diagnosed by a physician, DVT had 544 (8.6%) participants. The mean score of the overall dimension of physical health-related quality of life was 68.1 ± 21.9 and the overall score of mental health scale was 53.3 ± 10.4. The odds of DVT occurrence increased dramatically for female gender (CI: 27.76, 95% CI: 8.12-94.89, p = 0.001). Increased odds were found also for advanced age (CI: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.33, p = 0.001), advanced BMI (CI: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10, p = 0.001), and smoking (CI: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.51-4.90, p = 0.001).

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population. It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic, increasing suffering. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre, compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods:   Female breast cancer patients of all ages receiving either adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative therapies were recruited for the study. All patients were screened for current or previous COVID-19 infection. The participants completed a self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, the Stress and Coping Inventory (SCI), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Distress Thermometer (DT), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30, and the BR23.  Results:   Eighty-two breast cancer patients were included. Therapy status and social demographic factors did not have a significant effect on the distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the DT pre and during COVID-19 pandemic did not differ significantly. Using the self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, we detected three distinct subgroups demonstrating different levels of concerns in relation to SARS-CoV-2. The subgroup with the highest levels of concern reported significantly decreased life quality, related parameters and symptoms.  Conclusions:   This monocentric study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected psychological health in a subpopulation of breast cancer patients. The application of a self-created ""COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire"" could potentially be used to help identify breast cancer patients who are susceptible to increased psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore may need additional intensive psychological support.

Exploration of pregnant individuals' psychosocial condition using a qualitative lens during an infectious outbreak is limited. In this study we explore pregnant individuals' lived experiences as well as their psychological and behavioural responses during COVID-19 with the goal of providing useful strategies from the patient's perspective to enable health care providers to help pregnant patients navigate this and future pandemics.  Methods:   Pregnant individuals between 20-weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum who received maternity care from an urban academic interprofessional teaching unit in Toronto, Canada were invited to participate. Semi-structured 60 min interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. Interview questions probed psychological responses to the pandemic, behavioural and lifestyle changes, strategies to mitigate distress while pregnant during COVID-19 and advice for other patients and the healthcare team.  Results:   There were 12 participants, mean age 35 years (range 30-43 years), all 1 to 6 months postpartum. Six main themes emerged: 1) Childbearing-related challenges to everyday life; 2) Increased worry, uncertainty and fear; 3) Pervasive sense of loss; 4) Challenges accessing care; 5) Strategies for coping with pandemic stress; 6) Reflections and advice to other pregnant people and health care professionals. Pregnant individuals described lack of social support due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and a profound sense of loss of what they thought their pregnancy and postpartum period should have been. Advice to healthcare providers included providing mental health support, clear and up to date communication as well as more postpartum and breastfeeding support.  Conclusions:   These participants described experiencing psychosocial distress during their pregnancies and postpartum. In a stressful situation such as a global pandemic, health care providers need to play a pivotal role to ensure pregnant individuals feel supported and receive consistent care throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period. The health care provider should ensure that mental health concerns are addressed and provide postpartum and breastfeeding support. Without addressing this need for support, parental mental health, relationships, parent-infant bonding, and infant development may be negatively impacted.""","""['Sabrina Kolker', 'Anne Biringer', 'Jessica Bytautas', 'Haley Blumenfeld', 'Sahana Kukan', 'June C Carroll']""","""[' Ray D.

This model is of the form SEIR, where S stands for Susceptible people, E for Exposed (infected but not yet infectious) people, I for Infectious people, and R for Recovered people. The main characteristic of this model inspired from the disease biology and some realistic hypothesis is that the treatment is administered not only to infectious but also to exposed people. Moreover, this model is characterized by an open structure, as it considers the transfer of infected or infectious people to other regions more conducive to their care and accepts treatment for exposed or infectious patients coming from other regions without care facilities. Stability and bifurcation of the solutions of this model are investigated. It is found that saddle-focus bifurcation occurs when the contact parameter β passes through some critical values. The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation when the quality of treatment r is considered as a bifurcation parameter. It is shown also that the system exhibits saddle-node bifurcation, which is a transcritical bifurcation between equilibrium points. Numerical simulations are done to illustrate these theoretical results. Amazingly, the Hopf bifurcation suggests an unexpected and never suggested explanation of seasonality of such a disease, linked to the quality of treatment.""","""['M-S Abdelouahab', 'A Arama', 'R Lozi']""","""[' Laboratory of Mathematics and Their Interactions, Abdelhafid Boussouf University Center, Mila 43000, Algeria.', "" School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410083, People's Republic of China."", "" Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, LJAD, Nice 06108, France.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Chaos""","""['Bifurcation analysis for a delayed SEIR epidemic model with saturated incidence and saturated treatment function.', 'Mathematical modeling of intervention and low medical resource availability with delays: Applications to COVID-19 outbreaks in Spain and Italy.', 'Bifurcation analysis of a pair-wise epidemic model on adaptive networks.', 'Global Dynamics of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Epidemic Model with a Generalized Nonmonotone Incidence Rate.', 'Stability and Hopf bifurcation of an SIR epidemic model with density-dependent transmission and Allee effect.']"""

Prevalence of good adherence was not obviously different across diagnoses: 69.5% (N=212) for schizophrenia, 66.3% (N=142) for bipolar disorder, and 69.8% (N=521) for depression. Besides the focus on stabilized outpatients, other study biases included use of a research sample; limited to oral medications, ignoring long-acting injectable antipsychotics; and lack of data on active substance abuse, clinical severity, and insight. Logistic regression models explored predictors of good vs. poor adherence. The six self-reported variables studied were pharmacophobia, pharmacophilia, high psychological reactance, high internal health locus of control (LOC), high doctor LOC, and skepticism concerning specific medications. ORs were significant in 56% (47/84) of the statistical tests vs. 24% (23/98) of ORs significant in case of 7 demographic/clinical variables (p=0.001). At least 2/3 of the ORs for pharmacophobia, pharmacophilia and skepticism were significantly associated with adherence in cases and controls, indicating their independence from diagnoses. In need of replication, three other self-reported measures had differential effects on adherence across diagnoses. High psychological reactance was associated with decreased adherence to antidepressant medications in general, or for patients with mood disorders. High internal LOC as associated with poor adherence may reflect the distrust patients with schizophrenia or severe bipolar disorder have of other people. High doctor LOC was significantly associated with increased adherence only in patients with bipolar disorder, but was significant for all medications, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, indicating the relevance of the patient-psychiatrist relationship in these patients.

With the advent of vaccination in most countries, vaccine hesitancy, especially in Africa, is expected to reduce. We also believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would have substantial impact on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. A predictor model for COVID-19 infection pattern through to 2025 suggests that recurrent outbreaks are likely to occur. There is a prediction that Africa would not fully recover from the economic crises posed by the pandemic; nonetheless, we expect that economic activities on the continent will improve as countries undertake mass vaccinations and populace attain herd immunity. The growth of e-commerce has been remarkable during the pandemic and we don´t expect trend to decline anytime soon. The pandemic has led to technology and digital platform utilization and/or improvement, which invariably has the tendency to improve quality of lives in the future. These include effective big data monitoring, online shopping, among others. Our future trajectory for recurrent waves of COVID-19 is that these may occur in winter months in temperate climates. We believe that COVID-19 has strengthened Africa´s resilience to future pandemics.""","""['Seth Kwabena Amponsah', 'Benjamin Tagoe', 'Daniel Kwame Afriyie']""","""[' Department of Medical Pharmacology, University of Ghana Medical School, Accra, Ghana.', ' Fulfilment Operations and Academy, Zipline Ghana, Accra, Ghana.', ' Ghana Police Hospital, Accra, Ghana.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""['Insights into COVID-19 Vaccine Development Based on Immunogenic Structural Proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Host Immune Responses, and Herd Immunity.', 'The British variant of the new coronavirus-19 (Sars-Cov-2) should not create a vaccine problem.', 'The Long Road Toward COVID-19 Herd Immunity: Vaccine Platform Technologies and Mass Immunization Strategies.', 'Vaccine hesitancy among people with multiple sclerosis.', 'Can Africa achieve herd immunity?']"""

Given the importance of mental models, a new tool to assess mental models has been developed: the Mental Model Mapping Tool (M-Tool). M-Tool was designed to have a standardized format and to be user-friendly for low literacy populations, using pictograms and audio instructions. In this paper, we evaluate M-Tool's application in two studies with Tanzanian fishers. In Study 1, we investigated M-tool's convergent validity compared to standard interviewing methods (n = 30). Study 2 investigated M-Tool's construct validity by relating mental model complexity to participants' education level (n = 185), a relationship that has been well established. The findings show that (1) mental models produced with M-Tool are more complex than mental models obtained through interviewing techniques; (2) model composition is similar across the two methods; and (3) participants with higher levels of education tend to produce more complex mental models with M-Tool than participants with lower levels of education, in line with previous research. These findings suggest that M-Tool can successfully capture mental models among diverse participants.

Here, PM2.5 pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown was traced and analyzed to clarify the sources and factors influencing PM2.5 in Guangzhou, with an emphasis on heavy pollution. The lockdown led to large reductions in industrial and traffic emissions, which significantly reduced PM2.5 concentrations in Guangzhou. Interestingly, the trend of PM2.5 concentrations was not consistent with traffic and industrial emissions, as minimum concentrations were observed in the fourth period (3/01-3/31, 22.45 μg/m3) of the lockdown. However, the concentrations of other gaseous pollutants, e.g., SO2, NO2 and CO, were correlated with industrial and traffic emissions, and the lowest values were noticed in the second period (1/24-2/03) of the lockdown. Meteorological correlation analysis revealed that the decreased PM2.5 concentrations during COVID-19 can be mainly attributed to decreased industrial and traffic emissions rather than meteorological conditions. When meteorological factors were included in the PM2.5 composition and backward trajectory analyses, we found that long-distance transportation and secondary pollution offset the reduction of primary emissions in the second and third stages of the pandemic. Notably, industrial PM2.5 emissions from western, southern and southeastern Guangzhou play an important role in the formation of heavy pollution events. Our results not only verify the importance of controlling traffic and industrial emissions, but also provide targets for further improvements in PM2.5 pollution.""","""['Luyao Wen', 'Chun Yang', 'Xiaoliang Liao', 'Yanhao Zhang', 'Xuyang Chai', 'Wenjun Gao', 'Shulin Guo', 'Yinglei Bi', 'Suk-Ying Tsang', 'Zhi-Feng Chen', 'Zenghua Qi', 'Zongwei Cai']""","""[' Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for Contaminants Exposure and Health, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Institute of Environmental Health and Pollution Control, Guangdong University of Technology, Rm 510, Engineering Facility Building No.3, Guangzhou 510006, China.', ' State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', ' Guangzhou Meteorological Public Service Center, Guangzhou Meteorological Service, Guangzhou 510006, China.', ' School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', ' Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for Contaminants Exposure and Health, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Institute of Environmental Health and Pollution Control, Guangdong University of Technology, Rm 510, Engineering Facility Building No.3, Guangzhou 510006, China.

Recently, epidemiological and toxicological studies showed that exposure to PFAS had adverse impacts on pancreas and showed association with insulin abnormalities. To explore how PFAS may contribute to diabetes, we studied impacts of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) on cell viability and insulin release capacity of pancreatic β cells by using in vivo and in vitro methods. We found that 28-day administration with PFOS (10 mg/(kg body weight•day)) caused reductions of pancreas weight and islet size in male mice. PFOS administration also led to lower serum insulin level both in fasting state and after glucose infusion among male mice. For cell-based in vitro bioassay, we used mouse β-TC-6 cancer cells and found 48-hr exposure to PFOS decreased the cell viability at 50 μmol/L. By measuring insulin content in supernatant, 48-hr pretreatment of PFOS (100 μmol/L) decreased the insulin release capacity of β-TC-6 cells after glucose stimulation. Although these concentrations were higher than the environmental concentration of PFOS, it might be reasonable for high concentration of PFOS to exert observable toxic effects in mice considering mice had a faster removal efficiency of PFOS than human. PFOS exposure (50 μmol/L) to β-TC-6 cells induced intracellular accumulation of reactive oxidative specie (ROS). Excessive ROS induced the reactive toxicity of cells, which eventually invoke apoptosis and necrosis. Results in this study provide evidence for the possible causal link of exposure to PFOS and diabetes risk.""","""['Weiping Qin', 'Xiaomin Ren', 'Lixia Zhao', 'Lianghong Guo']""","""[' State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Eco-toxicology, Research Center for Eco-environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China.', ' Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China.

Material and methods:   From February to June 2019, experienced staff of TNP randomly collected fox and wolf faeces on and off hiking trails at altitudes from 850 m to 2,000 m above sea level. In total, 91 faecal samples from red foxes and 19 from wolves were collected. Genomic DNA was obtained by direct extraction from faecal samples using a commercial kit, and from taeniid eggs retrieved from the same samples after flotation.  Results:   A nested PCR screening of 91 red fox faeces indicated the prevalence of E. multilocularis of 4.4%. Positive samples were confirmed by sequencing parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1). Neither genomic DNA of E. multilocularis nor of E. granulosus s.l. was obtained from 19 wolves faeces, nor from taeniid eggs retrieved from these samples by initial flotation.

Background:   Previous studies documented the prevalence of RLS among patients with PD to be higher than in the general population, but conclusions regarding the aetiology and impact were contradictory.  Methods:   We examined 101 patients with idiopathic PD. All participants completed the five-dimension/five-level-EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the International Restless-Legs-syndrome-study-group rating Scale (IRLS).  Results:   The prevalence of RLS was 22.77 %. There were no statistically significant differences in levodopa or dopamine agonists (DA) doses between RLS-positive and negative participants. However, the use of levodopa as the last night-time medication was connected with a higher risk of RLS (OR=2.049, p=0.041). There was significantly lower prevalence of RLS in patients after surgical treatment for PD (p=0.024). Participants with RLS were at a greater risk for sleep disturbances (OR=3.866, p=0.023) and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR=7.202, p<0.001). Greater RLS symptoms were associated with worse QoL (higher IRLS score predicted higher EQ5D5L score, p=0.023).  Conclusion:   RLS is prevalent among PD patients and night-time dopaminergic over-excitation with levodopa plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Since the symptoms of RLS are associated with decreased QoL, early accurate diagnosis and appropriate adjustment of dopaminergic therapy can lead to immediate relief from RLS symptoms and to QoL improvement (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 34).""","""['M Minar', 'Z Kosutzka', 'K Danterova', 'K Gmitterova', 'I Straka', 'A Kusnirova', 'R Tosecka', 'R Juricek', 'M Kloc', 'K A Wyman-Chick', 'P Valkovic']""","""[]""","""2022""","""2022;123""","""Bratisl Lek Listy""","""[""Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease."", ""Restless legs syndrome in patients with Parkinson's disease: a comparative study on prevalence, clinical characteristics, quality of life and nutritional status."", 'Relation of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale with the Clinical Global Impression severity scale, the restless legs syndrome 6-item questionnaire, and the restless legs syndrome-quality of life questionnaire.', ""Restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease."", 'From bench to bedside: An overview of rotigotine for the treatment of restless legs syndrome.']"""

In this work we explore their effect on the epidemic growth by investigating an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in which individual mobility is taken into account. In the model individual agents move on a chessboard with a Lévy walk and, within each square, epidemic spreading follows the standard SIR model. These simple rules allow to reproduce the sub-exponential growth of the epidemic evolution observed during the Covid-19 epidemic waves in several countries and which cannot be captured by the standard SIR model. We show that we can tune the slowing-down of the epidemic spreading by changing the dynamics of the agents from Lévy to Brownian and we investigate how the interplay among different containment strategies mitigate the epidemic spreading. Finally we demonstrate that we can reproduce the epidemic evolution of the first and second COVID-19 waves in Italy using only 3 parameters, i.e , the infection rate, the removing rate, and the mobility in the country. We provide an estimate of the peak reduction due to imposed mobility restrictions, i. e., the so-called flattening the curve effect. Although based on few ingredients, the model captures the kinetic of the epidemic waves, returning mobility values that are consistent with a lock-down intervention during the first wave and milder limitations, associated to a weaker peak reduction, during the second wave.""","""['Matteo Paoluzzi', 'Nicoletta Gnan', 'Francesca Grassi', 'Marco Salvetti', 'Nicola Vanacore', 'Andrea Crisanti']""","""[' Departament de Física de la Matèria Condensada, Universitat de Barcelona, C.

We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines, also reducing person-to-person contacts. Moreover, we find that the individual patterns of visits are influenced by the strength of the NPIs policies, the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions.

We designed two new primer pairs to amplify only the immunodominant part of the S-gene for nanopore sequencing. Furthermore, we developed an automated ""S-Protein-Typer"" tool that analyzes and reports S-protein mutations on the amino acid level including a variant of concern indicator. Validation of our primer panel using SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens covering a broad Ct range showed successful amplification for 29/30 samples. Restriction to the region of interest freed sequencing capacity by a factor of 12-13, compared with whole-genome sequencing. Using either the MinION or Flongle flow cell, our sequencing strategy reduced the time required to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants accordingly. The S-Protein-Typer tool identified all mutations correctly when challenged with our sequenced samples and 50 deposited sequences covering all VOCs (December 2021).

Currently, this mutation, which is expressed on different SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide, has not been thoughtfully investigated. Therefore, we performed phylogenetic and biocomputational analysis to better understand SARS-CoV-2 Q675H mutants' evolutionary relationships with other circulating lineages and Q675H function in its molecular context. Our studies reveal that Q675H spike mutation is the result of parallel evolution because it arose independently in separate evolutionary clades. In silico data show that the Q675H mutation gives rise to a hydrogen-bonds network in the spike polar region. This results in an optimized directionality of arginine residues involved in interaction of spike with the furin binding pocket, thus improving proteolytic exposure of the viral protein. Furin was predicted to have a greater affinity for Q675H than Q675 substrate conformations. As a consequence, Q675H mutation could confer a fitness advantage to SARS-CoV-2 by promoting a more efficient viral entry. Interestingly, here we have shown that Q675H spike mutation is documented in all the VOCs. This finding highlights that VOCs are still evolving to enhance viral fitness and to adapt to the human host. At the same time, it may suggest Q675H spike mutation involvement in SARS-CoV-2 evolution.""","""['Anna Bertelli', ""Pasqualina D'Ursi"", 'Giovanni Campisi', 'Serena Messali', 'Maria Milanesi', 'Marta Giovanetti', 'Massimo Ciccozzi', 'Francesca Caccuri', 'Arnaldo Caruso']""","""[' Section of Microbiology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy.', ' Institute of Technologies in Biomedicine, National Research Council, 20090 Segrate, Italy.', ' Section of Experimental Oncology and Immunology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy.', ' Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.', ' Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology Unit, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, 00128 Rome, Italy.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Viruses""","""['Spread of Gamma (P.1) Sub-Lineages Carrying Spike Mutations Close to the Furin Cleavage Site and Deletions in the N-Terminal Domain Drives Ongoing Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas, Brazil.', 'Natural and Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Rapidly Evolve In Vitro to Higher Infectivity through More Efficient Binding to Heparan Sulfate and Reduced S1/S2 Cleavage.', 'A novel antibody against the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: Effects on proteolytic cleavage and ACE2 binding.', 'V367F Mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD Emerging during the Early Transmission Phase Enhances Viral Infectivity through Increased Human ACE2 Receptor Binding Affinity.', 'D614G Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Increases Syncytium Formation and Virus Titer via Enhanced Furin-Mediated Spike Cleavage.', 'O-Linked Sialoglycans Modulate the Proteolysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Likely Contribute to the Mutational Trajectory in Variants of Concern.', 'SARS-CoV-2 S Mutations: A Lesson from the Viral World to Understand How Human Furin Works.', 'Coordinated evolution at amino acid sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike.', 'Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northwestern Argentina.', 'Spike Mutation Profiles Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Infections in Delta Emerging and Predominant Time Periods in British Columbia, Canada.']"""

An eight-month longitudinal survey was conducted with a large sample of 616 undergraduates from Southwest university. From September 2019 to April 2020, three measurements were conducted. RE was tested before the pandemic (T1), and data of mortality threat, negative affect, and overeating were collected at the middle (T2) and end of (T3) the COVID-19 crisis in China. The correlation results showed that baseline RE was positively associated with mortality threat, negative affect, and overeating at T2 and T3. Moreover, negative affect and mortality threat were positively correlated with overeating. Results from longitudinal mediation showed that baseline RE would positively predict T3 overeating through T2 negative affect, but not T2 mortality threat. This study supports and extends the counterregulatory eating hypothesis that RE positively predicts future overeating, especially through negative emotions. These findings further reveal the core psychological mechanism underlying this positive RE-overeating relation in the context of COVID-19, indicating that the individuals with higher RE could not cope with negative affect adequately, contributing to more overeating.""","""['Yicen Cui', 'Xinyuan Liu', 'Guangcan Xiang', 'Qingqing Li', 'Mingyue Xiao', 'Hong Chen']""","""[' Key Laboratory of Cognition and Personality, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', ' School of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Nutrients""","""['Trait self-control and disinhibited eating in COVID-19: The mediating role of perceived mortality threat and negative affect.', 'Eating Motives and Other Factors Predicting Emotional Overeating during COVID-19 in a Sample of Polish Adults.', 'Social media exposure during COVID-19 lockdowns could lead to emotional overeating via anxiety: The moderating role of neuroticism.', 'Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the coronavirus-19 disease pandemic: a population-based study.', 'Emotional eating in healthy individuals and patients with an eating disorder: evidence from psychometric, experimental and naturalistic studies.']"""

Study participants (320) were assigned into two groups, and consumed either placebo or LC-Plasma tablets (approximately 100 billion cells/day) for 8 weeks. The clinical symptoms of DF were self-recorded through questionnaires, and exposure to DENV was determined by serum antibody and/or DENV antigen tests. No significant differences between groups were observed for exposure to DENV, or the symptomatic ratio. Results obtained showed that participants from the LC-Plasma group reported a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence days of DF-like symptoms, which include fever (p < 0.001), muscle pain (p < 0.005), joint pain (p < 0.001), and pain behind the eyes (p < 0.001), compared to that of the placebo group. Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly (p < 0.05) reduced severity score in the LC-Plasma group when study sites were separately analyzed.

A total of 3404 samples comprising milk and different milk-based food samples were collected from various regions of Serbia from 2017 to 2019. Evaluation of AFM1 exposure was carried out using the deterministic method, whereas risk characterization was evaluated using the margin of exposure (MOE) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Detection rates for AFM1 in milk and milk-based food samples ranged between 2% and 79%, with the highest incidence (79%) and mean level (22.34 ± 0.018 ng kg-1) of AFM1 being detected in pasteurized and UHT milk. According to the three consumption estimates, the values of estimated daily intake (EDI) were higher for toddlers as compared with children aged 3-9 years. Children aged 1-3 years had the highest risk of exposure to AFM1 in milk, with an estimated daily intake of 0.164 and 0.193 ng kg-1 bw day-1 using lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) exposure scenarios, respectively. Such difference could result from the higher consumption to weight in younger children. Based on the estimated daily intake (EDI) found in this study, the risk of AFM1 exposure due to consumption of milk and milk-based food was low since the MOE values obtained were >10,000. In addition, the risk of HCC cases/year/105 individuals of different age groups showed that the value of HCC, using potency estimates of 0.0017 (mean), was maximum (0.00034) in the age group 1-3 years, which indicates no health risk for the evaluated groups.

The Healthy Diets ASAP method protocol was applied to assess the cost and cost differential of current and recommended diets before (in 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (late 2020) for households with a minimum-wage and welfare-only disposable household income, by area of socioeconomic disadvantage, in Greater Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Data were collected between August and October, 2020, from 78 food outlets and compared with data collected in the same locations between May and October, 2019, in an earlier study. The price of most healthy food groups increased significantly during the pandemic-with the exception of vegetables and legumes, which decreased. Conversely, the price of discretionary foods and drinks did not increase during the pandemic. The cost of the current and recommended diets significantly increased throughout this period, but the latter continued to be less expensive than the former. Due to income supplements provided between May and September 2020, the affordability of the recommended diet improved greatly, by 27% and 42%, for households with minimum-wage and welfare-only disposable household income, respectively. This improvement in the affordability of the recommended diet highlights the need to permanently increase welfare support for low-income families to ensure food security.""","""['Amanda J Lee', 'Dori Patay', 'Lisa-Maree Herron', 'Ru Chyi Tan', 'Evelyn Nicoll', 'Bronwyn Fredericks', 'Meron Lewis']""","""[' School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, 266 Herston Rd, St Lucia, QLD 4006, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Nutrients""","""['Affordability of current, and healthy, more equitable, sustainable diets by area of socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness in Queensland: insights into food choice.', 'Healthy Food Prices Increased More Than the Prices of Unhealthy Options during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Concurrent Challenges to the Food System.', 'Cost and Affordability of Healthy, Equitable and Sustainable Diets in Low Socioeconomic Groups in Australia.', 'Cost and affordability of healthy, equitable and more sustainable diets in the Torres Strait Islands.', 'A tale of two cities: the cost, price-differential and affordability of current and healthy diets in Sydney and Canberra, Australia.']"""

In order to achieve a socially recognized ideal appearance, obligatory exercisers might increase dieting behavior when exercise actions are disturbed, thereby placing the individual at risk of eating disorders. The current study mainly examined the relationship between obligatory exercise and eating attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and considered the mediating role of externalized sociocultural attitudes towards appearance between the two. A total of 342 participants (175 females, 167 males) from various regions of China were invited to fill out the questionnaires including the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire, the Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire-3, and the Eating Attitudes Test. In total, 51.5% of the participants presented symptoms of an obligatory exercise behavior. Among them, males, young adults, and the participants with lower BMI had higher OEQ scores, whereas females and young adults had higher EAT-26 scores. Meanwhile, 9.4% of the participants might have had an eating disorder. The OEQ score was positively correlated with the EAT-26 total score as well as SATAQ-3 'Pressures' and 'Information' subscales. In addition, the EAT-26 total score was positively correlated with the SATAQ-3 'Pressures' and 'Information' subscales. Externalized sociocultural attitudes towards appearance served as a mediator between obligatory exercise behavior and eating attitudes, and the mediation effect accounted for 56.82% of the total effect. Obligatory exercise behavior may have an indirect effect on eating attitudes through sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Given the sociocultural information and pressures, in order to maintain or pursue an ideal appearance, many people tend to keep a pathological diet. Thus, forming a positive and healthy social aesthetic orientation is beneficial in helping obligatory exercisers to develop reasonable eating habits.""","""['Hongying Fan', 'Youteng Gan', 'Ruohang Wang', 'Siming Chen', 'Małgorzata Lipowska', 'Jianye Li', 'Keqiang Li', 'Daniel Krokosz', 'Yin Yang', 'Mariusz Lipowski']""","""[' School of Psychology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China.', ' Institute of Psychology, University of Gdańsk, 80-309 Gdańsk, Poland.', ' Faculty of Physical Culture, Gdańsk University of Physical Education and Sport, Górskiego 1, 80-336 Gdańsk, Poland.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Nutrients""","""['The Mediating Role of Eating Attitudes in Sociocultural Attitudes toward the Body in Predicting Obligatory Exercise among Young People: A Polish and Chinese Comparison.', 'The Mediating Effect of Negative Appearance Evaluation on the Relationship Between Eating Attitudes and Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance.', 'Athletic identity and disordered eating in obligatory and non-obligatory runners.', 'Changes in sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, body image, eating attitudes and behaviours, physical activity, and quality of life in students before and during COVID-19 lockdown.', 'Validation of an Italian version of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4-Revised (SATAQ-4R) on non-clinical Italian women and men.', 'Socio-cultural attitudes toward the body as a predictor of motivation for physical activity in young people brought up in Asian and European culture-Chinese-Polish comparison.', 'The Mediating Role of Eating Attitudes in Sociocultural Attitudes toward the Body in Predicting Obligatory Exercise among Young People: A Polish and Chinese Comparison.']"""

As the responsibility for providing a warm lunch for the pupil was transferred to the parents, it was important to understand the parents' experience. The survey was used to gather parents' experiences of school catering allowance received during the pandemic using survey administration software-Google forms; 5166 respondents from different regions of Latvia took part in the survey. The school catering allowance in the form of food packs (83.7%) can be considered successful as over 70% of respondents rated it as positive, giving a rating of 7 (good) or above. Parents from Vidzeme and Latgale had the most positive experience with food packs.

This success can be attributed to the long experiences dealing with natural disasters and communicable diseases. However, with different disastrous characteristics, the disaster management systems for communicable diseases and natural disasters are very different in terms of laws, plans, frameworks, and emergency operations. Taking the response to COVID-19 pandemic as a study subject, we found that disaster management for communicable diseases can be improved through a comparison with natural disasters, and vice versa. First, having wider and longer impacts than natural disasters, the plans and framework for communicable diseases in Taiwan focus more on national and regional scales. Local governments would need more capacity support including budgets and training to conduct investigations and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, for quick response, the emergency operation for communicable diseases was designed to be more flexible than that for natural disasters by giving the commander more authority to adjust to the circumstances. The commanding system requires a more objective consultation group to prevent arbitrary decisions against the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, risk governance is important for communicable diseases as well as for natural disasters. Additional efforts should be made to enhance vulnerability assessment, disaster reduction, and risk communication for shaping responses and policies in an efficient and coordinating way.""","""['Hsiao-Wen Wang', 'Guan-Wei Chen', 'Wei-Lin Lee', 'Shuei-Huei You', 'Chia-Wen Li', 'Jiun-Huei Jang', 'Chjeng-Lun Shieh']""","""[' Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', ' Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Public Health""","""['National Disaster Management System: COVID-19 Case in Korea.', 'Preparedness and Preventive Behaviors for a Pandemic Disaster Caused by COVID-19 in Serbia.', 'Disaster hypertension and cardiovascular events in disaster and COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Reviewing and Reflecting on Nursing During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Global key concepts of civil-military cooperation for disaster management in the COVID-19 pandemic-A qualitative phenomenological scoping review.']"""

Emotional competence, defined as one's ability to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions, has been found linked with mental health problems (e.g., depression and anxiety) in previous studies. However, there is limited knowledge about the direction of the association between these factors among populations exposed to COVID-19. This study examined the possible mediation relationships between depression, anxiety, emotional competence, and COVID-19 exposure among Chinese adolescents. Methods: Responses from 7,958 Chinese adolescents who had previously taken part in a two-wave study before (December 23, 2019-January 13, 2020) and during COVID-19 (June 16, 2020-July 8, 2020) were analyzed (51.67% males, mean age = 11.74, SD = 2.15). Structural equation modeling with three covariates (i.e., age, gender, and ethnicity) was used to test the longitudinal mediation relationships between COVID-19 exposure and depression, anxiety via emotional competence. Results: Results indicated that the prevalence of depression (38.67 to 36.74%) and anxiety (13.02 to 12.77%) decreased from Time 1 to Time 2. The T2 emotional competence significantly mediated the relationship between T2 COVID-19 exposure and T2 anxiety (indirect effect [95% CI] = 0.011 [0.004-0.019], p < 0.05). T2 emotional competence also significantly mediated the relationship between T2 COVID-19 exposure and T2 depression (indirect effect [95% CI] = 0.013 [0.005-0.022], p < 0.05). The results indicated that T2 emotional competence had a significant and negative influence on T2 anxiety (β = -0.266, SE = 0.005, p < 0.001), and T2 depression (β = -0.326, SE = 0.029, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This longitudinal research study demonstrated the crucial role of emotional competence in influencing the severity of long-term mental health problems, and suggested that emotional competence interventions can be conducted to improve mental well-being among Chinese adolescents exposed to COVID-19.""","""['Wei Shi', 'Guangzhe Frank Yuan', 'Brian J Hall', 'Xiaoli Liu', 'Ya Su', 'Li Zhao', 'Peng Jia']""","""[' Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction (IDMR), Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ' Department of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Macau, Macau SAR, China.', ' Global and Community Mental Health Research Group, New York University, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', ' Office of Humanities and Social Sciences Administration, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ' Department of Sociology, Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, United States.', ' Department of Health Policy and Management, West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ' Health Emergency Management Research Center.

This study examined social, behavioral, and medical correlates of social isolation among community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and stratified findings to explore unique differences in two typically neglected populations, African American and Hispanic older adults. Methods: Working with community-based organizations and senior living centers, the research team administered a survey to older adults 55 years of age and older (n = 575). The survey assessed COVID-19 prevention behaviors, medical conditions, and lived experiences, including feelings of social isolation, in the target population. Responses to a previously validated social isolation question informed a dichotomous social isolation dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, unmet caregiving needs, and COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Results from the regression model were stratified by race/ethnicity to examine correlates of social isolation in African American and Hispanic older adults, separately. Results: Overall, female sex and a higher level of education were also positively associated with social isolation (OR = 2.46, p = 0.04; OR = 5.49, p = 0.02) while having insurance exhibited an inverse relationship (OR = 0.25, p = 0.03). Unmet caregiving needs were strongly associated with social isolation (OR = 6.41, p < 0.001) as was having any chronic conditions (OR = 2.99, p = 0.02). Diabetes was the single strongest chronic condition predictor of social isolation. Among minority older adults, a different pattern emerged. For Hispanic older adults, language, unmet caregiving needs, and social distancing were strongly associated with social isolation; while unmet caregiving needs, having 1+ chronic conditions and adhering to social distancing guidelines were significant predictors in African American older adults. Conclusion: These findings suggest that social isolation affects older adults in a myriad of ways and support the need for culturally sensitive initiatives to mitigate the effect of social isolation in these vulnerable populations.""","""['Omolola E Adepoju', 'Minji Chae', 'LeChauncy Woodard', 'Kendra L Smith', 'Luz Herrera', 'Daikwon Han', 'Daniel L Howard', 'Jessica Dobbins', 'Marcia Ory']""","""[' Department of Health Systems and Population Health Sciences, University of Houston College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', ' Humana Integrated Health System Sciences Institute, University of Houston College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', ' Texas A&M University School of Law, Fort Worth, TX, United States.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Texas A&M School of Public Health, College Station, TX, United States.', ' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, United States.', ' Office of Health Affairs and Advocacy, Humana Inc., Louisville, KY, United States.', ' Center for Population Health and Aging, Texas A&M School of Public Health, College Station, TX, United States.', ' Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Texas A&M School of Public Health, College Station, TX, United States.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Public Health""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'Social Isolation and Loneliness Among San Francisco Bay Area Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place Orders.', 'Factors associated with social isolation and loneliness in community-dwelling older adults during pandemic times: a cross-sectional study.', ""Conversations in Times of Isolation: Exploring Rural-Dwelling Older Adults' Experiences of Isolation and Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Manitoba, Canada."", 'Student-senior isolation prevention partnership: a Canada-wide programme to mitigate social exclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Race-Ethnicity and Depressive Symptoms Among U.S. Older Adults in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Uncovering the Counterbalancing Mechanisms.', 'How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Impacted Daily Life?

Results Pre-COVID-19 (1/1/2019-3/2/2020), EMS transported patients were predominately female (50.6%), 80+ years old (31.6%), and Marin County residents (68.0%). During COVID-19 (3/3/2020-3/1/2021), EMS transported patients were predominately male (52.7%), 35-64 years old (29.8%), and Marin County residents (70.4%).

Results: We find procyclical oscillations in mortality (i.e., higher mortality with higher GDP per capita) for total mortality, female population, populations of 0-9 and 45+ years, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, respiratory infections and road traffic injuries. Homicides appear countercyclical, with higher levels at lower GDP per capita. Conclusions: Our results reveal large heterogeneity, but in our sample of cities, for specific population groups and causes of death, mortality oscillates procyclically, increasing when GDP per capita increases. In contrast we find few instances of countercyclical mortality.""","""['Carlos Marcelo Leveau', 'José A Tapia Granados', 'Maria Izabel Dos Santos', 'Marianela Castillo-Riquelme', 'Marcio Alazraqui']""","""[' Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', ' Instituto de Producción, Economía y Trabajo (IPET), Universidad Nacional de Lanús, Remedios de Escalada, Argentina.', ' Department of Politics, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', ' Centro de Integração de Dados e Conhecimentos para a Saúde (CIDACS), Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador de Bahía, Brazil.', ' Escuela de Salud Pública, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', ' Instituto de Salud Colectiva, Universidad Nacional de Lanús, Remedios de Escalada, Argentina.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Int J Public Health""","""['Urban landscape and street-design factors associated with road-traffic mortality in Latin America between 2010 and 2016 (SALURBAL): an ecological study.', 'Building a Data Platform for Cross-Country Urban Health Studies: the SALURBAL Study.', 'Multicity study of air pollution and mortality in Latin America (the ESCALA study).', 'Infant and child mortality in Latin America.', 'Prevalence of Anemia in Latin America and the Caribbean.', 'Global, Regional, and National Burden of Road Injuries from 1990 to 2019.']"""

The understanding of the impact of SVR on fibrosis stage is limited.  Objectives:   To determine the effect of treatment with the DAAs on long-term liver fibrosis stages, as determined by shear-wave elastography (SWE) or FibroTest.  Methods:   Fibrosis stage was determined at baseline and at 6-month intervals after end of treatment (EOT), using two-dimensional SWE or FibroTest©; APRI and FIB-4 scores.  Results:   The study comprised 133 SVR12 patients. After a median follow-up of 15 months (range 6-33), liver fibrosis stage decreased by at least 1 stage in 75/133 patients (56%). Cirrhosis reversal was observed in 24/82 (29%). Repeated median liver stiffness SWE values in cirrhotic patients were 15.1 kPa at baseline (range 10.5-100), 13.4 kPa (range 5.5-51) at 6 months, and 11.4 kPa (range 6.1-35.8) at 12 months after EOT, P = 0.01. During the second year after EOT, no statistically significant differences in liver fibrosis stage in 12, 18, and 24 months were found. Splenomegaly was the only significant negative predictor of liver fibrosis regression during all time points of repetitive noninvasive assessment.  Conclusions:   Following successful DAA treatment, the majority of our HCV patients with advanced fibrosis demonstrated significant improvement, as assessed by non-invasive methods. Advanced fibrosis stage was a negative predictor of fibrosis regression.

Thus, oncology departments have had to implement a wide array of prevention measures.  Objectives:   To address issues associated with cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the implementation of measures aimed at containment of COVID-19 diffusion while allowing continuation of quality cancer care.  Methods:   A national survey among oncology departments in Israel was conducted between 12 April 2020 and 14 April 2020. Eighteen heads of hospital-based oncology departments completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their institute's preparedness for treatment of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Results:   In this national survey, prevention measures against COVID-19 spread were taken prior to patients' arrival and at arrival or while staying in the departments. Most participants (78-89%) reported using a quick triage of patients and caregivers prior to their entrance to the oncology units, limiting the entrance of caregivers, and reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic. Switching to oral therapies rather than intravenous ones when possible was considered by 82% and shortage in personal protective equipment was reported by five (28%) heads of oncology departments. Some differences between large and small/medium sized medical centers were observed regarding issues related to COVID-19 containment measures and changes in treatment.

Herein, we further characterized the protection efficacy of ARCoV in nonhuman primates and the long-term stability under normal refrigerator temperature. Intramuscular immunization of two doses of ARCoV elicited robust neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular response against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques. More importantly, ARCoV vaccination in macaques significantly protected animals from acute lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2, and viral replication in lungs and secretion in nasal swabs were completely cleared in all animals immunized with low or high doses of ARCoV. No evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection was observed throughout the study. Finally, extensive stability assays showed that ARCoV can be stored at 2-8 °C for at least 6 months without decrease of immunogenicity.

Methods:   Epidemiological data and fecal specimens were collected between January 2011 and December 2018 from 4911 children < 5 years of age with diarrhea in three districts of Beijing. From 2011 to 2013, One-Step Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect noroviruses, and from January 2014 to December 2018, norovirus GI and GII were screened using duplex quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). One-Step RT-PCR and RT-seminested PCR were performed to amplify the RNA-dependent polymerase and capsid genes of noroviruses in positive sample. Amplified products were sequenced directly; norovirus was typed using the online Norovirus Genotyping Tool v2.0 and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA-X.  Results:   From 2011 to 2018, noroviruses were detected in 16.5% of specimens from children with diarrhea. The highest prevalence was observed in children aged 12 to 23 months (22.4%, 319/1421), followed by children aged 6 to 11 months (17.6%, 253/1441). The highest prevalence of norovirus infections occurred in autumn followed by winter, spring, and summer. From 2011 to 2018, the most prevalent dual types (genotype and polymerase type) were GII.4 Sydney[P31] (51.6%, 239/463), followed by GII.3[P12] (24.0%, 111/463), GII.4 2006b[P4 2006b] (7.3%, 34/463), GII.2[P16] (5.0%, 23/463), GII.17[P17] (2.6%, 12/463) and GII.6[P7] (2.6%, 12/463). GII.4 2006b[P4 2006b] predominated in 2011 and 2012. GII.4 Sydney[P31] predominated from 2013 to 2018.

The project has a strong focus on electronic health (eHealth) but covers other areas of innovation as well. The project has been designed as an ethnography to prelude a realist evaluation, asking the question under what conditions can local health and care services take responsibility for designing and implementing new service models that meet local needs? The project had already engaged with several health care practitioners and research students based in Canada, Sweden, Australia, and the United States. Our attention is particularly on rural communities with fewer than 5,000 residents and which are relatively isolated from larger service centres. Between March and September 2020, the project team undertook ethnographic and auto-ethnographic research in their own communities to investigate what the service model responses to the pandemic were, and the extent to which local service managers were able to customize their responses to suit the needs of their communities. An initial program theory drawn from the extant literature suggested that ""successful"" response to the pandemic would depend on a level of local autonomy, ""absorptive capacity,*"" strong service-community connections, an ""anti-fragile†"" approach to implementing change, and a realistic recognition of the historical barriers to implementing eHealth and other innovations in these types of rural communities. The field research in 2020 has refined the theory by focusing even more attention on absorptive capacity and community connections, and by suggesting that some level of ignorance of the barriers to innovation may be beneficial. The research also emphasized the role and power of external actors to the community which had not been well-explored in the literature. This paper will summarize both what the field research revealed about the capacity to respond well to the COVID-19 challenge and highlight the gaps in innovative strategies at a managerial level required for rapid response to system stress. *Absorptive Capacity is defined as the ability of an organization (community, clinic, hospital) to adapt to change. Organizations with flexible capacity can incorporate change in a productive fashion, while those with rigid capacity take longer to adapt, and may do so inappropriately. †Antifragility is defined as an entities' ability to gain stability through stress. Biological examples include building muscle through consistent use, and bones becoming stronger through subtle stress.

Objectives:   To explore context-specific sociodemographic heterogeneities in order to understand the differential impacts of COVID-19.  Methods:   Descriptive epidemiological COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality data were drawn from daily hospital surveillance data, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) update reports (6 March 2020 - 24 January 2021) and the Eastern Cape Daily Epidemiological Report (as of 24 March 2021). We examined hospitalisations and mortality by sociodemographics (age using 10-year age bands, sex and race) using absolute numbers, proportions and ratios. The data are presented using tables received from the NICD, and charts were created to show trends and patterns. Mortality rates (per 100 000 population) were calculated using population estimates as a denominator for standardisation. Associations were determined through relative risks (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values &lt;0.001.  Results:   Black African females had a significantly higher rate of hospitalisation (8.7% (95% CI 8.5 - 8.9)) compared with coloureds, Indians and whites (6.7% (95% CI 6.0 - 7.4), 6.3% (95% CI 5.5 - 7.2) and 4% (95% CI 3.5 - 4.5), respectively). Similarly, black African females had the highest hospitalisation rates at a younger age category of 30 - 39 years (16.1%) compared with other race groups. Whites were hospitalised at older ages than other races, with a median age of 63 years. Black Africans were hospitalised at younger ages than other race groups, with a median age of 52 years. Whites were significantly more likely to die at older ages compared with black Africans (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.06 - 1.08) or coloureds (RR 1.44; 95% CI 1.33 - 1.54); a similar pattern was found between Indians and whites (RR 1.59; 95% CI 1.47 - 1.73). Women died at older ages than men, although they were admitted to hospital at younger ages. Among black Africans and coloureds, females (50.9 deaths per 100 000 and 37 per 100 000, respectively) had a higher COVID-19 death rate than males (41.2 per 100 000 and 41.5 per 100 000, respectively). However, among Indians and whites, males had higher rates of deaths than females. The ratio of deaths to hospitalisations by race and gender increased with increasing age. In each age group, this ratio was highest among black Africans and lowest among whites.  Conclusions:   The study revealed the heterogeneous nature of COVID-19 impacts in SA. Existing socioeconomic inequalities appear to shape COVID-19 impacts, with a disproportionate effect on black Africans and marginalised and low socioeconomic groups. These differential impacts call for considered attention to mitigating the health disparities among black Africans.""","""['N Phaswana-Mafuya', 'O Shisana', 'W Jassat', 'S D Baral', 'Keletso Makofane', 'E Phalane', 'Khangelani Zuma', 'N Zungu', 'Martha Chadyiwa']""","""[' Department of Environmental Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Johannesburg, South Africa. refilwep@uj.ac.za.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""S Afr Med J""","""['Racial or Ethnic Health Disparities among Older Adults in Four Population Groups in South Africa.', 'Differences among the coloured, white, black, and other South African populations in smoking-attributed mortality at ages 35-74 years: a case-control study of 481,640 deaths.', 'Infant mortality rate inequalities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Health Disparities of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Texas, March-July 2020.', 'Heterogeneity in COVID-19 infection among older persons in South Africa: Evidence from national surveillance data.']"""

The level of VT in a specific location has epidemiological implications in terms of viral maintenance in vectors. Identification of the circulating DENV serotypes in both patients and Aedes mosquito larvae in an area may be useful for the early detection of outbreaks. We report here the results of a prospective descriptive study that was conducted to detect the levels of VT in Aedes mosquito larvae and circulating DENV serotypes in patients and Aedes mosquito larvae from December 2015 to March 2017 in an area of Sri Lanka at high risk for dengue.  Methods:   A total of 200 patients with clinically suspected dengue who had been admitted to a tertiary care hospital during a dengue outbreak (3 study periods: December 2015-January 2016, June-August 2016, December 2016-January 2017) and in the inter-outbreak periods (February-May 2016 and September-November 2016) were investigated. Blood samples were drawn from the study participants to test for DENV. The houses of the study participants were visited within 7 days of admission to the hospital, and Aedes larvae were also collected within a radius of 400 m from the houses. The larvae were separately identified to species and then pooled according to each patient's identification number. Patients' sera and the Aedes larvae were tested to identify the infecting DENV serotypes using a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method. Levels of VT in Aedes mosquito larvae were also identified.  Results:   All four DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) were identified in the study area. In the early part of the study (December 2015-February 2016), DENV-3 was predominant and from April 2016 to March 2017, DENV-2 became the most predominant type. Four cases of DENV co-infections were noted during the study period in patients. Interestingly, all four DENV serotypes were detected in Aedes albopictus larvae, which was the prominent immature vectorial form identified throughout the study period in the area, showing 9.8% VT of DENV. With the exception of DENV-4, the other three DENV serotypes were identified in Aedes aegypti larvae with a VT of 8.1%.  Conclusion:   Comparatively high rates of VT of DENV was detected in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti larvae.

However, little is known about the methodology that CGs follow. We conducted a national survey of methods used by Chinese CG developers for CG development, adaptation, and updating.  Methods:   We used a previously piloted questionnaire based on methodologies of CG development, adaptation, and updating, which was distributed during September-November 2020 to 114 organizations identified from published Chinese CGs (searched 2017-2020), recommended by Chinese CG developers, and recommended by clinical discipline experts.  Results:   We collected 48 completed questionnaires (42.1% response). Most organizations developed CGs based on scientific evidence (89.6%), existing CGs (75%), or expert experience and opinion (64.6%). Only a few organizations had a specific CG development division (6.3%), a CG monitoring plan (on clinicians 33.3%; on patients 18.8%), funding (33.3%), or a conflict-of-interest (COI) management policy (23.4%). Thirty (62.5%) organizations reported using a CG development methodology handbook, from international organizations (14/30, 46.7%), methodology or evaluation resources (3/30, 10.0%), expert experience and opinion (3/30, 10.0%), or in-house handbooks (3/30, 10.0%). One organization followed a published adaptation methodology. Thirty-eight organizations (88.4%) reported de novo CG development: 21 (55.3%) formed a CG working group, and 29 (76.3%) evaluated the quality of evidence (21 [72.4%] using a methodological tool). Nineteen organizations (52.8%) reported CG adaptation: three (31.6%) had an adaptation working group, and 12 (63.2%) evaluated the quality of source CGs (2 (16.7%) using the AGREE II instrument). Thirty-three organizations (68.8%) updated their CGs, seven (17.5%) using a formal updating process.  Conclusions:   Our study describes how CGs are developed in a middle-income country like China.

This study was designed to determine the effects of pandemic movement restriction policies on the 24-hour movement behavior (24-HMB) of children, and whether any alterations are reflected in worsening physical fitness outcomes determined via direct testing. Methods: A two-phase, repeated-measures study with matched controls was conducted. Phase One: N = 62 schoolchildren (N = 31 female) completed self-assessment questionnaires on 24-HMB in October 2018 (pre-pandemic) and again in April 2020, at the height of movement restrictions enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic first wave. Phase Two: physical fitness of the original N = 62 children were determined directly pre- and post-isolation using an eight-component standardized fitness test battery and compared to N = 62 control children who were matched for age, sex, school region, and fitness centile scores. Results: During lockdown (total duration: 63 days), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) decreased by ~46 min per day, screen time demonstrated a significant interaction effect, such that kids reported spending less recreational screen time on weekends during lockdown compared to no restriction, and sleep duration was consistently lower (95% CI: -104.1 to -45.5 min, p < 0.001). No interaction effect was present for direct fitness indicators, including: hand tapping (reaction time), standing broad jump, polygon backward obstacle course (coordination), sit-ups, stand-and-reach, bent-arm hang, 60-m, and 600-m run (p ≥ 0.05) although significant main effects are noted for both sexes. Conclusion: Initial changes in 24-HMB did not translate to reductions in physical fitness per se, likely due to the high initial fitness levels of the children. Further work is needed to confirm whether longer or repeated movement restrictions exacerbate initial negative 24-HMB trends, especially for children who are less fit when restrictions are initiated, prolonged, or repeated.""","""['Shawnda A Morrison', 'Kaja Meh', 'Vedrana Sember', 'Gregor Starc', 'Gregor Jurak']""","""[' Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Public Health""","""['Association between 24-hour movement guidelines and physical fitness in children.', 'Global effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep among 3- to 5-year-old children: a longitudinal study of 14 countries.', '24-h movement behaviours in Spanish youth before and after 1-year into the covid-19 pandemic and its relationship to academic performance.', 'Changes in Active Behaviours, Physical Activity, Sedentary Time, and Physical Fitness in Chilean Parents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Study.', ""Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on elementary schoolers' physical activity, sleep, screen time and diet: A quasi-experimental interrupted time series study."", 'Physical fitness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of annual national physical fitness surveillance among 16,647,699 Japanese children and adolescents between 2013 and 2021.', 'Assessment of Changes in Child and Adolescent Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Ringing the bell for quality P.E.: What are the realities of remote physical education?', 'The Association Between Environmental and Social Factors and Myopia: A Review of Evidence From COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Motor Development of Schoolchildren in Rural and Urban Environments.']"""

This study focuses on mental health and sentiment validations caused by the global lockdowns across the countries, resulting in a mental disability among individuals. This paper discusses a technique for identifying the mental state of an individual by sentiment analysis of feelings such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness caused by isolation and pauses to the normal chains of operations in daily life. The research uses a Neural Network (NN) to resolve and extract patterns and validate threshold trained datasets for decision making.

The development of vaccines with high immunogenicity and safety is crucial for controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic and preventing further illness and fatalities. Here, we report the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, Nanocovax, based on recombinant protein production of the extracellular (soluble) portion of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that Nanocovax induced high levels of S protein-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in three animal models: BALB/c mouse, Syrian hamster, and a non-human primate (Macaca leonina).

Using data from 650 European regions in 14 countries, I first show that winter school holidays in late February/early March 2020 (weeks 8, 9 and 10) led to large regional outbreaks of Covid-19 in the spring with the spread being 60% and up-to over 90% higher compared to regions with earlier school holidays. While the impact of these initial large outbreaks fades away over the summer months, it systematically reappears from the fall as regions with school holidays in weeks 8, 9 and 10 had 30-70% higher spread. This suggests that following a large outbreak, there is a strong element of underlying (latent) regional persistence of Covid-19. The strong degree of persistence highlights the long-term benefits of effective (initial) containment policies, as once a large outbreak has occurred, Covid-19 persists. This result emphasizes the need for vaccinations against Covid-19 in regions that have recently experienced large outbreaks but are well below herd-immunity, to avoid a new surge of cases.""","""['Björn Thor Arnarson']""","""[' Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. bta@econ.ku.dk.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Sci Rep""","""['SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in educational settings: a prospective, cross-sectional analysis of infection clusters and outbreaks in England.', 'Impact of winter holiday and government responses on mortality in Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Untangling introductions and persistence in COVID-19 resurgence in Europe.', 'Multiple Variants of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Outbreak After Spring Break - Chicago, Illinois, March-May 2021.', 'Non-pharmacological measures implemented in the setting of long-term care facilities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences: a rapid review.', 'COVID-19 in people aged 18-64 in Sweden in the first year of the pandemic: Key factors for severe disease and death.', 'Social Contacts and Transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada.']"""

Smartphone use belongs to one's daily routine, but can negatively impact physical and mental health, performance, and relationships if used excessively. The present study aimed to investigate potential correlates of problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and the mechanisms underlying its development. Data of 516 smartphone users from Germany (Mage = 31.91, SDage = 12.96) were assessed via online surveys in April and May 2021. PSU severity was significantly negatively associated with sense of control. In contrast, it was significantly positively linked to fear of missing out (FoMO), repetitive negative thinking (RNT), and daily time spent on smartphone use. In a moderated mediation analysis, the negative relationship between sense of control and PSU severity was significantly mediated by FoMO. RNT significantly moderated the positive association between FoMO and PSU severity. Specifically, the higher the RNT, the stronger the relationship between FoMO and PSU. The present findings disclose potential mechanisms that could contribute to PSU.

To test whether distortions in the age distribution of deaths can track pandemic activity. Methods. We compared weekly distributions of all-cause deaths by age during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States from March to December 2020 with corresponding prepandemic weekly baseline distributions derived from data for 2015 to 2019. We measured distortions via Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and χ2 goodness-of-fit statistics as well as deaths among individuals aged 65 years or older as a percentage of total deaths (PERC65+). We computed bivariate correlations between these measures and the number of recorded COVID-19 deaths for the corresponding weeks. Results. Elevated COVID-19-associated fatalities were accompanied by greater distortions in the age structure of mortality. Distortions in the age distribution of weekly US COVID-19 deaths in 2020 relative to earlier years were highly correlated with COVID fatalities (K-S: r = 0.71, P < .001; χ2: r = 0.90, P < .001; PERC65+: r = 0.85, P < .001). Conclusions. A population-representative sample of age-at-death data can serve as a useful means of pandemic activity surveillance when precise cause-of-death data are incomplete, inaccurate, or unavailable, as is often the case in low-resource environments.

The specific aim of our study was to provide insights into the effect of timetabling decisions on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of undergraduate engineering students.  Methods:   We developed an agent-based modelling simulation that used a Canadian first-year undergraduate engineering program with an enrolment of 180 students in 5 courses of 12.7 weeks in length. Each course involved 150 minutes of lectures and 110 minutes of tutorials or laboratories per week. We considered several online and in-person timetabling scenarios with different scheduling frequencies and section sizes, in combination with surveillance and testing interventions. The study was conducted from May 1 to Aug. 31, 2021.  Results:   When timetabling interventions were applied, we found a reduction in the mean number of students who were infected and that a containment of widespread outbreaks could be achieved. Timetables with online lectures and small (1/6 class capacity) tutorial or laboratory sections reduced the mean number of students who were infected by 83% and reduced the risk of large outbreaks that occurred with in-person lectures. We also found that spread of SARS-CoV-2 was less sensitive to class size than to contact frequency when a biweekly timetable was implemented (i.e., alternating online and in-person sections on a biweekly basis). Including a contact-tracing policy and randomized testing to the timetabling interventions helped to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 further. Vaccination coverage had the largest effect on reducing the number of students who were infected.  Interpretation:   Our modelling showed that by taking advantage of timetabling opportunities and applying appropriate interventions (contact tracing, randomized testing and vaccination), SARS-CoV-2 infections may be averted and disruptions (case isolations) reduced. However, given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, transitions from online to in-person classes should proceed cautiously from small biweekly classes, for example, to manage risk.""","""['Robert W Brennan', 'Nancy Nelson', 'Robyn Paul']""","""[' Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (Brennan, Paul), University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta.; Department of Engineering and Information Technology (Nelson), Conestoga University, Cambridge, Ont. rbrennan@ucalgary.ca.', ' Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (Brennan, Paul), University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta.; Department of Engineering and Information Technology (Nelson), Conestoga University, Cambridge, Ont.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""CMAJ Open""","""['COVID-19 cluster size and transmission rates in schools from crowdsourced case reports.', 'Surveillance-based informative testing for detection and containment of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on a public university campus: an observational and modelling study.', 'Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.', 'Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four different strategies for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the general population (CoV-Surv Study): a structured summary of a study protocol for a cluster-randomised, two-factorial controlled trial.', 'Assessment of a COVID-19 Control Plan on an Urban University Campus During a Second Wave of the Pandemic.', 'Using simulation modelling and systems science to help contain COVID-19: A systematic review.']"""

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic within the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) by comparing total volumes of screening mammographic examinations and volumes of screening mammographic examinations with abnormal results before and during the pandemic, and to assess backlogs on the basis of adherence to the prioritization framework.  Methods:   A descriptive study was conducted among women aged 50 to 74 years at average risk and women aged 30 to 69 years at high risk, who participated in the OBSP. Percentage change was calculated by comparing observed monthly volumes of mammographic examinations from March 2020 to March 2021 with 2019 volumes and proportions by risk group. We plotted estimates of backlog volumes of mammographic examinations by risk group, comparing pandemic with prepandemic screening practices. Volumes of mammographic examinations with abnormal results were plotted by risk group.  Results:   Volumes of mammographic examinations in the OBSP showed the largest declines in April and May 2020 (> 99% decrease) and returned to prepandemic levels as of March 2021, with an accumulated backlog of 340 876 examinations. As of March 2021, prioritization had reduced the backlog volumes of screens for participants at high risk for breast cancer by 96.5% (186 v. 5469 expected) and annual rescreens for participants at average risk for breast cancer by 13.5% (62 432 v. 72 202 expected); there was a minimal decline for initial screens. Conversely, the backlog increased by 7.6% for biennial rescreens (221 674 v. 206 079 expected). More than half (59.4%) of mammographic examinations with abnormal results were for participants in the higher risk groups.

With test procedures and vaccines becoming available at scale, nursing homes might relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections. By control we mean that each index case infects less than one other person on average. Here, we develop an agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 calibrated to Austrian nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends critically on test turnover time (time until test result), the detection threshold of tests and mitigation testing frequencies. Under realistic conditions and in absence of vaccinations, we find that mitigation testing of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks if tests have low turnover times and detection thresholds. If vaccines that are 60% effective against high viral load and transmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the residents are vaccinated, even without mitigation testing and if residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures, regular testing and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern.""","""['Jana Lasser', 'Johannes Zuber', 'Johannes Sorger', 'Elma Dervic', 'Katharina Ledebur', 'Simon David Lindner', 'Elisabeth Klager', 'Maria Kletečka-Pulker', 'Harald Willschke', 'Katrin Stangl', 'Sarah Stadtmann', 'Christian Haslinger', 'Peter Klimek', 'Thomas Wochele-Thoma']""","""[' Institute for Interactive Systems and Data Science, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Steierermark, Austria.', ' Institute for Interactive Systems and Data Science, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria.', ' Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Wien, Austria.', ' Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Wien, Austria.', ' Medical University Vienna, Section for Science of Complex Systems, Wien, Austria.', ' Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Patient Safety, Vienna, Austria.', ' University Vienna, Institut für Ethik und Recht in der Medizin, Wien, Austria.', ' Caritas Erzdiözese Wien, Wien, Austria.', ' Hygienefachkraft-unlimited, Wien, Austria.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""J R Soc Interface""","""['Vaccine effectiveness of the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of long-term care facilities in England (VIVALDI): a prospective cohort study.', 'Managing the Impact of COVID-19 in Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities: An Update.', 'Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant - National Healthcare Safety Network, March 1-August 1, 2021.', 'Modelling of hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 point of care tests for routine testing in residential care homes: rapid cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Protecting Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities From COVID-19: A Rapid Review of International Evidence.', 'Exploring the Role of Industry 4.0 and Simulation as a Solution to the COVID-19 Outbreak: a Literature Review.', 'Employer impact on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among nursing and social care employees in Austria.', 'Using simulation modelling and systems science to help contain COVID-19: A systematic review.', 'Testing and vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes: an agent-based approach.', 'Assessment of the Effectiveness of Omicron Transmission Mitigation Strategies for European Universities Using an Agent-Based Network Model.']"""

However, there is no adequate evidence in Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Hence, this study aims to estimate lifetime survival and predictors of mortality among TB with HIV co-infected children after test and treat strategies launched in Northwest Ethiopia Hospitals, 2021.  Methods:   Institution-based historical follow-up study was conducted in Northwest Ethiopia Hospitals among 227 Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus co-infected children from March 1, 2014, to January 12, 2021. The data were entered into Epi info-7 and then exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. The log-rank test was used to estimate the curve difference of the predictor variables. Bivariable cox-proportional hazard models were employed for each predictor variable. Additionally, those variables having a p-value < 0.25 in bivariate analysis were fitted into a multivariable cox-proportional hazards model. P-value < 0.05 was used to declare significance associated with the dependent variable.  Results:   From a total of 227 TB and HIV co-infected children, 39 died during the follow-up period. The overall mortality rate was 3.7 (95% CI (confidence interval): 2.9-4.7) per 100 person-years with a total of 1063.2-year observations. Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) non-users [Adjusted Hazarded Ratio (AHR) = 3.8 (95% CI: 1.64-8.86)], presence of treatment failure [AHR = 3.0 (95% CI: 1.14-78.17)], and Cluster of differentiation 4(CD4) count below threshold [AHR = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.21-6.45)] were significant predictors of mortality.  Conclusion:   In this study, the mortality rate among TB and HIV co-infected children was found to be very high. The risk of mortality among TB and HIV co-infected children was associated with treatment failure, CD4 count below the threshold, and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy non-users.

In response, this article reports a 5-week qualitative study with 24 emerging adults (average age: 20) living in a South African township. Using digital diaries and repeated individual interviews, young people shared their lived experiences of later (i.e., month 4 and 7) lockdown-related challenges (i.e., contagion fears; livelihood threats; lives-on-hold) and how they managed these challenges. An inductive thematic analysis showed that personal and collective compliance, generous ways-of-being, and tolerance-facilitators enabled emerging adult resilience to said challenges. Importantly, these resilience-enablers drew on resources associated with multiple systems and reflected the situational and cultural context of the township in question.

However, a significant proportion of patients initially manifested non-respiratory symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, and diarrhea. Here, we compared the different characteristics and outcomes between the patients with respiratory symptoms and non-respiratory symptoms at illness onset. The patients admitted to the respiratory departments from eight hospitals in Hunan and Guangxi Province with nucleic acid-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited. Epidemiological information, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiological characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcomes data were recorded and analyzed. The median age of the recruited 541 subjects was 43 years (IQR, 33-55). Of the 541 subjects, 404 (74.5%) subjects had initial symptom that were respiratory, while 137 (25.5%) subjects had non-respiratory symptoms. Respiratory COVID-19 subjects had more secondary bacterial infections (8.7% vs 0.0%, P < 0.001), needed the intensive care unit more (9.7% vs 2.2%, P = 0.005), non-invasive ventilation more (7.2% vs 1.5%, P = 0.004), developed ARDS more (11.4% vs 2.2%, P = 0.001) and needed longer time to recover (18.5 vs 16.7 days, P = 0.003) compared to predominately non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects. The multivariate model showed that age (OR = 1.04, P = 0.01), dyspnea (OR = 4.91, P < 0.001) and secondary bacterial infection (OR = 19.8, P < 0.001) were independently associated with development of ARDS among COVID-19 patients. We identify COVID-19 subjects with dyspnea at disease onset who have a worse prognosis.

We evaluated the progression risk factors of primary FSGS to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESKD with a predictive model including clinical and histological predictors.  Methods:   201 patients with primary FSGS (59% male, mean age: 38 ± 15 years), were studied. Time-dependent Cox model and C statistics were used for the predictive model. Interaction and correlation between independent variables were estimated.  Results:   During 55 ± 27 months of follow-up, 82 patients (41%) developed CKD (46) or ESKD (36) patients. In adjusted model, 1 unit of higher serum creatinine (SCr) at baseline (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.70) and 1% increase in glomeruli with segmental glomerulosclerosis (SGS) (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.04) or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.05) increased the risk of CKD/ESKD. In adjusted model, higher baseline proteinuria and collapsing variant were not associated with risk of CKD/ESKD. By adding SGS and IF/TA scores to baseline SCr in the model, discrimination by C statistics was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77 to 0.90). Median renal survival was 3.1 years (95% CI: 2.2 to 4.1 years) in patients with highest risk score (baseline eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m2 + IF/TA/SGS > 50%), and 8.1 years (95% CI: 7.7 to 8.6 years).in those with lowest score (baseline eGFR > 75 mL/ min/1.73m2 + IF/TA/SGS < 5%).  Conclusion:   In primary FSGS, higher baseline SCr, increased SGS and IF/TA, but not baseline proteinuria and collapsing pathology, were the predictors for CKD/ESKD. These findings indicated the importance of timely detection and referral in prognosis of primary FSGS.

The effectiveness of this procedure for infection surveillance and malaria control may be limited by a relatively high parasitaemia detection threshold. Persons with microscopically undetectable infections may go untreated, contributing to ongoing transmission to mosquito vectors. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and determinants of undiagnosed submicroscopic P. falciparum infections in a rural area of western Kenya.  Methods:   A health facility-based survey was conducted, and 367 patients seeking treatment for symptoms consistent with uncomplicated malaria in Homa Bay County were enrolled. The frequency of submicroscopic P. falciparum infection was measured by comparing the prevalence of infection based on light microscopic inspection of thick blood smears versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting P. falciparum 18S rRNA gene. Long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) use, participation in nocturnal outdoor activities, and gender were considered as potential determinants of submicroscopic infections.  Results:   Microscopic inspection of blood smears was positive for asexual P. falciparum parasites in 14.7% (54/367) of cases. All of these samples were confirmed by RT-PCR. 35.8% (112/313) of blood smear negative cases were positive by RT-PCR, i.e., submicroscopic infection, resulting in an overall prevalence by RT-PCR alone of 45.2% compared to 14.7% for blood smear alone. Females had a higher prevalence of submicroscopic infections (35.6% or 72 out of 202 individuals, 95% CI 28.9-42.3) compared to males (24.2%, 40 of 165 individuals, 95% CI 17.6-30.8). The risk of submicroscopic infections in LLIN users was about half that of non-LLIN users (OR = 0.59). There was no difference in the prevalence of submicroscopic infections of study participants who were active in nocturnal outdoor activities versus those who were not active (OR = 0.91). Patients who participated in nocturnal outdoor activities and use LLINs while indoors had a slightly higher risk of submicroscopic infection than those who did not use LLINs (OR = 1.48).  Conclusion:   Microscopic inspection of blood smears from persons with malaria symptoms for asexual stage P. falciparum should be supplemented by more sensitive diagnostic tests in order to reduce ongoing transmission of P. falciparum parasites to local mosquito vectors.""","""['Kevin O Ochwedo', 'Collince J Omondi', 'Edwin O Magomere', 'Julius O Olumeh', 'Isaiah Debrah', 'Shirley A Onyango', 'Pauline W Orondo', 'Benyl M Ondeto', 'Harrysone E Atieli', 'Sidney O Ogolla', 'John Githure', 'Antony C A Otieno', 'Andrew K Githeko', 'James W Kazura', 'Wolfgang R Mukabana', 'Yan Guiyan']""","""[' Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya. kevinochwedo@gmail.com.', ' Sub-Saharan Africa International Centre for Excellence in Malaria Research, Homa Bay, Kenya. kevinochwedo@gmail.com.', ' Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', ' Sub-Saharan Africa International Centre for Excellence in Malaria Research, Homa Bay, Kenya.', ' Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Egerton University, Njoro, Kenya.', ' West Africa Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogen, Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.', ' Centre for Global Health Research, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kisumu, Kenya.', ' Centre for Global Health and Diseases, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', ' Program in Public Health, College of Health Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Malar J""","""['Asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium infections in an area before and during integrated vector control in Homa Bay, western Kenya.', 'Assessment of submicroscopic infections and gametocyte carriage of Plasmodium falciparum during peak malaria transmission season in a community-based cross-sectional survey in western Kenya, 2012.', 'Risk associations of submicroscopic malaria infection in lakeshore, plateau and highland areas of Kisumu County in western Kenya.', 'The prevalence and density of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections among children and adults in three communities of western Kenya.', 'Evidence of asymptomatic submicroscopic malaria in low transmission areas in Belaga district, Kapit division, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Clinical malaria incidence and health seeking pattern in geographically heterogeneous landscape of western Kenya.', 'Asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium infections in an area before and during integrated vector control in Homa Bay, western Kenya.', 'Molecular characterization and genotype distribution of thioester-containing protein 1 gene in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in western Kenya.', 'Malaria epidemic and transmission foci in highland of Kisii, western Kenya.', 'Rare Alleles and Signatures of Selection on the Immunodominant Domains of Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 in Malaria Parasites From Western Kenya.']"""

Lymphopenia has been described as an important feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and has been associated with severe disease manifestation. Lymphocyte dysregulation and hyper-inflammation have been shown to be associated with a more severe clinical course; however, a T cell subpopulation whose dysfunction correlate with disease progression has yet to be identify.  Methods:   We performed an immuno-phenotypic analysis of T cell sub-populations in peripheral blood from patients affected by different severity of COVID-19 (n=60) and undergoing a different clinical evolution. Clinical severity was established based on a modified WHO score considering both ventilation support and respiratory capacity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio). The ability of circulating cells at baseline to predict the probability of clinical aggravation was explored through multivariate regression analyses.  Results:   The immuno-phenotypic analysis performed by multi-colour flow cytometry confirmed that patients suffering from severe COVID-19 harboured significantly reduced circulating T cell subsets, especially for CD4+ T, Th1, and regulatory T cells. Peripheral T cells also correlated with parameters associated with disease severity, i.e., PaO2/FiO2 ratio and inflammation markers. CD4+ T cell subsets showed an important significant association with clinical evolution, with patients presenting markedly decreased regulatory T cells at baseline having a significantly higher risk of aggravation. Importantly, the combination of gender and regulatory T cells allowed distinguishing between improved and worsened patients with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 82%.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates the association between CD4+ T cell dysregulation and COVID-19 severity and progression. Our results support the importance of analysing baseline regulatory T cell levels, since they were revealed able to predict the clinical worsening during hospitalization. Regulatory T cells assessment soon after hospital admission could thus allow a better clinical stratification and patient management.""","""['Sara Caldrer', 'Cristina Mazzi', 'Milena Bernardi', 'Marco Prato', 'Niccolò Ronzoni', 'Paola Rodari', 'Andrea Angheben', 'Chiara Piubelli', 'Natalia Tiberti']""","""[' Department of Infectious - Tropical Diseases and Microbiology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Sacro Cuore - Don Calabria Hospital, Verona, Italy.', ' Centre for Clinical Research, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Sacro Cuore - Don Calabria Hospital, Verona, Italy.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Immunol""","""['CD4 and CD8 Lymphocyte Counts as Surrogate Early Markers for Progression in SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: A Prospective Study.', 'Impaired Cytotoxic Response in PBMCs From Patients With COVID-19 Admitted to the ICU: Biomarkers to Predict Disease Severity.', 'Longitudinal Analysis of Human Memory T-Cell Response According to the Severity of Illness up to 8 Months After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.', 'T cell immunobiology and cytokine storm of COVID-19.', 'Immunological Biomarkers of COVID-19.', 'Epigenetic immune monitoring for COVID-19 disease course prognosis.', 'Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) and COVID-19: Unveiling the Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Potentialities with a Special Focus on Long COVID.', 'Differential regulatory T cell signature after recovery from mild COVID-19.', 'Donor selection for adoptive cell therapy with CD45RA- memory T cells for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and dexamethasone and interleukin-15 effects on the phenotype, proliferation and interferon gamma release.', 'A scoping review of regulatory T cell dynamics in convalescent COVID-19 patients - indications for their potential involvement in the development of Long COVID?']"""

Despite this urgency, there are significant limitations in the traditional surveillance system, mainly in vulnerable areas. This study aimed to investigate the circulation of dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) by laboratory syndromic surveillance (LSS) in a slum area of the Federal District of Brazil, comparing the results with traditional surveillance data.  Methods:   LSS for acute febrile and/or exanthematous symptoms was developed at a health unit of Cidade Estrutural, in order to identify the circulation of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitos. Between June 2019 and March 2020, 131 valid participants were identified and sera tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for DENV (by serotype), ZIKV, and CHIKV acute infection and by immunoglobulin M enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA-IgM) for DENV and CHIKV 15-21 days after symptom onset, when the participant reported no respiratory signs (cough and/or coryza). The results obtained were compared with traditional surveillance data for the study area and period.  Results:   At least three DENV-1 (2.3%), four DENV-2 (3%), and one CHIKV (0.7%) cases were confirmed in the laboratory, showing evidence of hyperendemicity even though LSS had not reached the historic peak dengue fever months in the Federal District (April-May). When the results obtained here were compared with traditional surveillance, a significant discrepancy was observed, including underreporting of CHIKV infection.  Conclusions:   In addition to the risks posed to the study population, the area investigated with its respective socio-environmental profile may be a potential site for spread of the virus, given the cosmopolitan presence of Aedes sp. and human mobility in the Federal District. It is also suggested that traditional epidemiological surveillance may be reporting acute viral infections other than DENV as dengue fever, while underreporting other arboviruses transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitos in the Federal District.""","""['Paulo Rufalco-Moutinho', 'Lorena Aparecida Gonçalves de Noronha', 'Tatyane de Souza Cardoso Quintão', 'Tayane Ferreira Nobre', 'Ana Paula Sampaio Cardoso', 'Daiani Cristina Cilião-Alves', 'Marco Aurélio Bellocchio Júnior', 'Mateus de Paula von Glehn', 'Rodrigo Haddad', 'Gustavo Adolfo Sierra Romero', 'Wildo Navegantes de Araújo']""","""[' Center of Tropical Medicine, University of Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. paulorufalco@gmail.com.', ' Ceilândia Faculty, University of Brasília, Federal District, Brazil.', ' Center of Tropical Medicine, University of Brasília, Federal District, Brazil.', ' UNIEURO University Center, Federal District, Brazil.', ' Federal District Department of Health, Federal District, Brazil.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Parasit Vectors""","""['Zika virus displacement by a chikungunya outbreak in Recife, Brazil.', 'Monitoring arbovirus in Thailand: Surveillance of dengue, chikungunya and zika virus, with a focus on coinfections.', 'Emerging arboviruses in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: Chikungunya and Zika outbreaks, 2014-2016.', 'Minireview: Epidemiological impact of arboviral diseases in Latin American countries, arbovirus-vector interactions and control strategies.', 'Human Urban Arboviruses Can Infect Wild Animals and Jump to Sylvatic Maintenance Cycles in South America.', 'Clinical Landscape and Rate of Exposure to Ilheus Virus: Insights from Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Glucose-centric pathways (GCP) identify low glucose in the first 2 hours of life that may not represent clinical hypoglycaemia and can lead to inappropriate glucose management with infusions and medications.  Objective:   To study the impact of a feed-centric pathway (FCP) on the number of admissions for hypoglycaemia to level 2 special care nursery (SCN) and the need for parenteral glucose/medications, compared to GCP.  Methods:   This project was conducted over 2 years, before and after switching from a GCP to FCP in our institution. FCP involves skin-to-skin care, early breast feeding, checking glucose at 2 hours and use of buccal glucose. The primary outcome was the number of SCN admissions for hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes include the number of infants needing intravenous glucose, medications and length of SCN stay.  Results:   Of 23 786 live births, 4438 newborns were screened. We screened more infants at-risk for hypoglycaemia using the FCP (GCP:1462/11969, 12.2% vs FCP:2976/11817, 25.1%) but significantly reduced SCN admissions (GCP:246/1462, 16.8% vs FCP:102/2976, 3.4%; p<0.0001). Fewer but proportionally more FCP newborns required intravenous glucose (GCP: 136/246, 55% vs FCP: 88/102, 86%; p=0.000). Compared with GCP, FCP reduced the total duration of stay in SCN by 104 days per annum, reducing the cost of care. However, the mean length of SCN stay for FCP was higher (GCP:2.43 days vs FCP:3.49 days; p=0.001). There were no readmissions for neonatal hypoglycaemia to our institution.  Conclusion:   The use of FCP safely reduced SCN admissions, averted avoidable escalation of care and helped identify infants who genuinely required intravenous glucose and SCN care, allowing more efficient utilisation of healthcare resources.""","""['Suresh Chandran', 'Jia Xuan Siew', 'Victor Samuel Rajadurai', 'Rachel Wei Shan Lim', 'Mei Chien Chua', 'Fabian Yap']""","""["" Department of Neonatology, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore suresh.chandran@singhealth.com.sg."", ' Paediatric Academic Clinical Programme, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore.', ' Paediatric Academic Clnical Programme, Duke NUS Medical School, Singapore.', "" Division of Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore."", "" Department of Neonatology, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore."", ' Department of Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore.', "" Division of Paediatric Endocrinology, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""BMJ Open Qual""","""['Admissions for hypoglycaemia after 35\xa0weeks of gestation: perinatal predictors of cost of stay.', 'Nursing and midwifery management of hypoglycaemia in healthy term neonates.', 'Fasting C-peptide, a biomarker for hypoglycaemia risk in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes initiating basal insulin glargine 100\u2009U/mL.', 'Nursing and midwifery management of hypoglycaemia in healthy term neonates.', 'Neonates at high risk of hypoglycaemia: Is admission necessary?', 'Case Report: Neurodevelopmental Outcome in a Small-for-Gestational-Age Infant With Symptomatic Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia, Gaze Preference, and Infantile Spasms.']"""

Evidence on the economic effects of this approach on individuals and households in low-resource settings is scarce. We aimed to examine the effect of universal HIV testing and treatment on a range of economic outcomes.  Methods:   We collected data in household surveys done over a 3-year period in a sample of HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults participating in a cluster-randomised trial of universal HIV testing and treatment in 32 rural communities in Kenya and Uganda. Communities of approximately 10 000 people were pair-matched on the basis of geographical and population characteristics, with the best-matching 16 pairs randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups. Participants in intervention communities received annual HIV and multidisease testing, universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility, and patient-centred care. Participants in control communities received baseline testing and medical care according to national guidelines. We analysed employment and health-care utilisation outcomes for working-age adults (age 18-65 years) and education outcomes for school-age children (6-17 years) using data from 3 years after the intervention. This trial is now complete, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01864603.  Findings:   Between July 9, 2013, and June 15, 2017, we collected survey data on 8198 working-age adults and 6755 school-age children. Compared with adults living with HIV in control communities, adults living with HIV in intervention communities were more likely to be employed (difference 9·7% [95% CI 2·1 to 18·3]), less likely to seek health care (-10·3% [-22·0 to 0·1]), and less likely to spend money on health care (-12·7% [-22·4 to 0·6]) 3 years after the intervention. We found no significant differences in outcomes between HIV-negative adults in intervention and control communities. Among children in households with HIV-positive adults, the intervention led to a 7·3% (95% CI 1·0 to 15·1) increase in primary school completion after 3 years in intervention communities compared with control communities.  Interpretation:   Universal HIV testing and treatment improved employment outcomes and other indicators of socioeconomic wellbeing for HIV-positive adults and children in their households, but had no effect on HIV-negative adults. Our findings suggest that the considerable investments needed to expand ART access might have substantial short-term and long-term economic returns.

Respiratory viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to identify the infecting viruses. IFA negative 100 NPA samples were tested for human metapeumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus and corona viruses by polymerase chain reaction. Of the 443 and 418 NPAs, 37.2% and 39.4% were positive for any of the 8 different respiratory viruses tested from two centers studied. Viral co-infection was detected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in both centers. Peak viral detection was noted in the wet zone from May-July 2013 and 2014 and in the dry zone from December-January 2014 suggesting a local seasonality for viral ARTI. RSV showed a clear seasonality with a direct correlation of monthly RSV infections with rainy days in the wet zone and an inverse correlation with temperature in both centers. The case fatality rate was 2.7% for RSV associated ARTI. The overall disability adjusted life years was 335.9 and for RSV associated ARTI it was 241.8. RSV was the commonly detected respiratory virus with an annual seasonality and distribution in rainy seasons in the dry and wet zones of Sri Lanka.

However, in Japan, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the incidence of ACS. In the study, eleven hospitals in the Tokai region participated. Among enrolled hospital, we compared the incidence of ACS during the COVID-19 pandemic (April and May, 2020) with that in equivalent months in the preceding year as the control. During the study period; April and May 2020, 248 patients with ACS were admitted. Compared to April and May 2019, a decline of 8.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.1; P = 0.33] in admissions for ACS was observed between April and May 2020.

Placement of shunt is one of the common surgical methods. This study analyzed the effects of different shunt strategies on cerebral infarction after carotid endarterectomy.  Methods:   A total of 443 patients who underwent CEA under general anesthesia within 2 years were divided into imaging group (based on preoperative imaging data as the basis for shunt) and stump pressure group (based on intraoperative stump pressure as the basis for shunt). The preoperative demographic data, past medical history, degree of cervical vascular stenosis, blood pressure at each time point during the perioperative period, vascular blocking time, whether to place the shunt, postoperative hospital stay, cerebral infarction during hospitalization, and other adverse events were collected and compared between the two groups. On this basis, the preoperative and intraoperative conditions with significant differences were matched with propensity scores, and the influence of different shunt strategies on postoperative cerebral infarction was analyzed.  Results:   In the study, 268 patients in the imaging group and 175 patients in the stump pressure group underwent CEA under general anesthesia. There were statistically significant differences in basic conditions and blood pressure at each time point between the two groups. After matching the propensity scores, 105 patients in each of the two groups were matched. The basic conditions of the patients before surgery and the difference in blood pressure of the two groups at each time point were not statistically significant. There was no significant diffe-rence in the incidence of postoperative cerebral infarction between the two groups (1.9% vs. 1.0%, P>0.999). The intraoperative shunt rate in the imaging group was lower than that in the stump pressure group (0 vs. 22.9%, P < 0.001). The postoperative hospital stay in the imaging group was 8 (7, 8) days, which was longer than the stump pressure group 5 (4, 6) days (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The rate of the shunt was lower according to preoperative imaging examination than that according to the residual pressure in our hospital.

Methods:   In the study, 148 patients who underwent isolated CABG in Peking University People's Hospital from January 1, 2017 to December 30, 2017 were enrolled, of whom 39 had new-onset AF. The fasting venous blood was collected within 24 hours before the surgery. The preoperative plasma IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, Hcy, ET-1 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patients were divided into AF group and non-AF group according to whether new-onset AF occurred after operation. After 1 ∶1 propensity score matching (PSM), 38 people were in each group. The paired sample t-tests were performed on the five factors' concentrations of the matched AF group and the non-AF group respectively. If the concentration values did not conform to the normal distribution, the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was performed. Conditional Logistic regression analysis was performed on the concentrations of the five indicators to explore the correlation between preoperative plasma concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, Hcy, ET-1 and postoperative new-onset AF after CABG.  Results:   After a 1 ∶1 propensity score matching, the AF group was comparable to the non-AF group.

The correlation between preoperative low plasma ET-1 concentration and the new-onset AF after CABG were statistically significant (P=0.003). After conditional Logistic regression analysis, preoperative plasma ET-1 concentration was correlated with postoperative new-onset AF after CABG (P=0.039, adjusted OR=0.637, 95%CI: 0.415-0.977).

Therefore, they need to be accurately quantified to develop an effective mitigation strategy. Although the spread of the emission flux estimates for China have recently narrowed under the constraints of atmospheric observations, consensus has not been reached regarding the dominant emission sector. Here, we quantified the contribution of the residential sector, as 64% (44-82%) in 2019, using the response of the observed atmospheric concentration in the outflowing air during Feb-Mar 2020, with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic and restricted human activities over China. In detail, the BC emission fluxes, estimated after removing effects from meteorological variability, dropped only slightly (- 18%) during Feb-Mar 2020 from the levels in the previous year for selected air masses of Chinese origin, suggesting the contributions from the transport and industry sectors (36%) were smaller than the rest from the residential sector (64%).

This study aims to predict the number of TB cases in Gombak based on sociodemographic and environmental factors.  Methods:   The sociodemographic data of 3325 TB cases from January 2013 to December 2017 in Gombak district were collected from the MyTB web and TB Information System database. Environmental data were obtained from the Department of Environment, Malaysia; Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Malaysia; and Malaysian Metrological Department from July 2012 to December 2017. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to develop the prediction model of TB cases. The models that used sociodemographic variables as the input datasets were referred as MLR1 and ANN1, whereas environmental variables were represented as MLR2 and ANN2 and both sociodemographic and environmental variables together were indicated as MLR3 and ANN3.  Results:   The ANN was found to be superior to MLR with higher adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) values in predicting TB cases; the ranges were from 0.35 to 0.47 compared to 0.07 to 0.14, respectively. The best TB prediction model, that is, ANN3 was derived from nationality, residency, income status, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, rainfall, temperature, and atmospheric pressure, with the highest adjusted R2 value of 0.47, errors below 6, and accuracies above 96%.

Mycobacteria are pathogens increasingly isolated from postvaccination abscess. Identification of these pathogens plays a very crucial role in the management of these babies. We aimed to determine Mycobacterial spp occurrence from vaccination abscess, draw local antibiogram, and guide management of babies with vaccination abscess.  Methods:   Babies with postvaccination abscess from 2016 to 2020 were included. Pus collected during incision and drainage was processed as per the standard guidelines. Mycobacterium isolates were identified by conventional methods, and all samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. All babies underwent incision and drainage, and all were started with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and changed later as per the sensitivity report.  Results:   Mycobacterium abscessus was isolated from 17% (12) pus samples from 71 postdiphtheria pertussis and tetanus vaccination, and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 83.3% (10) babies with post-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination. The mean interval between injection and abscess formation was 32.75 days in case of M. abscessus, whereas it was 50.4 days in case of M. bovis. All the M. abscessus were sensitive to linezolid, amikacin, and clarithromycin, whereas no treatment except incision and drainage was required for M. bovis.

As integrators of landscape catchment, lakes can reflect and record biological and geochemical events or anthropogenic changes and provide useful knowledge to formulate public health, food security and water policies to manage and prevent diseases. In this context, potentially pathogenic fungi and parasites were sampled using 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in 382 lakes displaying a broad range of sizes and human impact on the watershed in 10 ecozones across Canada. Based on pathogen classifications from the ePATHogen database published by the Public Health Agency of Canada, we identified 23 health-relevant genera for human and animal hosts, including Cryptococcus and Cryptosporidium. Our study investigated the potential of remote sensing and geomatics to predict microbial contamination in a tele-epidemiological approach. We used boosted regression tree modeling to evaluate the probability of occurrence of the most common genera found in our dataset based on 10 satellite-derivable, geomatics and field survey variables which could be potential sources or transport mechanisms through the watershed or survival factors in the water. We found that southern ecozones that possess the highest agricultural and pasture activities tend to contain lakes with the largest number of potential pathogens including several fungi associated with plant diseases. Bio-optical factors, such as colored dissolved organic matter, were highly related to the occurrence of the genera, potentially by protecting against damage from ultraviolet light.

After a decade of a virtuous circle of growth with the creation of formal jobs, the pandemic has had an considerable impact on the region's labor market, generating an unparalleled increase in the proportion of the inactive population, considerable reductions in informality, and, in contrast, smaller fluctuations in formal jobs. In this context, the formal sector, given its lower flexibility, became a ""social safety net"" that preserved the stability of employment and wages. Based on the findings presented in this paper, it is projected that, starting in 2021, informality will grow to levels higher than those of the pre-COVID-19 era-with 7.56 million additional informal jobs-as a result of the population returning to the labor market to compensate for the declines in incomes. According to the simulations presented, postponing or forgiving income tax payments and social security contributions conditional on the generation of formal jobs could reduce the growth of informality by 50 to 75 percent.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model predicting the order of symptoms based on data from the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China using symptom occurrence at diagnosis and found that the order of COVID-19 symptoms differed from that of other infectious diseases including influenza. Whether this order of COVID-19 symptoms holds in the USA under changing conditions is unclear. Here, we use modeling to predict the order of symptoms using data from both the initial outbreaks in China and in the USA. Whereas patients in China were more likely to have fever before cough and then nausea/vomiting before diarrhea, patients in the USA were more likely to have cough before fever and then diarrhea before nausea/vomiting. Given that the D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant that rapidly spread from Europe to predominate in the USA during the first wave of the outbreak was not present in the initial China outbreak, we hypothesized that this mutation might affect symptom order. Supporting this notion, we found that as SARS-CoV-2 in Japan shifted from the original Wuhan reference strain to the D614G variant, symptom order shifted to the USA pattern. Google Trends analyses supported these findings, while weather, age, and comorbidities did not affect our model's predictions of symptom order. These findings indicate that symptom order can change with mutation in viral disease and raise the possibility that D614G variant is more transmissible because infected people are more likely to cough in public before being incapacitated with fever.""","""['Joseph R Larsen', 'Margaret R Martin', 'John D Martin', 'James B Hicks', 'Peter Kuhn']""","""[' Quantitative and Computational Biology, Department of Biological Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', ' Convergent Science Institute in Cancer, Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', ' Department of Computer Science, Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts, United States of America.', ' Materia Therapeutics, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States of America.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases at a screening clinic during the early outbreak period: a single-centre study.', 'Clinical characteristics of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients with a prolonged negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection.', 'Co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A in a hemodialysis patient: a case report.', 'A case of COVID-19 patient with the diarrhea as initial symptom and literature review.', 'Maternal and infant outcomes of full-term pregnancy combined with COVID-2019 in Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.', ""Severe COVID-19 as a Possible Mediator of Autoimmunity and Sjögren's Syndrome."", 'Evolution of differences in clinical presentation across epidemic waves among patients with COVID-like-symptoms who received care at the Mexican Social Security Institute.', 'Insights from comparison of the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in an Italian internal medicine ward during first and third wave.', 'Evaluating Time Influence over Performance of Machine-Learning-Based Diagnosis: A Case Study of COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil.', 'Early Breast Cancer Evolution by Autosomal Broad Copy Number Alterations.']"""

Design:   We compared the characteristics of the children who died in 2020, split by SARS-CoV-2 status. A negative binomial regression model was used to compare mortality rates in lockdown (23 March-28 June), with those children who died in the preceding period (6 January-22 March), as well as a comparable period in 2019.  Setting:   England.  Participants:   Children (0-17 years).  Main outcome measures:   Characteristics and number of the children who died in 2020, split by SARS-CoV-2 status.  Results:   1550 deaths of children between 6th of January and 28 June 2020 were notified to the NCMD; 437 of the deaths were linked to SARS-CoV-2 virology records, 25 (5.7%) had a positive PCR result. PCR-positive children were less likely to be white (37.5% vs 69.4%, p=0.003) and were older (12.2 vs 0.7 years, p<0.0006) compared with child deaths without evidence of the virus. All-cause mortality rates were similar during lockdown compared with both the period before lockdown in 2020 (rate ratio (RR) 0.93 (0.84 to 1.02)) and a similar period in 2019 (RR 1.02 (0.92 to 1.13)).

In absence of vaccination, the same number of cases is obtained by resuming only about one third of pre-pandemic contacts, with about 12,100 (95% CI: 6,600-21,000) extra deaths (+27%; 95% CI: 15-47%). Vaccination offset the effect of the Delta variant in summer 2021. The future epidemic trend is surrounded by substantial uncertainty.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum are obligate intracellular bacteria of the family Anaplasmatacae, transmitted by Ixodid ticks and cause granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE)) in a wide range of wild and domestic mammals and humans too. The aim of this study was to determine whether Anaplasma phagocytophilum was circulating in olive baboons and vervet monkeys in Laikipia County, Kenya.  Results:   Some 146 blood samples collected from olive baboons and 18 from vervet monkeys from Mpala Research Center and Ol jogi Conservancy in Laikipia County were screened for the presence of Anaplasma species using conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and then A. phagocytophilum was confirmed by sequencing using conventional PCR targeting 16S rRNA. This study found an overall prevalence of 18.3% for Anaplasma species. DNA sequences confirmed Anaplasma phagocytophilum in olive baboons for the first time in Kenya.  Conclusion:   This study provides valuable information on the endemicity of A. phagocytophilum bacteria in olive baboons in Kenya.

FD is a known cause of stroke in younger patients. There are limited data on prevalence of FD and stroke risk in unselected stroke patients.  Methods:   A prospective nationwide study including 35 (78%) of all 45 stroke centers and all consecutive stroke patients admitted during three months. Clinical data were collected in the RES-Q database. FD was diagnosed using dried blood spots in a stepwise manner: in males-enzymatic activity, globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) quantification, if positive followed by GLA gene sequencing; and in females GLA sequencing followed by lyso-Gb3.  Results:   986 consecutive patients (54% men, mean age 70 years) were included. Observed stroke type was ischemic 79%, transient ischemic attack (TIA) 14%, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) 7%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 1% and cerebral venous thrombosis 0.1%. Two (0.2%, 95% CI 0.02-0.7) patients had a pathogenic variant associated with the classical FD phenotype (c.1235_1236delCT and p.G325S). Another fourteen (1.4%, 95% CI 0.08-2.4) patients had a variant of GLA gene considered benign (9 with p.D313Y, one p.A143T, one p.R118C, one p.V199A, one p.R30K and one p.R38G). The index stroke in two carriers of disease-associated variant was ischemic lacunar. In 14 carriers of GLA gene variants 11 strokes were ischemic, two TIA, and one ICH. Patients with positive as compared to negative GLA gene screening were younger (mean 60±SD, min, max, vs 70±SD, min, max, P = 0.02), otherwise there were no differences in other baseline variables.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of FD in unselected adult patients with acute stroke is 0.2%. Both patients who had a pathogenic GLA gene variant were younger than 50 years.

Although the real cigarette prices increased by around 4% during the 2010-2015 period, the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking among men decreased slightly from 31.3% to 30.7% during this period. This raises the question of whether cigarette consumption is sensitive to price. In this study, we estimated the effect of cigarette prices on smoking participation and tobacco expenditure in Vietnam. We found that a one-percent increase in the real cigarette price reduced the probability of cigarette smoking among males by 0.08 percentage points (95% CI from -0.06 to -0.10), equivalent to the price elasticity of the smoking prevalence at -0.26 (95% CI from -0.16% to -0.33%). Using this estimate, we predict that if the cigarette price is increased by 10%, the daily cigarette smoking prevalence among men would decrease from 30.7% to 29.9% and the number of male smokers would decline by around 270 thousand. Higher cigarette prices also reduced per capita tobacco expenditure of households. A one-percent increase in the cigarette price decreased per capita expenditure on tobacco consumption expenditure of households by 0.43 percent (the 95% CI from -0.029 to 0.822). This finding suggests that raising tobacco taxes and prices can be an effective measure to reduce tobacco use.""","""['Cuong Viet Nguyen', 'Thu Thi Le', 'Nguyen Hanh Nguyen']""","""[' International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', ' IPAG Business School, Paris, France.', ' HealthBridge Foundation of Canada, Hanoi, Vietnam.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""PLoS One""","""['How Much Is Too Much?

The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.""","""['Fuminari Miura', 'Ka Yin Leung', 'Don Klinkenberg', 'Kylie E C Ainslie', 'Jacco Wallinga']""","""[' Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands.', ' Center for Marine Environmental Studies (CMES), Ehime University, Ehime, Japan.', ' School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', ' MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, the Netherlands.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time attack-rate estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.', 'Time-varying optimization of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the context of limited vaccination capacity.', 'Modelling direct and herd protection effects of vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in Australia.', 'COVID-19: Warp Speed vaccines.', 'SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: A critical perspective through efficacy data and barriers to herd immunity.', 'An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies under uncertainty for COVID-19.', 'Asymptotic Analysis of Optimal Vaccination Policies.', 'Comparative analysis of humoral responses to BNT162b2 vaccine among patients with hematologic disorders and organ transplant recipients.']"""

We performed a multicenter study to evaluate the performance and analytical sensitivity of the LabTurbo AIO 48 system for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using 652 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples from patients. The LabTurbo AIO 48 system demonstrated a sensitivity of 9.4 copies/per PCR for N2 of SARS-CoV-2; 24 copies/per PCR for M of influenza A and B; and 24 copies/per PCR for N of RSV. The assay presented consistent performance in the multicenter study. The multiplex RT-PCR applied on the LabTurbo AIO 48 open platform provided highly sensitive, robust, and accurate results and enabled high-throughput detection of B.1.1.7, influenza A/B, and RSV with short turnaround times. Therefore, this automated molecular diagnostic assay could enable streamlined testing if COVID-19 becomes a seasonal disease.""","""['Hsing-Yi Chung', 'Ming-Jr Jian', 'Chih-Kai Chang', 'Jung-Chung Lin', 'Kuo-Ming Yeh', 'Ya-Sung Yang', 'Chien-Wen Chen', 'Shan-Shan Hsieh', 'Sheng-Hui Tang', 'Cherng-Lih Perng', 'Feng-Yee Chang', 'Kuo-Sheng Hung', 'En-Sung Chen', 'Mei-Hsiu Yang', 'Hung-Sheng Shang']""","""[' Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', ' Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', ' Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', ' Center for Precision Medicine and Genomics, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', ' Department of Clinical Pathology, Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Evaluation of Three Multiplex Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR Assays for Simultaneous Detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Nasopharyngeal Swabs.', 'Novel dual multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus using the BD MAX open system.', 'Clinical evaluation of a fully automated, laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR assay integrating dual-target SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B detection on a high-throughput platform.', 'European multicenter evaluation of Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV test.', 'Novel automated sample-to-result SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-developed RT-PCR assay for high-throughput testing using LabTurbo AIO 48 system.', 'High-Throughput and Automated Detection of HLA-B*27 Using the LabTurboTM AIO System.', 'The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection: A Narrative Review.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Tools against SARS-CoV-2 in Poland in 2022.', 'Influenza A, Influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 Similarities and Differences - A Focus on Diagnosis.', 'Emergency SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: rapidly direct RT-qPCR detection without RNA extraction, clinical comparison, cost-effective, and high-throughput.']"""

Although it has been well documented that the frequency and fatality rates of intersection-related motorcycle crashes are high, little research efforts have been made to explore the contributory factors influencing motorcycle-involved crashes at these locations. Interestingly, no study has investigated the latent patterns and chains of factors that simultaneously contribute to the injury severity sustained by motorcycle crash casualties at intersections under different traffic control conditions in developing countries. Since motorcycles are mostly used as taxis in developing countries, it is imperative to consider the injury severity sustained by all crash casualties in the motorcycle safety analysis. This study bridges the research gap by employing a plausible data mining tool to explore hidden rules associated with motorcycle crash casualty injury severity outcomes at both signalized and non-signalized intersections in Ghana's most densely populated region, Accra, using three-year crash data spanning 2016-2018. Besides, a binary logit regression model was also employed to explore the impact of crash factors on casualty severity outcomes using the same dataset. The results from both analysis techniques were consistent; however, the data mining technique provided chains of factors which provided additional insights into the groups of factors that collectively influence the casualty injury severity outcomes. From the rule discovery results, while full license status, daytime/daylight, and shoulder presence increased the risk of fatal injuries at signalized intersections, factors such as inattentiveness, good road surface, nighttime, shoulder absence, and young rider were highly likely to increase casualty fatalities at non-signalized intersections. By controlling all or some of these risk factors, the level of injury severity on the roadways could be reduced. Based on the findings, we provide enforcement, education, and engineering-based recommendations to help improve motorcycle safety.""","""['Reuben Tamakloe', 'Subasish Das', 'Eric Nimako Aidoo', 'Dongjoo Park']""","""[' Department of Transportation Engineering, The University of Seoul, 163 Seoulsiripdae-ro Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02504, South Korea.

The extent of the single bicycle crashes (SBCs) and crash causes are rather well studied. This study expands this knowledge by focusing on differences in injury severity. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between injury severity and characteristics of the crash and the cyclist with focus on SBCs. Furthermore, injury risk is calculated for different age classes and sexes, as well as for different purposes of the trip. The results are based on injured cyclists in Sweden (N = 105,836) registered in STRADA, 2010-2019, by both the police and accident and emergency departments (A&Es), with a special focus on injury severity reported by the A&Es. Binary logistic regression was applied to analyse how the odds of being severely injured differed for different cyclists and situations. Results from of the National Travel Survey, 2011-2016, were used to study differences in distance travelled with respect to sex, age group and purpose of the trip. Given that the cyclist is injured in an SBC, the results show a higher probability of being severely injured (maximal AIS 3 or more) for cyclists 45 years or older compared to younger cyclists, for males compared to females and for cyclists not wearing a helmet compared to cyclists wearing a helmet. A higher probability for severe injury was also found for crashes occurring during leisure trips compared to work/school trips, crashes occurring during weekdays compared to weekends and crashes at intersections and road stretches compared to pedestrian and cycle paths. Furthermore, the risk of being severely injured in an SBC per km travelled was higher for cyclists aged 45 and older and during a leisure trip.""","""['Jenny Eriksson', 'Anna Niska', 'Åsa Forsman']""","""[' Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute: Statens väg- och transportforskningsinstitut, Linköping, Sweden.

To control this pandemic continuous mutational surveillance and genomic epidemiology of circulating strains is very important to unveil the emergence of the novel variants and also monitor the evolution of existing variants.  Methods:   SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from GISAID database. Sequence alignment was performed with MAFT version 7. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by using MEGA (version X) and UShER.  Results:   In this study, we reported the emergence of a novel variant of SARS-CoV-2, named B.1.1.526, in India. This novel variant encompasses 129 SARS-CoV-2 strains which are characterized by the presence of 11 coexisting mutations including D614G, P681H, and V1230L in S glycoprotein. Out of these 129 sequences, 27 sequences also harbored E484K mutation in S glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strains of this novel variant emerged from the GR clade and formed a new cluster. Geographical distribution showed, out of 129 sequences, 126 were found in seven different states of India. Rest 3 sequences were observed in USA. Temporal analysis revealed this novel variant was first collected from Kolkata district of West Bengal, India.  Conclusions:   The D614G, P618H and E484K mutations have previously been reported to favor increased transmissibility, enhanced infectivity, and immune invasion, respectively. The transmembrane domain (TM) of S2 subunit anchors S glycoprotein to the virus envelope. The V1230L mutation, present within the TM domain of S glycoprotein, might strengthen the interaction of S glycoprotein with the viral envelope and increase S glycoprotein deposition to the virion, resulting in more infectious virion. Therefore, the new variant having D614G, P618H, V1230L, and E484K may have higher infectivity, transmissibility, and immune invasion characteristics, and thus need to be monitored closely.""","""['Rakesh Sarkar', 'Ritubrita Saha', 'Pratik Mallick', 'Ranjana Sharma', 'Amandeep Kaur', 'Shanta Dutta', 'Mamta Chawla-Sarkar']""","""[' ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', "" Department of Biotechnology, St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India."", ' Guru Nanak Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', ' ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

We aimed to explore factors affecting glycemic control among Indigenous Arabs with diabetes in Israel using a strengths-based approach that centered participants' knowledge of their context, needs, resources and strengths. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed methods study, which included 10 focus groups (5 men's, 5 women's) and 296 quantitative in-person surveys. Participants with diagnosed diabetes were randomly drawn from the patient list of the largest healthcare service organization (survey response rate: 93%). Prominent and interconnected themes emerged from focus group discussions, including: diet, physical activity, and social, economic, mental/psychological and political stress. The discussions raised the need for adapting diabetes management approaches to incorporate participants' communal, physical and psychological well-being, and socioeconomic/political realities. The connections between these factors and diabetes management were also reflected in multivariable analyses of the survey data. Women (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.09-4.63), people with disabilities (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.28-4.64), and unemployed people (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.28-5.44) had higher odds of economic barriers to diabetes management.

However, decision makers must contend with a multitude of demands on health budgets in the short or medium term, and costs per case often rise as the burden of a disease falls, rendering such efforts beyond the cost-effective use of scarce resources. In addition, these decisions must be made in the presence of substantial uncertainty regarding the feasibility and costs of elimination or eradication efforts. Therefore, analytical frameworks are necessary to consider the additional effort for reaching global goals, like elimination or eradication, that are beyond the cost-effective use of country resources.

Methods:   Using UK GP data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified patients diagnosed with AS between 1998 and 2017. We estimated the annual AS incidence, prevalence and length of time from first recorded symptom of back pain to rheumatology referral and diagnosis.  Results:   We identified 12 333 patients with AS. The incidence declined from 0.72 (±0.14) per 10 000 patient-years in 1998 to 0.39 (±0.06) in 2007, with this decline significant only in men, then incidence rose to 0.57 (±0.11) in 2017. By contrast, prevalence increased between 1998 and 2017 (from 0.13%±0.006 to 0.18%±0.006), rising steeply among women (from 0.06%±0.05 to 0.10%±0.06) and patients aged ≥60 (from 0.14%±0.01 to 0.26%±0.01). The overall median time from first symptom to rheumatology referral was 4.87 years (IQR=1.42-10.23). The median time from first symptom to diagnosis rose between 1998 and 2017 (from 3.62 years (IQR=1.14-7.07) to 8.31 (IQR=3.77-15.89)) and was longer in women (6.71 (IQR=2.30-12.36)) than men (5.65 (IQR=1.66-11.20)).  Conclusion:   AS incidence declined significantly between 1998 and 2007, with an increase between 2007 and 2017 that may be explained by an improvement in the recognition of AS or confidence in diagnosing AS over time, stemming from increased awareness of inflammatory back pain and the importance of early treatment. The rising AS prevalence may indicate improved patient survival.

From a road safety perspective, the overall question is what effects the human behavior shift brings on the crash occurrence and, more importantly, how to support decision-makers on safer mobility policies?  Method:   Based on anonymous mobile phone location and crash report data in New York City, this study attempts to provide some new insights by using survival analysis (the hazard function approach) to explore the effects of human mobility changes due to the pandemic on crashes that involve injuries and fatalities (of pedestrian, cyclist or motorist).  Results:   (1) the increased percentage of people staying at home improves pedestrian and cyclist safety, which adds evidence for making walking and cycling more appealing; (2) the increased percentage of people staying at home raises the likelihood of injuries for motor vehicle drivers, suggesting that it will be critical to monitor the driving behavior and establish new speed limits during the future pandemic waves and in the post-pandemic era as well; (3) non-work trips (e.g., shopping, recreation, personal business, etc.) are positively associated with crash injuries for motor vehicle drivers as well as pedestrian and cyclist; (4) human mobility factors were found not related to crash fatalities; (5) control NPIs implemented increased the motor vehicle drivers' crash risk.""","""['Ni Dong', 'Jie Zhang', 'Xiaobo Liu', 'Pengpeng Xu', 'Yina Wu', 'Hao Wu']""","""[' School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; National United Engineering Laboratory of Integrated and Intelligent Transportation, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

Prior reports suggest that genetic variants may modulate oxidative stress due to smoking, other environmental factors, and disease. Alternatively, these apparent modulations may reflect a dependence of genetic effects on 8-isoprostane concentrations.  Method:   To test whether genetic effects on 8-isoprostane concentrations are quantile-dependent, quantile-specific offspring-parent (βOP) and full-sib regression slopes (βFS) were estimated by applying quantile regression to the age- and sex-adjusted creatinine-standardized urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations of Framingham Heart Study families. Quantile-specific heritabilities were calculated as h2 = 2βOP/(1+rspouse) and h2 = {(1+8rspouseβFS)0.5-1}/(2rspouse)).  Results:   Spouse 8-isoprostane concentrations were weakly concordant (rspouse = 0.06). 8-isoprostane heritability (h2±SE) increased significantly with increasing percentiles of its distribution (Plinear trend = 0.0009, Pquadratic trend = 0.0007, Pcubic trend = 0.003) when estimated from βOP, and when estimated from βFS (Plinear trend = 0.005, Pquadratic trend = 0.09, Pcubic trend = 0.06). Compared to the 10th percentile, βOP-estimated h2 was over 22-fold greater at the 90th percentile (Pdifference = 9.2 × 10-5), and 5.3-fold greater when estimated from βFS (Pdifference = 0.004). Significantly higher 8-isoprostane heritability in smokers than nonsmokers (0.352 ± 0.147 vs. 0.061 ± 0.036, Pdifference = 0.01), and heavier than lighter drinkers (0.449 ± 0.216 vs. 0.078 ± 0.037, Pdifference = 0.01) were eliminated when corrected for the higher 8-isoprostane concentrations of the smokers and heavier drinkers.

This study aims to detect water tanks installed on rooftops and swimming pools in digital images to identify and classify areas based on the socioeconomic index, in order to assist public health programs in the control of diseases linked to the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This study covers four regions of Campinas, São Paulo, characterized by different socioeconomic contexts. With mosaics of images obtained by a 12.1 MP Canon PowerShot S100 (5.2 mm focal length) carried by unmanned aerial vehicles, we developed deep learning algorithms in the scope of computer vision for the detection of water tanks and swimming pools. An object detection model, which was initially created for areas of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, was enhanced using the transfer learning technique, and allowed us to detect objects in Campinas with fewer samples and more efficiency. With the detection of objects in digital images, the proportions of objects per square kilometer for each region studied were estimated by adopting a Chi-square distribution model. Thus, we found that regions with low socioeconomic status had more exposed water tanks, while regions with high socioeconomic levels had more exposed pools. Using deep learning approaches, we created a useful tool for Ae. aegypti control programs to utilize and direct disease prevention efforts. Therefore, we concluded that it is possible to detect objects directly related to the socioeconomic level of a given region from digital images, which encourages the practicality of this approach for studies aimed towards public health.""","""['Higor Souza Cunha', 'Brenda Santana Sclauser', 'Pedro Fonseca Wildemberg', 'Eduardo Augusto Militão Fernandes', 'Jefersson Alex Dos Santos', 'Mariana de Oliveira Lage', 'Camila Lorenz', 'Gerson Laurindo Barbosa', 'José Alberto Quintanilha', 'Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto']""","""[' Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnic School, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', ' Department of Computer Science, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', ' Environmental Science Graduation Program (PROCAM), Institute of Energy and Environment, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', ' Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Public Health, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', ' State Department of Health, Endemic Control Superintendence, São Paulo, Brazil.', ' Scientific Division of Environmental Management, Science and Technology, Institute of Energy and Environment, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""PLoS One""","""['A high-risk Zika and dengue transmission hub: virus detections in mosquitoes at a Brazilian university campus.', 'Entomological characterization of Aedes mosquitoes and arbovirus detection in Ibagué, a Colombian city with co-circulation of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses.', 'A Comprehensive Entomological, Serological and Molecular Study of 2013 Dengue Outbreak of Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.', 'Dengue outbreaks and the geographic distribution of dengue vectors in Taiwan: A 20-year epidemiological analysis.', 'A Review of the Control of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Continental United States.', 'A Privacy-Preserved Internet-of-Medical-Things Scheme for Eradication and Control of Dengue Using UAV.']"""

To describe associations between neighborhood racial and economic segregation and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. For 13 US cities, we obtained zip code-level data on 5 violence outcomes from March through July 2018 through 2020. Using negative binomial regressions and marginal contrasts, we estimated differences between quintiles of racial, economic, and racialized economic segregation using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes as a measure of neighborhood privilege (1) in 2020 and (2) relative to 2018 through 2019 (difference-in-differences). Results. In 2020, violence was higher in less-privileged neighborhoods than in the most privileged. For example, if all zip codes were in the least privileged versus most privileged quintile of racialized economic segregation, we estimated 146.2 additional aggravated assaults (95% confidence interval = 112.4, 205.8) per zip code on average across cities. Differences over time in less-privileged zip codes were greater than differences over time in the most privileged for firearm violence, aggravated assault, and homicide. Conclusions. Marginalized communities endure endemically high levels of violence. The events of 2020 exacerbated disparities in several forms of violence. Public Health Implications. To reduce violence and related disparities, immediate and long-term investments in low-income neighborhoods of color are warranted.

Methods:   We extracted data for the period from July 30 to October 10, 2021, from the Israel Ministry of Health database regarding 4,696,865 persons 16 years of age or older who had received two doses of BNT162b2 at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rates of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), severe illness, and death among those who had received a booster dose at least 12 days earlier (booster group) with the rates among those who had not received a booster (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we compared the rates in the booster group with the rates among those who had received a booster 3 to 7 days earlier (early postbooster group). We used Poisson regression models to estimate rate ratios after adjusting for possible confounding factors.  Results:   The rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of approximately 10 (range across five age groups, 9.0 to 17.2) and was lower in the booster group than in the early postbooster group by a factor of 4.9 to 10.8.

We introduce asthma seasons to elucidate whether air pollutants are associated with seasonal differences in asthma emergency department (ED) visits in a low air pollution environment. Within a Bayesian time-stratified case-crossover framework, we quantify seasonal associations between highly resolved estimates of six criteria air pollutants, two weather variables, and asthma ED visits among 66,092 children ages 5-19 living in South Carolina (SC) census tracts from 2005 to 2014. Results show that coarse particulates (particulate matter <10 μm and >2.5 μm: PM10-2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) may contribute to asthma ED visits across years, but are particularly implicated in the highest-burden fall asthma season. Fine particulate matter (<2.5 μm: PM2.5) is only associated in the lowest-burden summer asthma season. Relatively cool and dry conditions in the summer asthma season and increased temperatures in the spring and fall asthma seasons are associated with increased ED visit odds. Few significant associations in the medium-burden winter and medium-high-burden spring asthma seasons suggest other ED visit drivers (e.g., viral infections) for each, respectively.

We used quantile g-computation to estimate the change in each outcome per quartile increase in all chemicals within the mixture. Higher exposure to the mixture was associated with lower nonverbal IQ (-4.0 points (95%CI = -7.0, -1.0), -5.5 points (95%CI = -10.2, -0.9), and -4.6 points (95%CI = -10.8, 1.5) for the second, third, and fourth quartile, respectively, compared to the first quartile). These results were mainly driven by the phthalate mixture. No association was observed with emotional and behavioral problems. Prenatal exposure to nonpersistent chemical mixtures was associated with lower nonverbal IQ in children. Exposure to chemical mixtures during gestation is universal and may impact neurodevelopment.""","""['Michiel A van den Dries', 'Kelly K Ferguson', 'Alexander P Keil', 'Anjoeka Pronk', 'Suzanne Spaan', 'Akhgar Ghassabian', 'Susana Santos', 'Vincent W V Jaddoe', 'Leonardo Trasande', 'Henning Tiemeier', 'Mònica Guxens']""","""[' Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, 3015 CN The Netherlands.', ' The Generation R Study Group, Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Generation R Study Group, Rotterdam, 3015 CN The Netherlands.', ' ISGlobal, Barcelona, 08003, Spain.', ' Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, 08002, Spain.', ' Spanish Consortium for Research on Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid, 28029, Spain.', ' Epidemiology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Durham, North Carolina 27709, United States.', ' Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill North Carolina 27516, United States.', ' Department of Risk Analysis for Products in Development, TNO, Utrecht, 3584 CB, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York City, New York 10016, United States.', '0 Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York City, New York 10016, United States.', '1 Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York City, New York 10016, United States.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, 3015 CN The Netherlands.', '3 New York University Wagner School of Public Service, New York City, New York 10012, United States.', '4 New York University College of Global Public Health, New York City, New York 10003, United States.', '5 Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.

BOS has been documented to most severely affect the healthcare professions, especially dentists. On the other hand, its appearance has been documented at an early age, during dental training. However, there are no studies that analyze its incidence in professionals dedicated to Oral Surgery and Implantology, determining the age of onset and related factors.  Material and methods:   The modified Maslach questionnaire was carried out anonymously among the professors and students of the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology at the Complutense University of Madrid. A total of 36 participants were enrolled in this study and the results of the modified Maslach Questionnaire were established into four groups [1st year (n=6), 2nd year (n=6), 3rd year (n=6) postgraduate students and clinical teachers (n=18)]. The following variables were recorded: Age, sex, years of experience, weekly hours of work, dedication on weekends and scope of work. The statistical analysis performed included Pearson's correlation, analysis of variance, Student's t-test, F-Anova, Chi-Square and Gamma correlation. Statistical Significance of the tests was established of p≤0.05.  Results:   36 questionnaires were analyzed, of which 22.2% (n = 8) presented BOS, and 77.8% (n = 28) a medium risk of suffering it.

Objectives:   We investigated short-term associations between two pollutants [particulate matter <2.5 microns (PM2.5 ) and ozone] and PTB, and estimated excess PTB cases potentially attributed to these pollutants.  Methods:   This time-stratified case-crossover study includes 196,970 singleton pregnancies affected by PTB and early term birth from the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), California, USA (2007-2015). Daily ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated by the SJV Air Pollution Control District and geospatially linked to maternal zip code. We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between an interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutants and very preterm (VPTB, 20-34 weeks), moderate preterm (MPTB, 34-36 weeks) and early term births (ETB, 37-38 weeks). We adjusted all models for co-pollutants and meteorological factors.  Results:   During warm seasons (May-October), an IQR increase in ozone was associated with 9-11% increased odds of VPTB from lag 0 (ORlag0 1.09, 95% CI 1.04,1.16) to lag 7 (ORlag7 1.11, 95% CI 1.04,1.16). Findings were consistent for MPTB and ETB. Ozone was potentially responsible for an excess of 3-6 VPTBs, 7-9 PTBs and 24-42 ETBs per 1,000 singleton deliveries. During cold seasons (November-April), increased PM2.5 exposure was associated with 5-6% increased odds of VPTB beginning at lag 3 (ORlag3 1.06, 95% CI 1.02,1.11). PM2.5 was associated with an excess of 1-3 VPTBs, 0-3 MPTBs and 6-18 ETBs per 1,000 singleton deliveries.  Conclusions:   PM2.5 and ozone are associated with increased risk of VPTB, MPTB and ETB within one week of exposure and are potential contributors to the increasing PTB trend.

Materials and methods:   One-hundred-and-eighty individuals with a lung nodule on their baseline LDCT lung cancer screening scan were randomly mixed with screenees without nodules in a 1:1 ratio (total: 360 individuals). All scans were assessed by double reading and subsequently processed by an academic DL-CAD system. The findings of double reading and the DL-CAD system were then evaluated by two senior radiologists to derive the reference standard. The detection performance was evaluated by the Free Response Operating Characteristic curve, sensitivity and false-positive (FP) rate. The senior radiologists categorized nodules according to nodule diameter, type (solid, part-solid, non-solid) and Lung-RADS.  Results:   The reference standard consisted of 262 nodules ≥ 4 mm in 196 individuals; 359 findings were considered false positives. The DL-CAD system achieved a sensitivity of 90.1% with 1.0 FP/scan for detection of lung nodules regardless of size or type, whereas double reading had a sensitivity of 76.0% with 0.04 FP/scan (P = 0.001). The sensitivity for detection of nodules ≥ 4 - ≤ 6 mm was significantly higher with DL-CAD than with double reading (86.3% vs. 58.9% respectively; P = 0.001). Sixty-three nodules were only identified by the DL-CAD system, and 27 nodules only found by double reading. The DL-CAD system reached similar performance compared to double reading in Lung-RADS 3 (94.3% vs. 90.0%, P = 0.549) and Lung-RADS 4 nodules (100.0% vs. 97.0%, P = 1.000), but showed a higher sensitivity in Lung-RADS 2 (86.2% vs. 65.4%, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The DL-CAD system can accurately detect pulmonary nodules on LDCT, with an acceptable false-positive rate of 1 nodule per scan and has higher detection performance than double reading.

Methods: Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy/immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved. Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed. Results: A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated. COVID-19 was asymptomatic/mild in 44 patients and moderate/severe/critical in 31 patients. Based on allergy evaluation, allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients (25.3%), asthma in 10 patients (13%), and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients (4%).

However, previous studies have produced divergent results regarding protective or damaging immunity induced by prior sCoV exposure. It remains unknown whether pre-existing humoral immunity plays a role in vaccine-induced neutralization and antibody responses. In this study, we collected 36 paired sera samples from 36 healthy volunteers before and after immunization with inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for COVID-19, and analyzed the distribution and intensity of pre-existing antibody responses at the epitope level pre-vaccination as well as the relationship between pre-existing sCoV immunity and vaccine-induced neutralization. We observed large amounts of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies in the conserved regions among sCoVs, especially the S2 subunit. Excep t for a few peptides, the IgG and IgM fluorescence intensities against S, M and N peptides did not differ significantly between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination sera of vaccinees who developed a neutralization inhibition rate (%inhibition) <40 and %inhibition ≥40 after two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants with strong and weak pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies (strong pre-CRA; weak pre-CRA) had similar %inhibition pre-vaccination (10.9% ± 2.9% vs. 12.0% ± 2.2%, P=0.990) and post-vaccination (43.8% ± 25.1% vs. 44.6% ± 21.5%, P=0.997). Overall, the strong pre-CRA group did not show a significantly greater increase in antibody responses to the S protein linear peptides post-vaccination compared with the weak pre-CRA group.

This is an epidemiological websurvey, carried out from August to September 2020. Teachers from public schools in rural and urban areas in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, participated in the study. A digital questionnaire was used and the study addressed variables related to four major thematic topics: sociodemographic and economic profile, working conditions, lifestyle and health conditions, and mental health problems during the pandemic. The sample consisted of 15,641 teachers, of which 13.3% worked in rural areas, 81.9% were women, 56.2% were aged 41-60 years, 66.8% were married, 99.2% were working remotely and 79.8% adhered to social distancing. During the pandemic, 40.6% showed a decrease in family income, 33.7% were dissatisfied with their work, 58% reported increased body weight, 47.9% did not exercise, 35.8% were part of at least one risk group for COVID-19, 40.5% had some flu-like symptoms during the pandemic and 1.2% tested positive for COVID-19. Regarding mental health problems, 25.9% of teachers self-reported formal diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression during the pandemic. In addition, 7.1% of teachers were drinking more alcohol than usual, 33.4% started having sleep problems, 30.4% were using relax/sleep/anxiety/depression medications, 67.1% reported that their quality of life worsened and 43.7% reported having severe fear of COVID-19. It was also found that 82.3% of teachers had at least one mental health problem during the pandemic, such as increased alcohol consumption, sleep problems, use of psychotropic medication, decreased quality of life, and fear of COVID-19.

Intracellular metabolic pathways direct the macrophage inflammatory response, however whether the clock is impacting intracellular metabolism to direct this response is unclear. Specific metabolic reprogramming of macrophages controls the production of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We now describe that the macrophage molecular clock, through Bmal1, regulates the uptake of glucose, its flux through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, including the production of the metabolite succinate to drive Il-1β production. We further demonstrate that BMAL1 modulates the level and localisation of the glycolytic enzyme PKM2, which in turn activates STAT3 to further drive Il-1β mRNA expression. Overall, this work demonstrates that BMAL1 is a key metabolic sensor in macrophages, and its deficiency leads to a metabolic shift of enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, leading to a heightened pro-inflammatory state. These data provide insight into the control of macrophage driven inflammation by the molecular clock, and the potential for time-based therapeutics against a range of chronic inflammatory diseases.""","""['George A Timmons', 'Richard G Carroll', ""James R O'Siorain"", 'Mariana P Cervantes-Silva', 'Lauren E Fagan', 'Shannon L Cox', 'Eva Palsson-McDermott', 'David K Finlay', 'Emma E Vincent', 'Nicholas Jones', 'Annie M Curtis']""","""[' School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences and Tissue Engineering Research Group, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', ' School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Science Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ' Medical Research Council (MRC) Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', ' Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', ' Institute of Life Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea, United Kingdom.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Front Immunol""","""['Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates IL-1β in macrophages via NRF2.', 'Rewiring of Lactate-Interleukin-1β Autoregulatory Loop with Clock-Bmal1: a Feed-Forward Circuit in Glioma.', 'REV-ERBα agonist SR9009 suppresses IL-1β production in macrophages through BMAL1-dependent inhibition of inflammasome.', 'Potential Roles of Dec and Bmal1 Genes in Interconnecting Circadian Clock and Energy Metabolism.', 'The functional significance of the skeletal muscle clock: lessons from Bmal1 knockout models.', 'Dual-Targeted Nanodiscs Revealing the Cross-Talk between Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Macrophages.', 'Neural function of Bmal1: an overview.', 'BMAL1/FOXA2-induced rhythmic fluctuations in IL-6 contribute to nocturnal asthma attacks.', 'PPARγ (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ) Deacetylation Suppresses Aging-Associated Atherosclerosis and Hypercholesterolemia.', 'Establishment of a platform for measuring mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate for cardiac mitochondrial toxicity.']"""

Autoantibodies are the biomarkers of the condition, precede overt disease and determine disease phenotypes. SSc specific autoantibodies also vary between racial groupings. Objective: To investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Zimbabwean patients who were reactive SSc specific autoantibodies.  Materials and method:   240 patients, 173 of them female with SSc specific autoantibodies were included. Autoantibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting using a panel of 13 SScl (Euroimmun Ag., Germany). Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters relevant to the monitoring of SScl were captured. These included pulmonary function tests, hematology, clinical chemistry, serology and thyroid function tests. Allergy skin prick tests (SPT) to inhalant and food allergen sources were conducted when indicated.  Results:   All the 240 patients (median age was 36 years) expressed SSc specific autoantibodies. 86% were Black, 11% White and 3% Asian and a fifth (20%) were younger than 16 years. Eleven (4.6%) fulfilled the ACR/EULAR classification of SSc. Clinically they had limited cutaneous (n=6), diffuse cutaneous (n=3) and SScl/inflammatory myopathy overlap (n=2). The most frequently detected antibodies anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAP) 55%, anti-Th/To (28%) anti-RNAP 11 (22%), anti-CENPB (18%) and anti-Scl-70/ATA (13%). Racial variations in the expression of these antibodies were apparent between Black, White and Asian patients. The majority (95%), who did not fulfil the ARA/EULAR criteria were symptomatic. Raynaud's Phenomenon was documented in 24%. Respiratory symptoms included coughing, dyspnea and wheezing. There was a restrictive ventilatory defect with increased FEV1/FVC ratio. Pruritus, urticaria and skin depigmentation were the main cutaneous features while constipation, bloating, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and abdominal pain dominated GI symptoms. Mean blood pressure readings while normal varied with biomarkers. Haematology and biochemistry parameters were within normal reference ranges.  Conclusion:   The expression of SSc specific autoantibodies is common and associated with known SSc symptoms. The types and frequency of autoantibodies varied with racial groupings.

However, these drugs are less effective against Trichuris trichiura. Combined ivermectin-albendazole is a promising treatment alternative, yet robust evidence is lacking. We aimed to demonstrate superiority of co-administered ivermectin-albendazole over albendazole monotherapy in three distinct epidemiological settings.  Methods:   We conducted a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, randomised controlled trial in community members aged 6-60 years infected with T trichiura in Côte d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, Tanzania, between Sept 26, 2018, and June 29, 2020. Participants with at least 100 T trichiura eggs per g of stool at baseline were randomly assigned (1:1) using computer-generated randomisation sequences in varying blocks of four, six, and eight, stratified by baseline T trichiura infection intensity, to orally receive either a single dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) plus albendazole (400 mg) or albendazole (400 mg) plus placebo. Patients, field staff, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was cure rate against T trichiura, defined as the proportion of participants with no eggs in their faeces 14-21 days after treatment, assessed by Kato-Katz thick smears, and analysed in the available-case population according to intention-to-treat principles. Safety was a secondary outcome and was assessed 3 h and 24 h after drug administration. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03527732.  Findings:   Between Sept 13 and Dec 18, 2019, Jan 12 and April 5, 2019, and Sept 26 and Nov 5, 2018, 3737, 3694, and 1435 community members were screened for trial eligibility in Côte d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively. In Côte d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, 256, 274, and 305 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned to the albendazole group, and 255, 275, and 308, respectively, to the ivermectin-albendazole group. Primary outcome data were available for 722 participants treated with albendazole and 733 treated with ivermectin-albendazole. Ivermectin-albendazole showed significantly higher cure rates against T trichiura than albendazole in Laos (66% [140 of 213]vs 8% [16 of 194]; difference 58 percentage points, 95% CI 50 to 65, p<0·0001) and Pemba Island (49% [140 of 288]vs 6% [18 of 293], 43 percentage points, 36 to 49, p<0·0001) but had similar efficacy in Côte d'Ivoire (14% [32 of 232]vs 10% [24 of 235], 4 percentage points, -2 to 10, p=0·24). No serious adverse events were reported; observed events were mostly classified as mild (95% [266 of 279] in the albendazole group and 91% [288 of 317] in the ivermectin-albendazole group), and all were transient in nature.  Interpretation:   Treatment with ivermectin-albendazole resulted in higher efficacy against trichuriasis than albendazole alone in Laos and Pemba Island but not in Côte d'Ivoire. We recommend implementation of this combination therapy for soil-transmitted helminth control in countries with high T trichiura prevalence and proven enhanced efficacy of this treatment, particularly where ivermectin is beneficial against other endemic helminthiases.

Generalised additive models and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationships. A subgroup analysis was conducted in early-mid pubertal and late-post pubertal groups. Age, height, weight, physical activity, intake of dietary protein and/or stage of puberty were adjusted. TT and FT were positively related to FFM and handgrip strength, with a curvilinear relationship being detected for handgrip strength (p<0.050). This curvilinear relationship was only observed in the late-post pubertal group, suggesting a potential threshold effect (FT>11.99ng/dL, β = 1.275, p = 0.039).

Secondarily we aimed to describe the clubfoot population with respect to sex, laterality, severity of deformity, comorbidity and geographic location.  Methods:   A national register, the Swedish Pediatric Orthopedic Quality register, was used to extract data on newborn children with clubfoot. To calculate the birth prevalence of children with isolated or non-isolated clubfoot between 1st of January 2016 and 31st of December 2019, we used official reports of the total number of Swedish live births from the Swedish Board of Statistics. The Pirani score and predefined signs of atypical clubfoot were used to classify clubfoot severity at birth.  Results:   In total 612 children with clubfoot were identified. Of these, 564 were children with isolated clubfoot, generating a birth prevalence of 1.24/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.35). About 8% were children with non-isolated clubfoot, increasing the birth prevalence to 1.35/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.46). Of the children with isolated clubfoot, 74% were boys and 47% had bilateral involvement. The children with non-isolated clubfoot had more severe foot deformities at birth and a greater proportion of clubfeet with atypical signs compared with children with isolated clubfoot.  Conclusion:   We have established the birth prevalence of children born with isolated or non-isolated clubfoot in Sweden based on data from a national register. Moreover, we have estimated the number of children born with atypical clubfeet in instances of both isolated and non-isolated clubfoot.

Age-related executive function deficits are common in older smokers; however, the association of depression and nicotine dependence on executive function has not been explored. This study addressed whether depression and nicotine dependence are related to executive dysfunction in rural older adult smokers.  Methods:   The sample included 40 rural older adults recruited from two primary care clinics in North Carolina. Executive function was evaluated with the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI), Metacognition Index, and Global Executive Composite (GEC) T scores from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult. Nicotine dependence and depression symptoms were assessed using the Fagerstrom Test and Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale-10, respectively. Analysis of variance was used to explore whether depression and/or nicotine dependence influences executive function. Nondirectional tests were performed with significance set at .10.  Results:   Smokers who screened positive for depression had significantly greater executive dysfunction than those who did not (BRI: p = .0003, Metacognition Index: p < .0001, GEC: p < .0001), and moderate/high dependence was associated with greater executive function deficits compared with those with mild dependence (BRI: p = .0942). Together, depression and nicotine dependence explained 50% of the variability of the GEC overall scores.  Conclusions:   Executive dysfunction is common in rural older adult smokers and associated with depression and nicotine dependence severity. Futures studies should test the relationship of executive function and smoking cessation in the older adult population as it may have implications for cessation in this population.""","""['Devon Noonan', 'Nikolas J Silva', 'Shawn M McClintock', 'Susan G Silva']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""J Addict Nurs""","""['Predicting smoking cessation and major depression in nicotine-dependent smokers.', 'Assessment of nicotine dependence among smokers in a selected rural population in Kerala, India.', 'Differences in quality of life among older adults in Brazil according to smoking status and nicotine dependence.', 'Nicotine dependence and depression among women smokers on methadone maintenance.', 'Co-morbid tobacco use disorder and depression: A re-evaluation of smoking cessation therapy in depressed smokers.']"""

However, HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has been a major challenge for the current treatment of HIV/AIDS in China.  Methods:   In the current study, we established a nested dynamic model to predict the multi-drug resistance dynamics of HIV among the heterosexual population and evaluated the impact of intervention measures on the transmission of drug resistance. We obtained an effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] from each sub-model held at different stages of the dynamic model. Meanwhile, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic methods to infer the weighted average effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] from four HIV subtypes that sampled from 912 HIV-positive patients in China. It is an original and innovative method by fitting [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to generate unknown parameters in [Formula: see text].  Results:   By analyzing the HIV gene sequences, we inferred that the most recent common ancestor of CRF01AE, CRF07BC, CRF08BC, and CRFBC dated from 1994, 1990, 1993 and 1990, respectively. The weighted average effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] dropped from 1.95 in 1994 to 1.73 in 2018. Considering different interventions, we used a macro dynamic model to predict the trend of HIV resistance. The results show that the number of new infections and total drug resistance under the baseline parameter (S1) are 253,422 and 213,250 in 2025, respectively. Comparing with the numbers under the target treatment rate (S2), they were 219,717 and 236,890, respectively. However, under the ideal treatment target (S3, the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%), the number of new infections shows a declining trend and will decrease to 46,559 by 2025. Compared with S1 and S2, the total number of resistance also decreased to 160,899 in 2025.  Conclusion:   With the promotion of NFATP in China, HIV resistance to ARVs is inevitable. The strategy of increasing the treatment rate would not only ineffectively curb the epidemic, but also deteriorate drug resistance issue. Whereas, a combination of intervention strategies (the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%) can greatly reduce both infection and drug resistance rate than applying one strategy alone.""","""['Xin Jin', 'Zhen Wang', 'Zhiyuan Zhang', 'Hui Wu', 'Yuhua Ruan', 'Chen Zhang', 'Ruihua Kang', 'Hui Xing', 'Jie Lou']""","""[' Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.', ' State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', ' School of Nursing, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', ' Department of Disease Prevention and Control, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""PLoS One""","""['HIV-1 is spreading out of former high-risk population through heterosexual transmission in Hebei, China.', 'Analysis on HIV-1 subtypes and transmission clusters in newly reported HIV/AIDS cases in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, 2016.', 'Prevalence and evolution of drug resistance HIV-1 variants in Henan, China.', 'Study of the impact of HIV genotypic drug resistance testing on therapy efficacy.', 'Genotypic and Phylogenetic Insights on Prevention of the Spread of HIV-1 and Drug Resistance in ""Real-World"" Settings.']"""

Methods:   We used quasi-Poisson distributed lag non-linear models to estimate the effect of high temperature-measured as the 95th percentile of daily minimum, mean and maximum compared with the median-on risk of spontaneous preterm birth (23-36 weeks of gestation) in pregnant women in New South Wales, Australia.

Results:   Pregnant women (n = 916,678) exposed at the 95th percentile of daily mean temperatures (25ºC) had an increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.07, 1.21) compared with the median daily mean temperature (17℃). Similar effect sizes were seen for the 95th percentile of minimum and maximum daily temperatures compared with the median.

Methods:   Adults aged ≥ 65 years who participated in the senior health checkup program at National Taiwan University Hospital during 2011-2013 were recruited (N = 467 at baseline). The participants were followed after 4 years and 6 years. MetS was assessed at baseline. Successful aging was evaluated at baseline, 4-year follow-up, and 6-year follow-up. We adopted an extended definition of successful aging, which was defined as three major domains: physiological, psychological, and sociological and economic domains. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the association between MetS and successful aging adjusting for time (follow-up years), age, sex, years of education, alcohol consumption and MetS×time interaction term.  Results:   The mean age of the study population was 72.9 (SD 5.5) years. The absence of baseline MetS had a positive effect on the probability of successful aging over six years. The absences of abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertension were associated with the physiological successful aging. The absence of hypertension was the most significant predictor of physiological successful aging [aOR (95% CI) = 2.76 (1.67-4.58), p<0.001].

A serious game coupled with a classroom session led by lived experience workers (LEWs) might help to overcome these barriers. The school-based Strong Teens and Resilient Minds (STORM) preventive program employed this strategy and offered a serious game, Moving Stories. The current study was carried out to assess inhibiting and promoting factors for scaling up Moving Stories once its effectiveness has been ascertained.  Methods:   Moving Stories was offered in three steps: (1) introductory classroom session, (2) students playing the game for five days, (3) debriefing classroom session led by lived experience worker. Data was collected on the number of participating students, costs of offering Moving Stories, and was further based on the notes of the debriefing sessions to check if mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies were addressed.  Results:   Moving Stories was offered in seven high-schools. Coverage was moderate with 982 participating students out of 1880 (52%). Most participating students (83%) played the Moving Stories app three out of the five days. Qualitative data showed that the MHFAs were discussed in all debriefing sessions. Students showed great interest in lived experience workers' stories and shared their own experiences with depression.  Conclusions:   Bringing Moving Stories to scale in the high-school setting appears feasible, but will remain logistically somewhat challenging. Future implementation and scale-up of Moving Stories could benefit from improved selection and training of LEWs that played such an important role in grabbing the full attention of students and were able to launch frank discussions about depressive disorder and stigma in classrooms.

The incidence and transmission of blaKPC-2 gene via horizontal gene transfer (e.g. transposition) have been well documented. However, the dynamics of transposon structure bearing blaKPC-2 and their exact effects on the evolution and dissemination of blaKPC-2 gene are not well characterized. Here, we collected all 161 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates during the early stage of CRE pandemic. We observed that the prevalence of KPC-2-producing Enterobacterales was mediated by multiple species and sequence types (STs), and that blaKPC-2 gene was located on three diverse variants of Tn1721 in multi-drug resistance (MDR) region of plasmid. Notably, the outbreak of KPC-2-producing plasmid is correlated with the dynamics of transposon structure. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrated that replicative transposition of Tn1721 and IS26 promotes horizontal transfer of blaKPC-2 and the evolution of KPC-2-producing plasmid. The Tn1721 variants appearing concurrently with the peak of an epidemic (A2- and B-type) showed higher transposition frequencies and a certain superior ability to propagation. Overall, our work suggests replicative transposition contributes to the evolution and transmission of KPC-2-producing plasmid and highlights its important role in the inter- and intra-species dissemination of blaKPC-2 gene in Enterobacterales.""","""['Yu Tang', 'Gang Li', 'Pinghua Shen', 'Ying Zhang', 'Xiaofei Jiang']""","""["" Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Laboratory Medicine, Jinshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Laboratory Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Emerg Microbes Infect""","""['Covert dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) in a successfully controlled outbreak: long- and short-read whole-genome sequencing demonstrate multiple genetic modes of transmission.', 'Molecular dissection of an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae reveals Intergenus KPC carbapenemase transmission through a promiscuous plasmid.', 'Co-occurrence of a novel VIM-1 and FosA3-encoding multidrug-resistant plasmid and a KPC-2-encoding pKP048-like plasmid in a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 11.', 'Anti-Restriction Protein, KlcAHS, Promotes Dissemination of Carbapenem Resistance.', 'Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: molecular and genetic decoding.']"""

The aim of the present study was to identify potential risk factors significantly associated with SCH, relative to a BD reference group.  Methods:   Data were obtained from medical records of patients that entered a major Mexico City hospital during 2009-2010 presenting psychotic symptoms (n = 1132; 830 cases of SCH, 302 cases of BD; 714 men and 418 women). SCH and BD diagnoses were compared with respect to a number of family and clinical characteristics. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to respectively identify factors selectively associated with the SCH diagnosis relative to the BD diagnosis and explore the relationship between PANSS scores and parental age at time of birth to the age of SCH onset.  Results:   Patients with SCH showed greater functional impairment than those with BD. Family history of mental illness, premorbid schizoid-like personality, and obstetric trauma were significantly associated with the SCH diagnosis. The association of obstetric trauma with SCH was greatest in male patients with a family history of mental illness. In women, increased paternal and decreased maternal age at time of the patient's birth were associated with an earlier age of SCH onset.  Conclusion:   Male gender, showing premorbid schizoid-like personality, familial SCH, and obstetric trauma are risk factors that distinguish SCH from BD. Additionally, our results suggest that risk for SCH relative to BD may be importantly influenced by interactions between familial risk, gender, and obstetric trauma.""","""['Lina Díaz-Castro', 'Kurt Hoffman', 'Héctor Cabello-Rangel', 'Armando Arredondo', 'Miguel Ángel Herrera-Estrella']""","""[' Research in Medical Sciences, Direction of Epidemiological and Psychosocial Research, 42584National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muñiz, Mexico City, Mexico.', ' Carlos Beyer Center for Investigation of Animal Reproduction (CIRA), Autonomous University of Tlaxcala and Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnical Institute (UATx - CINVESTAV), Tlaxcala, Mexico.', ' Research in Health Systems, Diagnostic Auxiliary Division, 428841Psychiatric Hospital Fray Bernardino Álvarez, Mexico City, Mexico.', ' Research in Medical Sciences, Health Systems Research Center, National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', ' Medical Doctor, Hospitalization Services, 428841Psychiatric Hospital Fray Bernardino Álvarez, Mexico City, Mexico.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Inquiry""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'Gut microbial signatures and differences in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia of emerging adulthood.', 'Review of Standard Laboratory Blood Parameters in Patients with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.', 'Group and sex differences in social cognition in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and healthy people.', 'Regulation of inflammatory pathways in schizophrenia: A comparative study with bipolar disorder and healthy controls.']"""

In the UK, penicillin is administered to patients in primary care whilst third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, are administered in secondary care. The first-choice antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is ciprofloxacin, followed by rifampicin. Immunocompromised individuals are often recommended antibiotic chemoprophylaxis and vaccination due to a greater risk of IMD. Resistance to antibiotics among meningococci is relatively rare, however reduced susceptibility and resistance to penicillin are increasing globally. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins is seldom reported, however reduced susceptibility to both cefotaxime and ceftriaxone has been observed. Rifampicin resistance has been reported among meningococci, mainly following prophylaxis, and ciprofloxacin resistance, whilst uncommon, has also been reported across the globe. The Public Health England Meningococcal Reference Unit receives and characterises the majority of isolates from IMD cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This study assessed the distribution of antibiotic resistance to penicillin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime among IMD isolates received at the MRU from 2010/11 to 2018/19 (n = 4,122). Out of the 4,122 IMD isolates, 113 were penicillin-resistant, five were ciprofloxacin-resistant, two were rifampicin-resistant, and one was cefotaxime-resistant. Penicillin resistance was due to altered penA alleles whilst rifampicin and ciprofloxacin resistance was due to altered rpoB and gyrA alleles, respectively. Cefotaxime resistance was observed in one isolate which had an altered penA allele containing additional mutations to those harboured by the penicillin-resistant isolates. This study identified several isolates with resistance to antibiotics used for current treatment and prophylaxis of IMD and highlights the need for continued surveillance of resistance among meningococci to ensure continued effective use.""","""['Laura Willerton', 'Jay Lucidarme', 'Andrew Walker', 'Aiswarya Lekshmi', 'Stephen A Clark', 'Lloyd Walsh', 'Xilian Bai', 'Lisa Lee-Jones', 'Ray Borrow']""","""[' Meningococcal Reference Unit, Public Health England, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ' Life Sciences Department, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Penicillin- and Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Invasive Neisseria meningitidis Isolates from Japan.', 'Antibiotic susceptibility and molecular analysis of invasive Neisseria meningitidis recovered in the Republic of Ireland, 1996 to 2016.', 'Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated from invasive cases in Brazil from 2009 to 2016.', 'Detection of Ciprofloxacin-Resistant, β-Lactamase-Producing Neisseria meningitidis Serogroup Y Isolates - United States, 2019-2020.', 'Emergence and spread of resistant N. meningitidis implicated in invasive meningococcal diseases during the past decade (2008-2017).', 'Penicillin and Cefotaxime Resistance of Quinolone-Resistant Neisseria meningitidis Clonal Complex 4821, Shanghai, China, 1965-2020.', 'Carriage of Neisseria meningitidis Among Umrah Pilgrims: Circulating Serogroups and Antibiotic Resistance.', 'Penicillin- and Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Invasive Neisseria meningitidis Isolates from Japan.']"""

The aim of this study was to examine provider knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding RDT use and their relationship to antibiotic prescribing decisions across multiple clinical departments in an urban safety-net hospital.  Methods:   We conducted a mixed methods sequential explanatory study. Providers with prescribing authority (attending physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants) who had at least 20 RTI encounters from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Eighty-five providers completed surveys and 16 participated in interviews. We conducted electronic surveys via RedCap from April to July 2019, followed by semi-structured individual interviews from October to December 2019, to ascertain knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to RDT use and antibiotic prescribing.  Results:   Survey findings indicated that providers felt knowledgeable about antibiotic prescribing guidelines. They reported high familiarity with the rapid streptococcus and rapid influenza tests. Familiarity with comprehensive respiratory panel PCR (RPP-respiratory panel PCR) and procalcitonin differed by clinical department. Qualitative interviews identified four main themes: providers trust their clinical judgment more than rapid test results; patient-provider relationships play an important role in prescribing decisions; there is patient demand for antibiotics and providers employ different strategies to address the demand and providers do not believe RDTs are implemented with sufficient education or evidence for clinical practice.  Conclusion:   Prescribers are knowledgeable about prescribing guidelines but often rely on clinical judgement to make final decisions. The utility of RDTs is specific to the type of RDT and the clinical department. Given the low familiarity and clinical utility of RPP and procalcitonin, providers may require additional education and these tests may need to be implemented differently based on clinical department.""","""['Shana A B Burrowes', 'Tamar F Barlam', 'Alexandra Skinner', 'Rebecca Berger', 'Pengsheng Ni', 'Mari-Lynn Drainoni']""","""[' Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ' Department of Health Law Policy and Management, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ' Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ' Biostatistics and Epidemiology Data Analytics Center (BEDAC) Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ' Evans Center for Implementation and Improvement Sciences (CIIS), Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States of America.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Variability in Antibiotic Prescribing for Upper Respiratory Illnesses by Provider Specialty.', 'Not a magic pill: a qualitative exploration of provider perspectives on antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting.', 'Attitudes of High Versus Low Antibiotic Prescribers in the Management of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections: a Mixed Methods Study.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Prescription of Controlled Substances: Benefits and Risks.', 'Diagnostic Stewardship as a Team Sport: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Improved Implementation of Interventions and Effect Measurement.']"""

The aim of the present study is to analyze the physiological and pathological motion in odontoid fractures and to assess limitation of motion in the cervical spine when applying a cervical collar.  Methods:   Motion analysis was performed with wireless motion tracker on unfixed geriatric human cadavers. First, a new geriatric type II odontoid fracture model was developed. In this model, the type II odontoid fracture is operated via a transoral approach. The physiological and pathological flexion and lateral bending of the cervical spine resulting from this procedure was measured. The resulting motion after external stabilization using a cervical collar was analyzed.  Results:   The new geriatric type II odontoid fracture model was successfully established using seven unfixed human cadavers. The pathological flexion of the cervical spine was significantly increased compared to the physiological flexion (p = 0.027). Furthermore, the flexion was significantly reduced when a cervical collar was applied. In case of flexion the mean remaining motion was significantly reduced (p = 0.0017) from 41° to 14°. For lateral bending the mean remaining motion was significantly reduced (p = 0.0137) from 48° to 18°.  Conclusions:   In case of type II odontoid fracture, flexion and lateral bending of the cervical spine are increased due to spinal instability. Thus, if an odontoid fracture is suspected in geriatric patients, the application of a cervical collar should always be considered since external stabilization can significantly reduce flexion and lateral bending.""","""['Matthias K Jung', 'Gregor V R von Ehrlich-Treuenstätt', 'Andreas L Jung', 'Holger Keil', 'Paul A Grützner', 'Niko R E Schneider', 'Michael Kreinest']""","""[' BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen, Clinic for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Ludwigshafen on the Rhine, Germany.', ' Clinic for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', ' Clinic of Anesthesiology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Biomechanical contributions of upper cervical ligamentous structures in Type II odontoid fractures.', 'Range of motion in the cervical spine after odontoid fracture treated with anterior screw fixation.', 'The stabilizing effects of different orthoses in the intact and unstable upper cervical spine: a cadaver study.', 'Treatment of displaced type II odontoid fractures in elderly patients.', 'Temporary fusionless posterior occipitocervical fixation for a proximal junctional type II odontoid fracture after previous C2-pelvis fusion: case report, description of a new surgical technique, and review of the literature.']"""

Different mosquito species display various behaviors, breeding sites, and geographic distribution; however, they can be difficult to distinguish in the field due to morphological similarities between species and damage caused during trapping and transportation. Vector control methods for controlling mosquito-borne disease epidemics require an understanding of which vector species are present in the area as well as the epidemiological patterns of disease transmission. Although molecular techniques can accurately distinguish between mosquito species, they are costly and laborious, making them unsuitable for extensive use in the field. Thus, alternative techniques are required. Geometric morphometrics (GM) is a rapid and inexpensive technique that can be used to analyze the size, shape, and shape variation of individuals based on a range of traits. Here, we used GM to analyze the wings of 1,040 female mosquitoes from 12 different species in Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, imaged microscopically, and digitized using 17 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species was analyzed using canonical variate analysis (CVA), while discriminant function analysis was used to cross-validate classification reliability based on Mahalanobis distances. Phenetic relationships were constructed to illustrate the discrimination patterns for genera and species. CVA of the morphological variation among Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex, and Mansonia mosquito genera revealed five clusters. In particular, we demonstrated a high percentage of correctly-distinguished samples among Aedes (97.48%), Armigeres (96.15%), Culex (90.07%), and Mansonia (91.67%), but not Anopheles (64.54%).

Moreover, exclusive haplotypes according to clinical origin and geographical area were found. S1/P. brasiliensis (HD = 0.655 and K = 4.613) and P. lutzii (HD = 0.649 and K = 2.906) presented the highest rate of polymorphism among all species, from which 12 isolates of the present study were clustered within S1b/P. brasiliensis. The GP43 locus showed a higher variability and was found to be the main reason for the species differentiation.  Conclusions:   The results herein decribed show a high intraspecific genetic variability among S1/P. brasiliensis isolates and confirm the predominance of this species in the Southeast region of Brazil. The finding of exclusive haplotypes according to clinical origin and geographical area would suggest correlation between the molecular profile with the clinical form and geographic origin of patients with PCM.""","""['Juliana Andrade-Silva', 'Leonardo Euripedes Andrade-Silva', 'Hugo Costa Paes', 'Lucas Alves', 'Adair Rosa', 'Bernardo Guerra Tenório', 'Marcelo Simão Ferreira', 'Maria Sueli Soares Felipe', 'Marcus de Melo Teixeira', 'Mario León Silva-Vergara']""","""[' Infectious Diseases Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Triangulo Mineiro Federal University, Uberaba, Brazil.', ' Faculty of Medicina, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.', ' Infectious diseases Unit, Internal Medicine Department Federal University of Uberlândia, Uberlândia, Brazil.', ' Graduate Program in Genomic Sciences, Catholic University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS Negl Trop Dis""","""['An update on the occurrence of Paracoccidioides species in the Midwest region, Brazil: Molecular epidemiology, clinical aspects and serological profile of patients from Mato Grosso do Sul State.', 'IgG reactivity profile to Paracoccidioides spp. antigens in people with asymptomatic Paracoccidioidomycosis.', 'Occurrence of Paracoccidioides lutzii in the Amazon region: description of two cases.', 'Characterization of a Paracoccidioides spp. strain from southeastern Brazil genotyped as Paracoccidioides restrepiensis (PS3) and review of this phylogenetic species.', 'Phylogenetic Species of Paracoccidioides spp. Isolated from Clinical and Environmental Samples in a Hyperendemic Area of Paracoccidioidomycosis in Southeastern Brazil.']"""

Methods:   The analytical sample included nine participants with WS (four men, five women, 49.6 ± 9.3 years, SD). The height-corrected appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), upper- and lower-limb muscle mass index (USMI/LSMI) of the patients with WS were compared with the Japanese reference data (40-79 years). The body mass index, SMI, height-corrected fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) were compared with the reference data of Japanese older adults (65-94 years). The SMIs of WS were also compared with the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia.  Results:   The SMI and USMI/LSMI of all participants with WS were lower than the Japanese reference data corresponding to gender and age, and the rate of decrease was more pronounced for USMI than for LSMI. The body mass index, SMI and FFMI for all the WS cases were lower than those for the older Japanese, while the FMI was higher in men with WS but lower in women than the reference data of the older Japanese. The SMI was below the cut-off value for the diagnosis of sarcopenia in all patients with WS.  Conclusion:   The SMI for WS is comparable with that for sarcopenia and significantly lower than that for healthy individuals of the same age and older adults. The USMI was significantly lower than LSMI in patients with WS, and FMI was higher in male patients with WS and lower in women than in healthy older people.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a common ambient air pollutant that can cause adverse effects on the heart. CO is known to cause tissue ischemia, resulting in ventricular arrhythmias. However, accumulating biological studies showed that CO could exert effects on multiple cardiac ionic channels under normoxic conditions, which might indicate new proarrhythmic mechanisms other than ischemia-mediated electrophysiology changes. In this work, we evaluated the functional impacts of CO on human ventricles using a multi-scale model of human ventricular tissue. Experimental data regarding the effects of CO on different ion channels were incorporated into the cell model to explore the alterations of ventricular electrophysiology. Simulation results suggested that CO significantly prolonged the duration of ventricular action potentials, enhanced the transmural dispersion of repolarization, and reduced the adaptability of ventricular tissue to fast heart rates. In addition, simulated pseudo-ECGs showed consistent manifestations with the clinical observation that CO caused an apparent QT interval prolongation and T-wave widening, indicating that CO affected the heart's abnormal ventricular repolarization.""","""['Huasen Jiang', 'Shugang Zhang', 'Xiangpeng Bi', 'Wenjian Ma', 'Zhiqiang Wei']""","""[' College of Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266100, China.', ' College of Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266100, China.

Nevertheless, manufacturers doubt whether there will be a market for new antimicrobial technologies sufficient to enable them to recoup their investment. Health technology assessment (HTA) has a critical role in creating confidence that if valuable technologies can be developed they will be reimbursed at a level that captures their true value. We identify 3 deficiencies of current HTA processes for appraising antimicrobial agents: a methods-centric approach rather than problem-centric approach for dealing with new challenges, a lack of tools for thinking about changing patterns of infection, and the absence of an approach to epidemiological risks. We argue that, to play their role more effectively, HTA agencies need to broaden their methodological tool kit, design and communicate their analysis to a wider set of users, and incorporate long-term policy goals, such as containing resistance, as part of their evaluation criteria alongside immediate health gains.""","""['Abigail R Colson', 'Alec Morton', 'Christine Årdal', 'Kalipso Chalkidou', 'Sally C Davies', 'Louis P Garrison', 'Mark Jit', 'Ramanan Laxminarayan', 'Itamar Megiddo', 'Chantal Morel', 'Justice Nonvignon', 'Kevin Outterson', 'John H Rex', 'Abdur Razzaque Sarker', 'Mark Sculpher', 'Beth Woods', 'Yue Xiao']""","""[' Management Science, Strathclyde Business School, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.

However, little is known about the causes of premature mortality in the country. To rectify this, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone launched the Sierra Leone Sample Registration System (SL-SRS) of births and deaths. Here, we report cause-specific mortality from the first SL-SRS round, representing deaths from 2018 to 2020.  Methods:   The Countrywide Mortality Surveillance for Action platform established the SL-SRS, which involved conducting electronic verbal autopsies in 678 randomly selected villages and urban blocks throughout the country. 61 surveyors, in teams of four or five, enrolled people and ascertained deaths of individuals younger than 70 years in 2019-20, capturing verbal autopsies on deaths from 2018 to 2020. Centrally, two trained physicians independently assigned causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases (tenth edition). SL-SRS death proportions were applied to 5-year mortality averages from the UN World Population Prospects (2019) to derive cause-specific death totals and risks of death nationally and in four Sierra Leone regions, with comparisons made with the Western region where Freetown, the capital, is located. We compared SL-SRS results with the cause-specific mortality estimates for Sierra Leone in the 2019 WHO Global Health Estimates.  Findings:   Between Sept 1, 2019, and Dec 15, 2020, we enrolled 343 000 people and ascertained 8374 deaths of individuals younger than 70 years. Malaria was the leading cause of death in children and adults, nationally and in each region, representing 22% of deaths under age 70 years in 2020. Other infectious diseases accounted for an additional 16% of deaths. Overall maternal mortality ratio was 510 deaths per 100 000 livebirths (95% CI 483-538), and neonatal mortality rate was 31·1 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 30·4-31·8), both among the highest rates in the world. Haemorrhage was the major cause of maternal mortality and birth asphyxia or trauma was the major cause of neonatal mortality. Excess deaths were not detected in the months of 2020 corresponding to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Half of the deaths occurred in rural areas and at home. If the Northern, Eastern, and Southern regions of Sierra Leone had the lower death rates observed in the Western region, about 20 000 deaths (just over a quarter of national total deaths in people younger than 70 years) would have been avoided. WHO model-based data vastly underestimated malaria deaths and some specific causes of injury deaths, and substantially overestimated maternal mortality.  Interpretation:   Over 60% of individuals in Sierra Leone die prematurely, before age 70 years, most from preventable or treatable causes. Nationally representative mortality surveys such as the SL-SRS are of high value in providing reliable cause-of-death information to set public health priorities and target interventions in low-income countries.

We aimed to investigate the burden of falls among older people at the national and subnational level in mainland China, and explore the trends from 1990 to 2019, using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.  Method:   Using data from GBD 2019, we estimated the burden of falls among people aged 60 years and older by sex and age group in terms of incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates and assessed these indicators at the subnational level in 31 geographical units (hereafter called provinces). We investigated the overall trend in the burden of falls across these 31 provinces from 1990 to 2019, and assessed the change in the burden of falls by sex, age group (60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, and ≥80 years), and province between 1990 and 2019.  Findings:   In 2019, in mainland China, the incidence rate of falls among people aged 60 years and older was 3799·4 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3062·4-4645·0) new falls per 100 000 population, and 39·2 deaths (21·8-48·8) per 100 000 population and 1238·9 DALYs (920·5-1553·2) per 100 000 population were due to falls. We found no significant difference in the burden of falls between males and females. The incidence, mortality, and DALY rates of falls for people aged 80 years and older were significantly higher than those in the other age groups, except for incidence rate, which was non-significantly different between the age 75-79 years group and the oldest age group. Large variations in the incidence and DALY rates of falls were observed across 31 provinces. Although between 1990 and 2019 we found no significant changes in overall mortality due to falls in all provinces and in DALY rates for 23 provinces (DALY rates significantly decreased in two provinces and increased in six provinces), we found large increases in the incidence rate of falls in both males (percentage change between 1990 and 2019: 82·9% [67·4-100]) and females (77·0% [63·3-91·8]). The percentage change in incidence rate of falls between 1990 and 2019 varied from 50·0% (42·2-59·5) for people aged 60-64 years to 123·8% (105·4-141·9) for people aged 80 years and older. All provinces had significant increases in the incidence rate of falls between 1990 and 2019, with Sichuan having the greatest increase (148·5% [125·5-171·4]) and Jilin the smallest increase (14·7% [3·6-26·1]).  Interpretation:   Between 1990 and 2019, the incidence rate of falls increased substantially in older adults across mainland China, whereas the rates of mortality and DALY of falls among older people remained relatively stable, suggesting improvements in outcomes of falls. Nevertheless, falls remain an ongoing health burden for older people in mainland China, and there is an urgent need to introduce system-wide, integrated, and cost-effective measures to protect and support older people to minimise their risks and combat an increasing absolute burden as the population continues ageing.

However, it has been seldom used for in-service training and continuing medical education. We aimed to develop a PBL curriculum for a short in-service training on breastfeeding for maternal and child health professionals, and to assess the effect of these courses on their knowledge and skills. Also, the project aimed at increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates and duration in an Italian region.  Methods:   After initial training on PBL and an assessment of the learning needs of about 400 health professionals, a small working group developed learning objectives, designed a curriculum, produced manuals, and shaped assessment tools for a new PBL course on breastfeeding. The field test of the new course allowed selection of the tutors for the scaling up of the training to the whole region. During this extension phase, participants were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire. In addition, the health professionals who attended the PBL courses in 2019 were asked to complete an online survey to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) just before, soon after the course, and 4-6 months later.  Results:   The new 29 - hour PBL course, to be delivered in four days over four consecutive weeks, gives priority to tutorial groups and practical activities (71% of the total time). Supervised clinical practices absorb 16% of time. Ethics, communication and woman-centred clinical management content run throughout the four days and all activities. The three manuals, for tutors, participants and practical activities, facilitate the tasks and performance of tutors and participants. After the field test, 32 regional tutors ran courses for 562 health professionals. The analysis of the evaluation showed a high level of satisfaction for perceived effectiveness, relevance to practice, and educational quality. The KAP questionnaires indicated a general improvement after the course and retention after 4-6 months.  Conclusions:   Despite some predictable shortcomings, this new PBL approach for short in-service training courses on breastfeeding showed encouraging results as far as participants' satisfaction and KAP are concerned. The possible effects on rates and duration of exclusive breastfeeding need further research.""","""['Emanuelle Pessa Valente', 'Adriano Cattaneo', 'Maria Vittoria Sola', 'Laura Travan', 'Sofia Quintero Romero', 'Mariarosa Milinco', 'Cinzia Decorti', 'Roberta Giornelli', 'Cinzia Braida', 'Patrizia Dalmin', 'Manuela Giangreco', 'Luca Ronfani;FVG Working Group for Instructional Design on Breastfeeding Training']""","""[' WHO Collaborating Center for Maternal and Child Health, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', ' Epidemiologist, Trieste, Italy.', ' Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy.', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', ' Lactation Consultant, Trieste, Italy.', ' Clinical Epidemiology and Public Health Research Unit, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', ' Centre for Training Activities, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', ' Health Promotion and Prevention, Regional Health Directorate, Trieste, Italy.', ' Clinical Epidemiology and Public Health Research Unit, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy. luca.ronfani@burlo.trieste.it.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Int Breastfeed J""","""['What can we learn from problem-based learning tutors at a graduate entry medical school?

To determine whether disturbed myocardial energetics with the potential to serve as biomarkers are also reflected in the serum metabolome, we analyzed the serum metabolome of asymptomatic carriers in comparison to healthy controls and obstructive HCM patients (HOCM). We performed non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics on serum from fasted asymptomatic gene variant carriers, symptomatic HOCM patients and healthy controls (n = 31, 14 and 9, respectively). Biomarker panels that discriminated the groups were identified by performing multivariate modeling with gradient-boosting classifiers. For all three group-wise comparisons we identified a panel of 30 serum metabolites that best discriminated the groups. These metabolite panels performed equally well as advanced cardiac imaging modalities in distinguishing the groups. Seven metabolites were found to be predictive in two different comparisons and may play an important role in defining the disease stage.

After the first detection of H5N8 viruses in deceased swans in Inner Mongolia, we performed early warning and active monitoring along swan migration routes in central China. We isolated and sequenced 42 avian influenza viruses, including 40 H5N8 viruses, 1 H5N2 virus, and 1 H9N2 virus, in central China. Our H5N8 viruses isolated in swan stopover sites and wintering grounds showed high nucleotide homologies in the whole genome, revealing a common evolutionary source. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b prevalent in 2020 have further diverged into two sub-clades: b1 and b2. The phylogeographic analysis also showed that the viruses of sub-clade b2 most likely originated from poultry in Russia. Notably, whooper swans were found to be responsible for the introduction of sub-clade b2 viruses in central China; whooper and tundra swans play a role in viral spread in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, respectively.

Methods:   Using the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study survey and the 2014 Life History survey, in total, 17 115 respondents aged ≥45 years were included. Logistic regressions were applied to estimate the relationship between aspects of ACEs and diagnosis of both CVDs and diabetes while adjusting for adulthood demographics, health and health behaviors.  Results:   Childhood hunger (OR = 1.75, P < 0.01), childhood socioeconomic status (OR = 1.45, P < 0.05) and abuse from father (OR = 1.50, P < 0.05) were significantly associated with greater odds of comorbid CVDs and diabetes above and beyond adulthood characteristics. In addition, the effects of these ACEs on comorbidity were stronger than their effects on the single chronic condition.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that, for middle-aged and old Chinese adults, ACEs could have long-lasting impacts on multiple chronic conditions in later life.

However, most studies have focused on maternal nativity status only and have not accounted for important characteristics of both parents.  Objective:   To explore whether maternal and paternal nativity and length of residence (LOR) are independently associated with birthweight for gestational age in a representative sample of infants in Canada.  Methods:   We compared mean differences in sex- and gestational age-standardised birthweight z-score by nativity status of both parents in a nationally representative sample of 130,532 singleton infants born between May 2004 and May 2006 to mothers residing in Canada. We categorised parental nativity status into four groups (both parents Canada-born, mother only foreign-born, father only foreign-born and both parents foreign-born) and parents' LOR into three (both ≤10 years, only one parent ≤10 years and both >10 years). We estimated mean differences in birthweight z-score and their 95% confidence intervals in linear regression models adjusted for parity, parents' ages, education, ethnicity and marital status of the mother.  Results:   Compared with babies of Canada-born couples, those of two foreign-born parents had on average smaller birthweight z-score, -0.23 (95% CI -0.28, -0.25). However, after adjustment, the mean difference in z-score was -0.02 (95% CI -0.05, 0.00). Infants born to parents who had both resided in Canada for ≤10 years had a unadjusted mean difference in z-score of -0.27 (95% CI -0.29, -0.26), compared infants whose parents were both Canada-born, but the difference became negligible (-0.02, 95% CI -0.04, 0.01) after adjustment.

The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in acute otitis media (AOM) bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility from the pre-vaccination period (2002-2008) to after the introduction of PCV13 (2010-2019) in northern Israel.  Methods:   Data were collected from 3277 middle ear fluid (MEF) cultures and 4822 common AOM-generating pathogens of children aged <5 years with otitis media, taken during 2002-2019. Age of the child, bacteriology, and antibiotic resistance were compared between 2002 and 2008, the pre-vaccination period when no vaccination was available and 2010-2019 when PCV13 was introduced.  Results:   The mean age of the children in the pre-vaccination and the vaccination periods was 18.7 ± 13.7 and 15.7 ± 12.5 months, respectively (p < 0.001); the mean age of those with group A streptococcus (GAS) positive cultures was older, p < 0.001.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) decreased between those periods, from 47% to 25.8%, p < 0.001, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenza) increased from 38.4% to 47.1%, p < 0.001, GAS increased from 12.9% to 23.8%, p < 0.001, and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. cat) increased but not statistically significant from 1.7% to 3.1%. The yearly number of positive MEF cultures decreased from 395.1 to 205.6, p < 0.001. The antibiotic sensitivity rate of almost all antibiotics increased between the two study periods.  Conclusion:   The most common MEF bacteria in northern Israel today is H. influenzae. Comparing the pre-vaccination to the vaccination period, the incidence of S. pneumonia-positive cultures decreased while GAS and H. influenza cultures increased.

In this study, the genetic variability of the frequently circulating RV types in Northern Tunisia was investigated, using phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses with a specific focus on the most frequent RV types: RV-A101 and RV-C45. This study concerned 13 RV types frequently circulating in Northern Tunisia. They were obtained from respiratory samples collected in 271 pediatric SARI cases, between September 2015 and November 2017. A total of 37 RV VP4-VP2 sequences, selected among a total of 49 generated sequences, was compared to 359 sequences from different regions of the world. Evolutionary analysis of RV-A101 and RV-C45 showed high genetic relationship between different Tunisian strains and Malaysian strains. RV-A101 and C45 progenitor viruses' dates were estimated in 1981 and 1995, respectively. Since the early 2000s, the two types had a wide spread throughout the world. Phylogenetic analyses of other frequently circulating strains showed significant homology of Tunisian strains from the same epidemic period, in contrast with earlier strains. The genetic relatedness of RV-A101 and RV-C45 might result from an introduction of viruses from different clades followed by local dissemination rather than a local persistence of an endemic clades along seasons.

Currently, musculoskeletal manifestations related to joint hypermobility are perceived as the most prevalent determinants of the quality of life of affected individuals. The 2017 International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and related disorders identifies 13 clinical types due to deleterious variants in 19 different genes. Recent publications point out the possibility of a wider spectrum of conditions that may be considered members of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome community. Most Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are due to inherited abnormalities affecting the biogenesis of fibrillar collagens and other components of the extracellular matrix. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies in the diagnostic setting fastened patients' classification and improved our knowledge on the phenotypic variability of many Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This is impacting significantly patients' management and family counseling. At the same time, most individuals presenting with joint hypermobility and associated musculoskeletal manifestations still remain without a firm diagnosis, due to a too vague clinical presentation and/or the lack of an identifiable molecular biomarker. These individuals are currently defined with the term ""hypermobility spectrum disorders"".

Three working scenarios, i.e., tissue-specific, pleiotropic, and coassociated, were observed for candidate genetic predisposition affecting IgG N-glycosylation traits. Furthermore, pathway enrichment showed several IgG N-glycosylation-related pathways, such as asparagine N-linked glycosylation, N-glycan biosynthesis and transport to the Golgi and subsequent modification. Through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), most genetic variants underlying TWAS hits were found to be correlated with health measures (height, waist-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure) and diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease, which are related to IgG N-glycosylation.

Previous studies have reported the complexities associated with understanding the determinants of stunting. This study aimed to examine the household-, subdistrict- and province-level determinants of stunting in Indonesia using a multilevel hierarchical mixed effects model.  Methods:   We analyzed data for 8045 children taken from the 2007 and 2014 waves of the Indonesian Family and Life Surveys (IFLS). We included individual-, family-/household- and community-level variables in the analyses. A multilevel mixed effects model was employed to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Moreover, the model captured the effect of unobserved household-, subdistrict- and province-level characteristics on the probability of children being stunted.  Results:   Our findings showed that the odds of childhood stunting vary significantly not only by individual child- and household-level characteristics but also by province- and subdistrict-level characteristics. Among the child-level covariates included in our model, dietary habits, neonatal weight, a history of infection, and sex significantly affected the risk of stunting. Household wealth status and parental education are significant household-level covariates associated with a higher risk of stunting. Finally, the risk of stunting is higher for children living in communities without access to water, sanitation and hygiene.  Conclusions:   Stunting is associated with not only child-level characteristics but also family- and community-level characteristics. Hence, interventions to reduce stunting should also take into account family and community characteristics to achieve effective outcomes.""","""['Tri Mulyaningsih', 'Itismita Mohanty', 'Vitri Widyaningsih', 'Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin', 'Riyana Miranti', 'Vincent Hadi Wiyono']""","""[' Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia.', ' Health Research Institute, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia.', ' Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia.', ' Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society, Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Determinants of stunting in Indonesian children: evidence from a cross-sectional survey indicate a prominent role for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector in stunting reduction.', 'Determinants of socioeconomic and rural-urban disparities in stunting: evidence from Indonesia.', 'Determinants of the Stunting of Children Under Two Years Old in Indonesia: A Multilevel Analysis of the 2013 Indonesia Basic Health Survey.', 'Determinants of stunting and overweight among young children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Family Household Characteristics and Stunting: An Update Scoping Review.', 'Factors driving and inhibiting stunting reduction acceleration programs at district level: A qualitative study in West Sumatra.', 'Sociodemographic and Healthcare Factors Associated with Stunting in Children Aged 6-59 Months in the Urban Area of Bali Province, Indonesia 2018.', 'Spatial and Machine Learning Approach to Model Childhood Stunting in Pakistan: Role of Socio-Economic and Environmental Factors.', 'Stunting among kindergarten children in China in the context of COVID-19: A cross-sectional study.']"""

However, some intrinsic problems remain. For example, genomic sequences with varying read depths, read lengths, and assemblers influence the genome assemblies, introducing error or missing alleles into the generated allelic profiles. These errors and missing alleles might create ""specious discrepancy"" among closely related isolates, thus making accurate epidemiological interpretation challenging. In addition, the rapid growth of the cgMLST allelic profile database can cause problems related to storage and maintenance as well as long query search times.  Methods:   We attempted to resolve these issues by decreasing the scheme size to reduce the occurrence of error and missing alleles, alleviate the storage burden, and improve the query search time. The challenge in this approach is maintaining the typing resolution when using fewer loci. We achieved this by using a popular artificial intelligence technique, XGBoost, coupled with Shapley additive explanations for feature selection. Finally, 370 loci from the original 1701 cgMLST loci of Listeria monocytogenes were selected.  Results:   Although the size of the final scheme (LmScheme_370) was approximately 80% lower than that of the original cgMLST scheme, its discriminatory power, tested for 35 outbreaks, was concordant with that of the original cgMLST scheme. Although we used L. monocytogenes as a demonstration in this study, the approach can be applied to other schemes and pathogens. Our findings might help elucidate gene-by-gene-based epidemiology.""","""['Yen-Yi Liu', 'Chih-Chieh Chen']""","""[' Department of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ' Institute of Medical Science and Technology, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', ' Rapid Screening Research Center for Toxicology and Biomedicine, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Defining and Evaluating a Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing Scheme for Whole-Genome Sequence-Based Typing of Listeria monocytogenes.', 'Retrospective investigation of listeriosis outbreaks in small ruminants using different analytical approaches for whole genome sequencing-based typing of Listeria monocytogenes.', 'Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing for Identification of Globally Distributed Clonal Groups and Differentiation of Outbreak Strains of Listeria monocytogenes.', 'A Vibrio cholerae Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing Scheme To Facilitate the Epidemiological Study of Cholera.', 'Recent developments in molecular sub-typing of Listeria monocytogenes.']"""

An outbreak signal was issued on May 15th 2020 with 15 suspected cases after a military training course in the rainforest. An outbreak investigation was carried out.  Methodology/principal findings:   Thirty cases were confirmed. Leishmania guyanensis was the most frequent species (90%). The most frequent presentation was ulcerative (90%). Lesions on the face and hands were frequent (40% each). Eight cases (26%) presented a poor outcome after treatment with pentamidine and required a second line with amphotericin B. Three of them required further treatments with meglumine antimoniate or miltefosine. Two spots within the training area were deemed as likely sites of contamination, due to illegal logging. The isolated Leishmania strains did not form a separate cluster. Participation in Week 13 of year 2020 was associated with infection (OR = 4.59 [1.10-19.83]; p = 0.016) while undergoing only the ""Fighting"" exercise was protective (OR = 0.1 [0-0.74]; p = 0.021).

However, no data are currently available regarding the association of BUN levels and neonatal sepsis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of BUN in predicting the presence and severity of neonatal sepsis.  Methods:   In this study, we enrolled 925 neonates. Among them, 737 neonates were diagnosed with sepsis, including 426 neonates with severe sepsis. Neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (n = 188) served as controls. We collected complete clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the potential independent risk factor for neonatal sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of BUN in predicting neonatal sepsis. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS 24.0.  Results:   Neonates with sepsis and severe sepsis had a higher level of BUN. The prevalence of neonates with severe sepsis was dramatically increased according to BUN tertiles. Correlation analysis showed that BUN levels were positively correlated with the levels of infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that BUN was an independent risk factor for the presence and severity of neonatal sepsis. ROC curve analysis showed that BUN had a well discriminatory power in predicting sepsis (area under curve (AUC) = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.66-0.74, p < .001) and severe sepsis (AUC = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.67-0.78, p < .001).

The Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), a dedicated diarrheal disease hospital, had a large upsurge in patient visits during the epidemic. An enhanced understanding of the epidemiology of this epidemic may help health-related professionals better prepare for such events in the future. This study examined the microbial etiology and non-pathogen factors associated with diarrhea during the epidemic. The study also evaluated the patients' presentation and clinical course and estimated the potential mortality averted by treating patients during the epidemic.  Methodology/principal findings:   Data from the patients who were treated at Dhaka Hospital during the diarrhea epidemic between April 2 and May 12, 2018 and were enrolled into the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System (DDSS) at icddr,b were compared with the DDSS-enrolled patients treated during the seasonally-matched periods in the flanking years using logistic regression. icddr,b Dhaka Hospital treated 29,212 diarrheal patients during the 2018 epidemic period (and 25,950 patients per comparison period on average). Vibrio cholerae was the most common pathogen isolated (7,946 patients; 27%) and associated with diarrhea during the epidemic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0). The interaction of Vibrio cholerae with ETEC (AOR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.9) or Campylobacter (AOR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.1) was associated with further increased odds of diarrhea during the epidemic. In children under five years old, rotavirus was the most common pathogen (2,029 patients; 26%). Those who were adolescents (AOR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and young adults (AOR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.5) compared to children younger than five years, resided within a 10 km radius of Dhaka Hospital (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) compared to those living outside 20 km, borrowed money or relied on aid to pay for the transport to the hospital (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0), used tap water (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4-2.4) for drinking compared to tubewell water, and disposed of the solid waste directly outside the house (AOR 4.0, 95% CI: 2.7-5.9) were more likely to present with diarrhea during the epidemic. During the epidemic, patients were more likely to present with severe dehydration (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) and require inpatient admission (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.9-3.3), intravenous rehydration (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.1), and antibiotics (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.7). The in-hospital case fatality rate was low (13 patients; 0.04%), and the hospital averted between 12,523 and 17,265 deaths during the epidemic.  Conclusions/significance:   Vibrio cholerae played the primary role in the 2018 diarrhea epidemic in Dhaka. Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and rotavirus had a secondary role. Adolescents and adults, residents of the metropolitan area, and those who were relatively poor and lacked safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices comprised the most vulnerable groups.

As such, determining the source(s) of these bacteria when isolated from patients with diarrhoea is an important step in disease prevention.  Objectives:   To identify the presence of genes coding for virulence and phylogroups among E. coli isolated from children hospitalized due to diarrhoea in Limpopo Province, South Africa.  Methods:   E. coli isolates were identified using the VITEK-2 automated system. An 11-gene multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to differentiate five pathogenic types of E. coli: enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic (ETEC). The Clermont quadruplex PCR method was used to identify phylogroups of isolates.  Results:   From the 133 isolates tested, 79 were confirmed as E. coli. Of these, 19.0% (15/79) were commensals and 81.0% (64/79) were positive for at least one pathotype, of which ETEC was predominant (16.5%, 13/79), followed by EAEC (10.1%, 8/79), EPEC (7.6%, 6/79) and EHEC (2.5%, 2/79). Hybrid pathotypes were also detected and EAEC/ETEC was predominant (25.3%, 20/79). Phylogroup B2 was predominant (30.4%, 24/79), followed by phylogroup B1 (22.8%, 18/79), and phylogroups C and E (both 12.7%, 10/79). Just over 6% (5/79) of isolates were non-typable.  Conclusion:   There was a high distribution of diarrhoeagenic E. coli associated with different phylogroups among children living in Limpopo Province, South Africa.

Results:   Of the patients, 430 (77.3%) were female and 126 (22.7%) were male. The median age was 57 years, the median HAQ score was 0.55 points, and the median DAS28-CRP score was 4.1 points. The evaluation of the patients by DAS28-CRP revealed that 58.5% of the patients had moderate and severe disease activity, while only 23.4% of them were in remission. The group using the combination of synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARD) and steroid therapy had significantly higher HAD-depression, HAD-anxiety, mHCL, DAS28-CRP, HAQ, and MDQ scores than the group using sDMARD alone. The grouping of the patients based on the DAS28-CRP cut-off scores showed that the patients with moderate and severe disease activity had significantly higher HADS, mHCL, MDQ scores than those in remission and those with mild disease activity (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Disease severity and functional status in RA can be affected by comorbid anxiety-depressive and mixed symptoms. Therefore, clinicians should consider screening the depressive-anxiety and mixed mood symptoms of RA patients. Moreover, patients who use steroid therapy are more susceptible to mood symptoms (anxiety, depression, bipolarity), which should also be considered during the follow-up of patients.""","""['Melih Pamukcu', 'Tuğba İzci Duran', 'Hasan Ulusoy', 'Kürşat Altınbaş']""","""[' Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Education and Research Hospital, Health Sciences University, Ankara, Turkey', ' Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayıs University, Samsun, Turkey', ' Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Selçuk University, Konya, Turkey']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Turk J Med Sci""","""['Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Score Is an Independent Factor Associated With the EuroQoL 5-Dimensional Descriptive System in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Successful psychopharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive disorders improve functional limitations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Risk factors, including different biologics, associated with depression and anxiety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross-sectional observational study.', 'The impact of tocilizumab on anxiety and depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.']"""

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can improve infection control, but this practice is not routinely used by hospital clinical laboratories in Portugal. We simulated the investigation of a CRKP outbreak based on WGS, with the aim of determining, in the minimum possible time, genetic relatedness between CRKP clinical and environmental isolates.  Material and methods:   Ten CRKP clinical isolates routinely obtained in the hospital laboratory were used. Forty environmental samples - from sinks and sink drains of ward rooms - were collected. Environmental samples were plated on selective media and presumptive CRKP colonies were isolated. Total DNA was extracted from all putative CRKP isolates and sequenced. Clonal relatedness was determined by multi-locus sequence typing and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism analysis; the presence of carbapenemase genes was evaluated.  Results:   Clinical isolates were characterized in 48 hours: eight strains were confirmed as CRKP, of which six were of ST13 and carried blaKPC-3. Environmental samples results were obtained in six days: eight CRKP were isolated from which five were of ST13 and carried blaKPC-3. Clinical and environmental ST13 isolates were highly related: ten (of 11) isolates differed from each other in < 0.001% of 2 172 367 core nucleotides.  Discussion:   WGS can be used as a high-resolution effective tool to investigate healthcare associated infections and track routes of dissemination in real-time.  Conclusion:   In Portugal, routine use of WGS to improve infection control could thrive through collaborative initiatives between hospitals and research institutes.""","""['Alexandra Sofia Simões', 'Tiago Touret', 'Nuno Alexandre Faria', 'Susana Peres Ladeiro', 'João Costa', 'Soraia Bispo', 'Mónica Serrano', 'Carlos Palos', 'Maria Miragaia', 'Ricardo Bastos Leite', 'Raquel Sá-Leão']""","""[' Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology of Human Pathogens.

Methods:   Newborns who underwent WFDRI at 61 obstetrics/gynecology hospitals between January 2017 and December 2019 were enrolled. Demographics and related factors were compared among newborns with and without RHs. The newborns' eyes were divided into the minimal, mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the number of RHs, and characteristics like bilaterality, laterality, involved retinal layer, involved zone, macular and/or optic nerve (ON) involvement were compared.  Results:   Among 56247 newborns, 13026 had birth-related RHs (23.2%). Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSVD) showed the highest association with RHs (odds ratio, 19.774; 95% confidence interval, 18.277-21.393; P < 0.001) on multivariate analysis. Bilateral RHs (8414/13026; 64.59%) were more common than unilateral RHs (4612/13026; 35.41%); however, unilateral RHs (2383/4217; 56.51%) were more common than bilateral RHs (1834/4217; 43.49%) in the minimal group. RHs showed no laterality differences between the two eyes (P = 0.493). Most RHs were intraretinal (18678/21440; 87.12%), and 2328 (31.65%) eyes with preretinal hemorrhage were observed in the severe group. Zone I RHs were common in the minimal (7072/7090; 99.75%), mild (4953/4960; 99.86%), and moderate (2013/2035; 98.92%) groups; zone I and II RHs were common in the severe group (4843/7355; 65.85%); and RHs in zone III were rare (7/21440; 0.03%). Most RHs showed no macular and/or ON involvement in the minimal and mild group; however, this was common in the severe group (7111/7355; 96.68%).  Conclusions:   Birth-related RHs were common in healthy newborns and were significantly associated with NSVD.

Epidemics are unpredictable and unprecedented. When epidemics occur, health services are over whelmed leading to overcrowding of hospitals. At present there is no evidence that dengue epidemics can be predicted. Since the breeding of the dengue mosquito is directly influenced by environmental factors, it is plausible that epidemics could be predicted using weather data. We hypothesized that there is a mathematical relationship between incidence of dengue fever and environmental factors and if such relationship exists, new cases of dengue fever in the succeeding months can be predicted using weather data of the current month. We developed a mathematical model using machine learning technique. We used Island wide dengue epidemiology data, weather data and population density in developing the model. We used incidence of dengue fever, average rain fall, humidity, wind speed, temperature and population density of each district in the model. We found that the model is able to predict the incidence of dengue fever of a given month in a given district with precision (RMSE between 18- 35.3). Further, using weather data of a given month, the number of cases of dengue in succeeding months too can be predicted with precision (RMSE 10.4-30). Health authorities can use existing weather data in predicting epidemics in the immediate future and therefore measures to prevent new cases can be taken and more importantly the authorities can prepare local authorities for outbreaks.""","""['Chathurangi Edussuriya', 'Sampath Deegalla', 'Indika Gawarammana']""","""[' Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', ' Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS Negl Trop Dis""","""['The complex relationship between weather and dengue virus transmission in Thailand.', 'The association between dengue incidences and provincial-level weather variables in Thailand from 2001 to 2014.', 'Nonlinear and delayed impacts of climate on dengue risk in Barbados: A modelling study.', 'Modeling and projection of dengue fever cases in Guangzhou based on variation of weather factors.', 'Dengue fever in the Indian Subcontinent: an overview.', 'A systematic review of dengue outbreak prediction models: Current scenario and future directions.', 'A Novel CNN-TLSTM Approach for Dengue Disease Identification and Prevention using IoT-Fog Cloud Architecture.']"""

To achieve the target of WHO (World Health Organization) 2019, it becomes necessary to understand various attributes associated with snakebite including community awareness, improvisation of medical facilities and to map the potential distribution of venomous snakes responsible for the bite. Hence this study is conducted in Sikkim, India to understand the epidemiology of snakebite in Sikkim. The potential distribution and risk mapping of five common venomous snakes are done for effective management of snakebite cases.  Methods and findings:   The snakebite cases registered in six district hospitals and four PHCs (Primary Health Centers) of Sikkim were collected from the year 2011 to 2018. Community survey was also conducted to supplement the data. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) was performed to predict the potential habitat of five common venomous snakes of Sikkim. The risk modeling of snakebite cases was done at the level of Gram Panchayat Unit (GPU) using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) model. We found higher number of male victims inflicted with snakebite envenomation. The potential distribution of the five venomous snakes showed satisfactory mean AUC (Area under Curve) value. Both the models showed significant positive association of snakebite cases with habitat suitability of the venomous snakes. Hospital data revealed no death cases whereas community data reported 24 deaths.  Conclusions:   Death from snakebite reflected in community data but not in hospital data strongly indicates the people's belief in traditional medicine. Though people of Sikkim have rich traditional knowledge, in case of snakebite traditional practices may be ineffective leading to loss of life. Sensitizing people and improving medical facilities along with proper transport facilities in rural areas might significantly reduce the snakebite casualties in the state.""","""['Ananta Rai', 'Manita Chettri', 'Sailendra Dewan', 'Bidita Khandelwal', 'Basundhara Chettri']""","""[' Department of Zoology, School of Life Sciences, Sikkim University, Tadong, Gangtok, East Sikkim, India.', ' Department of General Medicine, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences, Sikkim Manipal University, Gangtok, East Sikkim, India.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS Negl Trop Dis""","""[""Applying species distribution models in public health research by predicting snakebite risk using venomous snakes' habitat suitability as an indicating factor."", 'Perceptions, awareness on snakebite envenoming among the tribal community and health care providers of Dahanu block, Palghar District in Maharashtra, India.', 'Ten years of snakebites in Iran.', 'Identifying the snake: First scoping review on practices of communities and healthcare providers confronted with snakebite across the world.', 'Snakebite in domestic animals: First global scoping review.']"""

The results of this study aim to bridge a gap in national research. In the present paper, we used daily natural mortality data and daily minimum and maximum air temperatures. The distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) allowed us to identify weather conditions associated with natural mortality. The most important results are as follows: (i) a higher daily mortality is related to a high frequency of heat stress conditions; (ii) a higher maximum temperature increases the relative risk (RR) of natural mortality; (iii) the maximum number of fatalities is recorded on the first day of high-temperature events; and (iv) individuals much more easily adapt to cold stress conditions.

Extracted DNA was PCR amplified using barcoded 16S rRNA gene V4 primers. Sequenced libraries were processed using QIIME2. Phyloseq was used to calculate α- and β- diversity measures. Biomarkers associated with case status were identified using ANCOM after adjustment for patient age, race and BMI. PICRUSt was used to identify microbial pathways associated with case status.  Results:   Beta-diversity of microbial communities across each niche was significantly different (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001). Alpha-diversity of the uterine microbiome was reduced in USC (Chao1, p = 0.004 and Fisher, p = 0.007) compared to EAC. Biomarkers from the three anatomical sites allowed samples to be clustered into two distinct clades that distinguished controls from USC cases (p = 0.042). The USC group was defined by 13 bacterial taxa across the three sites (W-stat>10, FDR<0.05) including depletion of cervicovaginal Lactobacillus and elevation of uterine Pseudomonas. PICRUSTt analysis revealed highly significant differences between the USC-associated clades within the cervicovaginal and uterine microbiota.  Conclusions:   The microbial diversity of anatomic niches in postmenopausal women with EAC and USC is different compared to controls.

Methods Clinical and epidemiological data of urgent/emergent surgical admissions and interventions in the Autonomous Province of Trento's hospital network were collected from the internal common electronic database. The investigation periods were March-May 2019 (reference period), March-May 2020 (phase-I), June - August 2020 (phase-II), and October - December 2020 (phase-III). The same data were divided and grouped for the six most represented diagnoses. Results: The number of admissions for surgical emergencies in the studied periods showed a sinusoidal trend. In the reference period of 2019, 957 patients were admitted in urgency, while in the three pandemic phases, urgent admissions were 511, 888 and 633 respectively (-47% in phase I, - 8% in phase II, -34% in phase III). This trend was also observed by stratifying admissions for single disease, except for gastrointestinal perforations and pancreatitis, which showed a slight increasing trend in phase-I. Among the studied population, the surgical rate was 35.2% in phase-I and 34.3% in phase-III; these data were significantly higher than in 2019 (25.6%). Conclusions The effect of the COVID pandemic on surgical emergencies and urgencies (SUEs) was mainly indirect, manifesting itself with a significant reduction in the number of surgical admissions, particularly in phases-I and-III. Conversely, in the same phases, the surgical rate showed a significant increase compared to 2019.""","""['Alessandro Carrara', 'Dalia Amabile', 'Riccardo Pertile', 'Federico Reich', 'Francesca Laura Nava', 'Paolo Moscatelli', 'Luigi Pellecchia', 'Michele Motter', 'Orazio Zappalà', 'Gianmarco Ghezzi', 'Pierpaolo Benetollo', 'Giuseppe Tirone']""","""[' 1st U.O. of General Surgery, Department of General Surgery, S.

In the pre-Covid-19 era world, OHCA survival rate in Europe was 7-6%. The main objective is to analyze OHCA survival in the Lombardy region by highlighting the factors related to both the victims' characteristics and the chain of survival.  Methods:   All OHCAs were grouped into four pre-established periods in 2019 (14-23 January; 15-24 April; 15-24 July; 14-23 October). Following the Utstein method, we selected witnessed OHCAs with presumed cardiac etiology. The outcome of each case was collected in four moments in time: Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), Emergency Department (ED), 24 hours and 30 days. The neurological outcome 30 days after OHCA was also investigated and stratified with the Cerebral Performance Category Score (CPC).  Results:   We selected 456 cases of OHCA with witnessed cardiac etiology. ROSC was achieved in 121 cases (26.5%), survival in the Emergency Departments in 110 patients (24.1%), after 24 hours in 86 (18.86%) and after 30 days in 72 (15.8%). Male sex was shown to improve OHCA survival. A shockable presentation rhythm, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) performed by bystanders and the activation of Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) positively influenced OHCA outcome.  Conclusions:   Males are more predisposed to incur an OHCA event than females, but they have greater chances of survival. Factors most related to survival are: shockable rhythm, bystanders CPR and the activation of a PAD.

In children, however, it has not been established because of its strong age dependency. To overcome this obstacle, we recently introduced the zlog value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (zlog-proBNP) as an age-adjusted reference.  Objectives:   This study evaluates the prognostic power of zlog-proBNP for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) throughout childhood in patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD).  Methods:   A total of 910 children with CHD (median age 5 months; range 0.0-18.0 years) were included. MACE was defined as death, resuscitation, mechanical circulatory support, or hospitalization caused by cardiac decompensation. Because the physiological NT-proBNP concentration decreases significantly during childhood, zlog values were applied for an age-independent evaluation.  Results:   MACE occurred in 138 children during a median follow-up of 6 months (range 1 day to 7.6 years). High zlog-proBNP values (>+3.0) were most strongly associated with adverse events (n = 93; adjusted HR: 21.1; 95% CI: 2.9-154.2; P < 0.001). Among all evaluated indicators, zlog-proBNP was the best predictor for MACE (adjusted HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.31-1.76; P < 0.001) along with age and predictively superior to absolute NT-proBNP values. A cutoff value of +1.96 (age-independent upper limit of the physiological NT-proBNP concentration) achieved a negative predictive value of >96%.  Conclusions:   Zlog-proBNP overcomes the strong age dependency of NT-proBNP and is a powerful prognostic marker for age-independent exclusion and prediction of MACE in children with CHD. We therefore expect zlog-proBNP to play a pivotal role in the future management of children with heart diseases.""","""['Jonas Palm', 'Stefan Holdenrieder', 'Georg Hoffmann', 'Jürgen Hörer', 'Ruibing Shi', 'Frank Klawonn', 'Peter Ewert']""","""[' Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Defects, German Heart Center of the Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.

Objectives:   This study sought to evaluate the safety and effectiveness through 2-year follow-up of TMVR in high-surgical-risk patients with severe MR.  Methods:   The first 100 patients enrolled in the Expanded Clinical Study of the Tendyne Mitral Valve System, an open-label, nonrandomized, prospective study of transapical TMVR, were followed for 2 years.  Results:   The patients (aged 74.7 ± 8.0 years, 69.0% male) had symptomatic (66.0% New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III or IV) grade 3+ or 4+ MR that was secondary or mixed in 89 (89.0%). Prostheses were successfully implanted in 97 (97.0%) patients. At 2 years, all-cause mortality was 39.0%; 17 (43.6%) of 39 deaths occurred during the first 90 days. Heart failure hospitalization (HFH) fell from 1.30 events per year preprocedure to 0.51 per year in the 2 years post-TMVR (P < 0.0001). At 2 years, 93.2% of surviving patients had no MR. No patient had >1+ MR. The improvement in symptoms at 1 year (88.5% NYHA functional class I or II) was sustained to 2 years (81.6% NYHA functional class I or II). Among survivors, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 45.6 ± 9.4% at baseline and 39.8 ± 9.5% at 2 years (P = 0.0012).

De novo extraction of signatures is commonly performed using Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation methods, however, accurate attribution of these signatures to individual samples is a distinct problem requiring uncertainty estimation, particularly in noisy scenarios or when the acting signatures have similar shapes. Whilst many packages for signature attribution exist, a few provide accuracy measures, and most are not easily reproducible nor scalable in high-performance computing environments.  Results:   We present Mutational Signature Attribution (MSA), a reproducible pipeline designed to assign signatures of different mutation types on a single-sample basis, using Non-Negative Least Squares method with optimisation based on configurable simulations. Parametric bootstrap is proposed as a way to measure statistical uncertainties of signature attribution. Supported mutation types include single and doublet base substitutions, indels and structural variants. Results are validated using simulations with reference COSMIC signatures, as well as randomly generated signatures.  Conclusions:   MSA is a tool for optimised mutational signature attribution based on simulations, providing confidence intervals using parametric bootstrap. It comprises a set of Python scripts unified in a single Nextflow pipeline with containerisation for cross-platform reproducibility and scalability in high-performance computing environments.

Additionally, the population attributable risk for multi-morbidity in reference to those women who smoke tobacco, chew tobacco, and consume alcohol is estimated.  Methods:   The data was derived from the National Family Health Survey which was conducted in 2015-16. The effective sample size for the present paper 699,686 women aged 15-49 years in India. Descriptive statistics along with bivariate analysis were used to do the preliminary analysis. Additionally, binary logistic regression analysis was used to fulfil the objectives.  Results:   About 1.6% of women had multimorbidity in India. The prevalence of multimorbidity was high among women from southern region of India. Women who smoke tobacco, chew tobacco and consume alcohol had 87% [AOR: 1.87CI: 1.65, 2.10], 18% [AOR: 1.18; CI: 1.10, 1.26] and 18% [AOR: 1.18; CI: 1.04, 1.33] significantly higher likelihood to suffer from multi-morbidity than their counterparts respectively.

Placental lesions with DM remain unclear and controversial. Recently, the terms of placental pathological findings, such as maternal and fetal vascular malperfusions (MVM and FVM, respectively) were introduced by the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement (APWGCS). FVM cases were classified as the partial obstruction type (global FVM) and the complete obstruction type (segmental FVM). The aim of this study was to clarify the pathological characteristics of the placenta with pregestational DM/gestational DM; GDM according to APWGCS.  Methods:   We studied the placentas of 182 DM women (27 pregestational DM and 155 GDM) and control placentas of 460 women without DM during 2011-2018. We excluded cases of intrauterine fetal death or multiple pregnancies. We reviewed microscopical findings including, MVM, FVM, chorioamnionitis with the slides according to the APWGCS.  Results:   Microscopically, the incidence of FVM was significantly higher in GDM patients than control (17% vs. 10%, p = 0.0138), but not significant in pregestational DM (11%, p = 0.7410). Segmental FVM (complete obstruction) was significantly more observed in GDM than control group (5% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.0013). Segmental FVM in GDM showed high incidence of light-for-dates infant (three of seven cases, 43%, p = 0.0288). In addition, several segmental FVM findings (villous stromal-vascular karyorrhexis and stem vessel occlusion) were frequently noted in 2 or 3 points positive of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test than 1 point positive GDM.

However, it is unclear whether the observed decreased effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing viral loads is inherent to the Delta variant or is dependent on time from immunization. By analyzing viral loads of over 16,000 infections during the current, Delta-variant-dominated pandemic wave in Israel, we found that BTIs in recently fully vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads than infections in unvaccinated individuals. However, this effect starts to decline 2 months after vaccination and ultimately vanishes 6 months or longer after vaccination. Notably, we found that the effect of BNT162b2 on reducing BTI viral loads is restored after a booster dose. These results suggest that BNT162b2 might decrease the infectiousness of BTIs even with the Delta variant, and that, although this protective effect declines with time, it can be restored, at least temporarily, with a third, booster, vaccine dose.""","""['Matan Levine-Tiefenbrun', 'Idan Yelin', 'Hillel Alapi', 'Rachel Katz', 'Esma Herzel', 'Jacob Kuint', 'Gabriel Chodick', 'Sivan Gazit', 'Tal Patalon', 'Roy Kishony']""","""[' Faculty of Biology, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', ' Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', ' Maccabitech, Maccabi Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ' Maccabitech, Maccabi Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel. patalon_t@mac.org.il.', ' Faculty of Biology, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. rkishony@technion.ac.il.', ' Faculty of Computer Science, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. rkishony@technion.ac.il.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Nat Med""","""['Waning of SARS-CoV-2 booster viral-load reduction effectiveness.', 'Association of a Third Dose of BNT162b2 Vaccine With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.', 'Waning Immunity after the BNT162b2 Vaccine in Israel.', 'Impact of the Delta variant on vaccine efficacy and response strategies.', 'Impact and effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths following a nationwide vaccination campaign in Israel: an observational study using national surveillance data.', 'Low humoral and cellular immune responses early after breakthrough infection may contribute to severe COVID-19.', 'Covid-19: virology, variants, and vaccines.', 'Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against general SARS-CoV-2 infection from the omicron variant: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Contextualizing Wastewater-Based surveillance in the COVID-19 vaccination era.', 'COVID-19 and cellular senescence.']"""

They cause recurring threats to the public health systems of tropical countries such as Brazil. The primary Brazilian vector of both viruses is the mosquito Aedes aegypti. After the mosquito ingests a blood meal from an infected person, the viruses infect and replicate in the midgut, disseminate to secondary tissues and reach the salivary gland (SG), where they are ready to be transmitted to a vertebrate host. It is thought that the intrinsic discrepancies among mosquitoes could affect their ability to deal with viral infections. This study confirms that the DENV and ZIKV infection patterns of nine Ae. aegypti field populations found in geographically separate health districts of an endemic Brazilian city vary. We analyzed the infection rate, disseminated infection, vector competence, and viral load through quantitative PCR. Mosquitoes were challenged using the membrane-feeding assay technique and were tested seven and fourteen days post-infection (early and late infection phases, respectively). The infection responses varied among the Ae. aegypti populations for both flaviviruses in the two infection phases. There was no similarity between DENV and ZIKV vector competencies or viral loads. According to the results of our study, the risk of viral transmission overtime after infection either increases or remains unaltered in ZIKV infected vectors. However, the risk may increase, decrease, or remain unaltered in DENV-infected vectors depending on the mosquito population. For both flaviviruses, the viral load persisted in the body even until the late infection phase. In contrast to DENV, the ZIKV accumulated in the SG over time in all the mosquito populations. These findings are novel and may help direct the development of control strategies to fight dengue and Zika outbreaks in endemic regions, and provide a warning about the importance of understanding mosquito responses to arboviral infections.""","""['Raquel Soares Maia Godoy', 'Luiza Dos Santos Felix', 'Alessandra da Silva Orfanó', 'Bárbara Aparecida Chaves', 'Paula Monalisa Nogueira', 'Breno Dos Anjos Costa', 'Aline Silva Soares', 'Cinthia Catharina Azevedo Oliveira', 'Rafael Nacif-Pimenta', 'Breno Mello Silva', 'Ana Paula Duarte', 'Marcus Vinicius Guimarães de Lacerda', 'Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro', 'Nágila Francinete Costa Secundino', 'Paulo Filemon Paolucci Pimenta']""","""[' Instituto de Pesquisas René Rachou, FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', ' Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biologia Celular, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', ' Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.', ' Programa de Pós-Graduação em Medicina Tropical, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.', ' Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências da Saúde, FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', ' Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', ' Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane, FIOCRUZ, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS Negl Trop Dis""","""['A high-risk Zika and dengue transmission hub: virus detections in mosquitoes at a Brazilian university campus.', 'Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of Aedes aegypti in the Brazilian Amazon.', 'Vector competence of Aedes aegypti and screening for differentially expressed microRNAs exposed to Zika virus.', 'Dengue and Zika viruses: lessons learned from the similarities between these Aedes mosquito-vectored arboviruses.', 'Vector Competence: What Has Zika Virus Taught Us?', ""Vector Competence for Zika Virus Changes Depending on the Aedes aegypti's Region of Origin in Manaus: A Study of an Endemic Brazilian Amazonian City."", 'Aedes aegypti Strain Subjected to Long-Term Exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis svar. israelensis Larvicides Displays an Altered Transcriptional Response to Zika Virus Infection.', 'Evaluation of cutaneous immune response in a controlled human in vivo model of mosquito bites.', 'Dengue Infection Susceptibility of Five Aedes aegypti Populations from Manaus (Brazil) after Challenge with Virus Serotypes 1-4.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed our database to identify the proportion of subjects diagnosed with ABPA at ≥60 years of age (ABPA-elderly). We compared the clinical features, treatment and outcomes of ABPA-elderly versus the non-elderly (ABPA diagnosed at <60 years of age).  Results:   Between 2007 and 2019, we encountered 810 ABPA subjects with a mean age of 34.9 years (49.4% women). Of these, 43 (5.3%) were aged ≥60 years (ABPA-elderly). There was a trend towards lower median (interquartile range [IQR]) serum total IgE (4900 [2659-10000] vs. 7156 [23360-11963] IU/mL; P = .06) and Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE (12.3 [4.8-29.6] vs. 22.4 [7.7-41.5] kUA/L; P = .06) in the elderly than the non-elderly. Eosinophil counts were similar in the two groups. The median [IQR] number of segments involved by bronchiectasis (5 [2-9] vs. 7 [4-11]) was significantly lower in the ABPA-elderly (P = .001). The proportion of subjects experiencing ABPA exacerbations was significantly (P = .047) lower in the elderly (25.6%) vs. the non-elderly (40.8%). There was also a tendency towards a lower mean number of exacerbations in the elderly (155 vs. 208 exacerbation per 1000 person-years) than the non-elderly (P = .09). There was also a trend towards longer mean time to first exacerbation in the ABPA-elderly than the non-elderly (1612 vs. 1159 days).  Conclusion:   ABPA was uncommon in the elderly.

This study aimed to disclose practical issues that affect the prevalence of these viral infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS All medical records with laboratory findings during 2016 to 2018 were reviewed, and all relevant data were extracted. All HBV and HCV infections were followed within these 3 years and investigated in detail. RESULTS The total number of records was 103 197, with a male to female ratio of 1: 1.4. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was tested in 12 934 cases, with a male to female ratio of 1: 2.6. Anti-HCV antibody (anti-HCV Ab) testing was done in 475 cases (53% male). The seroprevalence of HBV and HCV was 5.2% and 4.4%, respectively. Chronic HBV and HCV infections and their life-threatening complication, liver cancer, were highly detected in men aged 41-60 years. CONCLUSIONS HBsAg was highly screened in women owing to the nationwide implementation of the universal HBsAg screening in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission. Screening for anti-HCV Ab was neglected, probably due to lack of vaccine and high costs of anti-HCV drugs, which most people in low- to middle-income countries generally cannot afford. Local practices under national health care policies and limited budget and resources can cause underestimation of the prevalence of the HBV and HCV infections and persistent transmission of these viruses owing to unidentified cases.""","""['Veeravan Lekskulchai']""","""[' Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok, Thailand.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Med Sci Monit Basic Res""","""['Prevalence and associated risk factors for hepatitis B and C viruses among refugee populations living in Mahama, Rwanda: A cross-sectional study.', 'Prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis B and C virus infections in an impoverished urban community in Dhaka, Bangladesh.', ""Epidemiology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnant women in Sana'a, Yemen."", 'Infection with hepatitis B and C virus in Europe: a systematic review of prevalence and cost-effectiveness of screening.', 'Epidemiology of hepatitis B, C and D in Malawi: systematic review.']"""

Sleep problems have also been linked with survival in women with breast cancer. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of insomnia in breast cancers survivors, clarify the clinical characteristics of their sleep difficulties and use machine learning techniques to explore clinical insights.  Methods:   Our analysis of data, obtained in a nationwide questionnaire survey of breast cancer survivors in Japan, revealed a prevalence of suspected insomnia of 37.5%. With the clinical data obtained, we then used machine learning algorithms to develop a classifier that predicts comorbid insomnia. The performance of the prediction model was evaluated using 8-fold cross-validation.  Results:   When using optimal hyperparameters, the L2 penalized logistic regression model and the XGBoost model provided predictive accuracy of 71.5 and 70.6% for the presence of suspected insomnia, with areas under the curve of 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Population segments with high risk of insomnia were also extracted using the RuleFit algorithm. We found that cancer-related fatigue is a predictor of insomnia in breast cancer survivors.  Conclusions:   The high prevalence of sleep problems and its link with mortality warrants routine screening. Our novel predictive model using a machine learning approach offers clinically important insights for the early detection of comorbid insomnia and intervention in breast cancer survivors.""","""['Taro Ueno', 'Daisuke Ichikawa', 'Yoichi Shimizu', 'Tomomi Narisawa', 'Katsunori Tsuji', 'Eisuke Ochi', 'Naomi Sakurai', 'Hiroji Iwata', 'Yutaka J Matsuoka']""","""[' SUSMED, Inc, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Division of Health Care Research, Behavioral Science and Survivorship Research Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center Japan, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Division of Nursing, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Faculty of Bioscience and Applied Chemistry, Hosei University, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Cancer Solutions, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Department of Breast Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Insomnia and Susceptibility to Depressive Symptoms and Fatigue in Diverse Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'Understanding sleep disturbances in African-American breast cancer survivors: a pilot study.', 'Symptom trajectories in breast cancer survivors: growth mixture analysis of patient-reported pain, fatigue, insomnia, breast and arm symptoms.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'Sleep health in young women with breast cancer: a narrative review.', 'Artificial intelligence empowered digital health technologies in cancer survivorship care: A scoping review.']"""

Despite increasing reports of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in routine surveillance, information on the transmission of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains is largely unknown. This study elucidated the genetic diversity and transmission of MDR M. tuberculosis strains in Lusaka, Zambia.  Methods:   Eighty-five MDR M. tuberculosis samples collected from 2013 to 2017 at the University Teaching Hospital were used. Drug-resistance associated gene sequencing, spoligotyping, 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR), and multiplex PCR for RD-Rio sub-lineage identification were applied.  Results:   The identified clades were LAM (48%), CAS (29%), T (14%), X (6%) and Harlem (2%). Strains belonging to SITs 21/CAS1-Kili and 20/LAM1 formed the largest clonal complexes. Combined spoligotyping and 24 loci-MIRU-VNTR revealed 47 genotypic patterns with a clustering rate of 63%. Ninety-five percent of LAM strains belonged to the RD-Rio sub-lineage.  Conclusion:   The high clustering rate suggested that a large proportion of MDR-TB was due to recent transmission rather than the independent acquisition of MDR. This spread was attributed to clonal expansion of SIT21/CAS1-Kili and SIT20/LAM1 strains. Therefore, TB control programs recommending genotyping coupled with conventional epidemiological methods can guide measures for stopping the spread of MDR-TB.""","""['Joseph Yamweka Chizimu', 'Eddie Samuneti Solo', 'Precious Bwalya', 'Thoko Flav Kapalamula', 'Mwangala Lonah Akapelwa', 'Patrick Lungu', 'Dipti Shrestha', 'Yukari Fukushima', 'Victor Mukonka', 'Jeewan Thapa', 'Chie Nakajima', 'Yasuhiko Suzuki']""","""[' Division of Bioresources, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; Zambia National Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Lusaka, Zambia.', ' Division of Bioresources, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; University Teaching Hospital, Ministry of Health, Lusaka, Zambia.', ' Division of Bioresources, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', ' National TB Control Program, Ministry of Health, Lusaka, Zambia.', ' Division of Bioresources, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; Department of Microbiology, Kathmandu College of Science & Technology, Kathmandu, Nepal.', ' Zambia National Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health, Lusaka, Zambia.', ' Division of Bioresources, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; International Collaboration Unit, Hokkaido University International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.

However, EWAS of PM2.5 elements (PEs), reflecting different emission sources, are very limited.  Objectives:   We performed EWAS of short- and intermediate-term exposure to PM2.5 and 13 PEs. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNAm may vary by PM2.5 mass and its elements.  Methods:   We repeatedly collected blood samples in the Normative Aging Study and measured leukocyte DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. We collected daily PM2.5 and 13 PEs at a fixed central site. To estimate the associations between each PE and DNAm at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, we incorporated a distributed-lag (0-27 d) term in the setting of median regression with subject-specific intercept and examined cumulative lag associations. We also accounted for selection bias due to loss to follow-up and mortality prior to enrollment. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We further conducted regional and pathway analyses to identify significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and pathways.  Results:   We included 695 men with 1,266 visits between 1999 and 2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The significant DMPs, DMRs, and pathways varied by to PM2.5 total mass and PEs. For example, PM2.5 total mass was associated with 2,717 DMPs and 10,470 DMRs whereas Pb was associated with 3,173 DMPs and 637 DMRs. The identified pathways by PM2.5 mass were mostly involved in mood disorders, neuroplasticity, immunity, and inflammation, whereas the pathways associated with motor vehicles (BC, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were related with cardiovascular disease and cancer (e.g., ""PPARs signaling"").

Proenkephalin (PENK), a stable surrogate, is associated with heart failure (HF) development after myocardial infarction and worse cardiorenal function and prognosis in patients with HF. The association between plasma PENK concentrations and new-onset HF in the general population remains to be established.  Hypothesis:   We hypothesized that plasma PENK concentrations are associated with new-onset HF in the general population.  Methods:   We included 6677 participants from the prevention of renal and vascular end-stage disease study and investigated determinants of PENK concentrations and their association with new-onset HF (both reduced [HFrEF] and preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]).  Results:   Median PENK concentrations were 52.7 (45.1-61.9) pmol/L. Higher PENK concentrations were associated with poorer renal function and higher NT-proBNP concentrations. The main determinants of higher PENK concentrations were lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lower urinary creatinine excretion, and lower body mass index (all p < .001). After a median 8.3 (7.8-8.8) years follow-up, 221 participants developed HF; 127 HFrEF and 94 HFpEF. PENK concentrations were higher in subjects who developed HF compared with those who did not, 56.2 (45.2-67.6) versus 52.7 (45.1-61.6) pmol/L, respectively (p = .003). In competing-risk analyses, higher PENK concentrations were associated with higher risk of new-onset HF (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.09[1.47-2.97], p < .001), including both HFrEF (HR = 2.31[1.48-3.61], p < .001) and HFpEF (HR = 1.74[1.02-2.96], p = .042).

Despite the availability of several TB stigma scales, most high-TB burden countries do not have a culturally validated version available. This study evaluated the Van Rie TB stigma scale (VTSS) among people with TB in Vietnam.  Methods:   This study consisted of two phases. In phase 1, the VTSS was culturally and linguistically adapted to the Vietnamese context. In phase 2, people with TB were invited to complete a survey containing the VTSS, a depression scale, and a quality of life scale. The data analysis included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), construct validity, and floor or ceiling effects.  Results:   In phase 1, items were reworded from the third person to the first person. The TB/HIV co-infection items (items 7 and 11) were the least relevant for people with TB (62% and 73% relevance, respectively). In phase 2, the CFA demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit indices (GFI = 0.88, CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.058); however several of the item factor loadings were low. The EFA demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.85) and revealed one dominant factor. Construct validity was low.  Conclusions:   The VTSS demonstrated good psychometric properties in Vietnam.

Nonetheless, recommended PA guidelines from the World Health Organization are not met by many older adults. To increase PA, influencing factors have been investigated. But it is still unknown how the onset or disappearance of pain within an individual is associated with different PA intensities in older men and women.  Method:   We used longitudinal data from the nationwide representative German Ageing Survey, waves 2014 and 2017 (analytical sample, n = 6194, 45% women). PA was assessed with questions on low, moderate, and vigorous PA per week and converted into metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values. Pain was dichotomized from a 5-point scale into no pain versus some pain. The association between the onset or disappearance of pain from 2014 to 2017 on total, vigorous, moderate, and low PA was investigated using sex stratified asymmetric fixed effects models.  Results:   The onset of pain in older men (ß = 977.84, P = 0.041), and the disappearance of pain in older women (ß = 1531.69, P = 0.025), were associated with increased total PA. The results for men were driven by increases in vigorous (ß = 592.62, P = 0.035) PA, while the change in women was driven by low (ß = 242.16, P = 0.020) and moderate (ß = 496.48, P = 0.034) PA intensities. However, the observed differences between men and women were not statistically significant.

Local-level awareness of the opioid epidemic and political consequences""","""The opioid epidemic has had a profound effect on American public health, and studies suggest it has had a profound effect on American politics as well. Research suggests a relationship between the severity of the opioid crisis in a community and aggregate-level political behavior, including voting for Donald Trump in 2016, but there is very little individual-level data establishing the mechanism for this relationship. Using a question on a nationally representative survey fielded after the 2018 election, we explore Americans' perceptions of the severity of the opioid epidemic in their community, and whether these perceptions predict political behavior and attitudes. We find that relative estimates of local opioid overdoses are significantly influenced by the actual county-level overdose death rate, and that the relationship between reality and perception is strongest for the most knowledgeable and informed citizens. There is also evidence that the social construction of the opioid epidemic as a crisis primarily affecting White suburban or rural Americans affects these perceptions, as both White and non-urban respondents are significantly more attentive to objective mortality rates than others. Turning to political behavior, we find no evidence that these estimates affected validated voter turnout or U.S. House vote choice in the 2018 midterm election. Assessing public approval outcomes, we found a nonlinear effect of these estimates on support for President Trump, a pattern which is partially consistent with the existing literature. We also observed that those who believed the opioid epidemic to be worse than average in their communities reported lower approval of their state legislatures, though we found no such relationship for ratings of governors. These findings raise important questions about the micro-level mechanisms that link aggregate-level public health with political outcomes.""","""['Sarah E Gollust', 'Jake Haselswerdt']""","""[' Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, 420 Delaware Street SE, MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.

Aim:   To assess volunteer availability, interventions provided and frequency of probable post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by responders receiving a smartphone alert.  Methods:   A web-based survey was emailed to alerted responders at week-two post-alert and a PTSD screening survey at week-six, in Victoria, Australia (1/08/2019-8/11/2020), and in New Zealand (18/02/2020-28/10/2020).  Results:   We received 1,985 responses to the week-two survey and 1,443 responses to the week-six survey. Of the 1,985 responders, 1,744 (87.9%) had completed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training in the last twelve months, and 1,514 (76.3%) had performed CPR at least once. The alert was seen by 1,501 (75.6%) responders, 749 (37.7%) accepted the alert, 538 (27.1%) arrived on scene, and 283 (14.3%) provided care to the patient. In the multivariable analysis, CPR training within twelve months was associated with increased odds of responders accepting alerts (AOR 1.41, 95%CI: 1.02-1.96; p=0.040). Responders who had performed CPR before, were more than twice as likely to provide patient care compared to responders who had not (AOR 2.54, 95%CI: 1.56-4.12; p<0.001). One responder screened positive for probable PTSD.  Conclusion:   Acceptance rates in Australia and New Zealand were consistent with other smartphone apps. Responder recruitment should be targeted at those with medical backgrounds who have prior CPR experience, as they are more likely to provide care. The very low risk of PTSD is reassuring information when recruiting volunteers.""","""['Brian Haskins', 'Ziad Nehme', 'Bridget Dicker', 'Mark H Wilson', 'Michael Ray', 'Stephen Bernard', 'Peter Cameron', 'Karen Smith']""","""[' NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Pre-hospital Emergency Care Australia and NZ (PEC-ANZ), Monash University, St Kilda, Victoria, Australia; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Prahran, Victoria, Australia; Department of Paramedicine, Monash University, Frankston, Victoria, Australia.

High levels of fatigue were reported in one-third of the shifts evaluated. The main predictors of high fatigue were workload estimates, working evening shifts, and baseline fatigue. Among the six dimensions of workload, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. These results suggest that managers and supervisors should consider cognitive workload as a key contributing factor to fatigue in complex manual assembly.

In consequence, shellfish and seawater are considered its main reservoirs. However, there is one aspect of its biology that is systematically overlooked: its association with fish in its natural environment. This association led in 1975 to the emergence of a zoonotic clade within phylogenetic lineage 2 following successive outbreaks of vibriosis in farmed eels. Although this clade is now worldwide distributed, no new zoonotic clades were subsequently reported. In this work, we have performed phylogenetic, genomic and functional studies to show that other zoonotic clades are in fact present in 4 of the 5 lineages of the species. Further, we associate these clades, most of them previously but incompletely described, with the acquisition of a family of fish virulence plasmids containing genes essential for resistance to the immune system of certain teleosts of interest in aquaculture. Consequently, our results provide several pieces of evidence about the importance of this species as a zoonotic agent linked to fish farms, as well as on the relevance of these artificial environments acting as drivers that accelerate the evolution of the species.""","""['Héctor Carmona-Salido', 'Belén Fouz', 'Eva Sanjuán', 'Miguel Carda', 'Christian M J Delannoy', 'Neris García-González', 'Fernando González-Candelas', 'Carmen Amaro']""","""[' Departamento de Microbiología y Ecología, & Estructura de Recerca Interdisciplinar en Biotecnologia i Biomedicina (ERI BIOTECMED), Universitat de València.

Tooth loss negatively affects the overall physical and social well-being of older adults. Understanding the role of socio-demographic and other predictors associated with tooth loss that are measured in non-clinical settings can be useful in community-level prevention. We used high-dimensional epidemiological data to investigate important factors in predicting tooth loss among older adults over a 6-year period of follow-up. Data was from participants of 2010 and 2016 waves of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES). A total of 19,407 community-dwelling functionally independent older adults aged 65 and older were included in the analysis. Tooth loss was measured as moving from a higher number of teeth category at the baseline to a lower number of teeth category at the follow-up. Out of 119 potential predictors, age, sex, number of teeth, denture use, chewing difficulty, household income, employment, education, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, community participation, time since last health check-up, having a hobby, and feeling worthless were selected using Boruta algorithm. Within the 6-year follow-up, 3013 individuals (15.5%) reported incidence of tooth loss. People who experienced tooth loss were older (72.9 ± 5.2 vs 71.8 ± 4.7), and predominantly men (18.3% vs 13.1%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning prediction model had a mean accuracy of 90.5% (±0.9%). A visual analysis of machine learning predictions revealed that the prediction of tooth loss was mainly driven by demographic (older age), baseline oral health (having 10-19 teeth, wearing dentures), and socioeconomic (lower household income, manual occupations) variables. Predictors related to wide a range of determinants contribute towards tooth loss among older adults. In addition to oral health related and demographic factors, socioeconomic factors were important in predicting future tooth loss. Understanding the behaviour of these predictors can thus be useful in developing prevention strategies for tooth loss among older adults.""","""['Upul Cooray', 'Richard G Watt', 'Georgios Tsakos', 'Anja Heilmann', 'Masanori Hariyama', 'Takafumi Yamamoto', 'Isuruni Kuruppuarachchige', 'Katsunori Kondo', 'Ken Osaka', 'Jun Aida']""","""[' Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai, Japan.

Quantitative studies consistently indicate that women play a prominent role in the informal surveillance of their partners' drinking. This paper aims to contribute to the evidence-base by examining possible meanings and reasons underpinning the surveillance of drinking in the early parenting period. In doing so, we draw from the results of a study conducted in Yorkshire (UK), exploring accounts of alcohol drinking practices in women up to three years after giving birth. This is a phase of family readjustment, in which childcare is at its most time- and labour-intensive. Free Association Narrative Interviews (FANI) were conducted between 2017 and 2018 with 21 working mothers from different backgrounds, each interviewed twice about daily routines and drinking practices. Narrative and thematic content analysis cast light on the gendered aspects of surveillance of alcohol consumption. Participants described seeking to exert informal surveillance over their partners' drinking and to set boundaries around what was considered an acceptable level of consumption. Their accounts reflected how traditional gender performances and expectations were relationally constructed through drinking practices. Women's attempts at surveillance were generally articulated in non-confrontational language. However, in the interviews, women expressed disappointment and unhappiness that partners' drinking activities were associated with an unequal distribution of domestic responsibilities. Through informal surveillance of drinking, we argue, women performed actions of health-risk management within the family. Most importantly, informal surveillance appeared to be a strategy which sought to negotiate a fairer allocation of household labour, and greater equity between the partners. Findings demonstrates how inequalities in power play out and permeate intimate relationships, re-affirming women's traditional role in the regulation of drinking. Drinking practices, we conclude, provide valuable insights into how gender operates in the sphere of intimacy.""","""['Serena Vicario', 'Marian Peacock', 'Penny Buykx', 'Petra Sylvia Meier', 'Paul Bissell']""","""[' University of Sheffield, School of Health and Related Research, UK; AULSS 6 Euganea, Addiction Department - Padova, Italy.

This study investigated perceptions of, and motivations for, alcohol consumption during pregnancy and associated practices in a rural district of Lesotho.  Methods:   A combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods were used to identify pregnant women and mothers with young children from the general community, as well as from alcohol-serving venues. Between September 2016 and March 2017, a trained data collector conducted in-depth interviews with 40 women on reasons why pregnant women drink, what they know about the risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and perceptions of women who drink during pregnancy.  Results:   Sixty-five percent of women (n = 26) reported that they consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Findings were clustered into four themes: 1) alcohol use in daily and cultural life; 2) alcohol as relief from stress and hunger; 3) alcohol's effect on the baby; and 4) access to information about alcohol consumption. Our data suggest that alcohol use was a prominent feature of daily life and a key part of traditional events and ceremonies. Other than potentially harming the baby through falling on their stomachs while inebriated, women did not mention other risks associated with prenatal alcohol use. Rather, there were prominent beliefs that drinking alcohol - home-brewed alcohol in particular - had cleansing or protective benefits for the baby. Experiences of food insecurity were prominent, and women reported that alcohol helped curb their hunger and allowed them to save food to give to their children.  Conclusions:   Within this context of chronic poverty and food insecurity, alcohol use during pregnancy will continue to represent a valid, though tragic choice if the structural conditions and current social arrangements that facilitate prenatal alcohol use remain unchanged.""","""['Marguerite Marlow', 'Hope Christie', 'Sarah Skeen', 'Stephan Rabie', 'Jacobus G Louw', 'Leslie Swartz', 'Shoeshoe Mofokeng', 'Moroesi Makhetha', 'Mark Tomlinson']""","""[' Institute for Life Course Health Research, Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University, Office 4009, 4th Floor, Education Building, Francie van Zijl Drive, Tygerberg, 7505, South Africa.

The goal is to contribute to the discussion about the potential infrastructure requirements of implementing screening programs among screening 'hesitant' cancer care services. Secondary analysis showed a general downward distress trajectory though the greatest reduction occurred between recruitment and baseline and before receiving a low-intensity psychosocial intervention (β = - 1.84, 95% CI - 2.12, - 1.56).

It is not known how the pandemic has affected clinicians who provide care to these communities through safety-net practices, including clinicians participating in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC).  Methods:   In late 2020, we surveyed clinicians who were serving in the NHSC as of July 1, 2020, in 20 states. Clinicians reported on work and job changes and their current well-being, among other measures. Analyses adjusted for differences in subgroup response rates and clustering of clinicians within practices.  Results:   Of 4263 surveyed clinicians, 1890 (44.3%) responded. Work for most NHSC clinicians was affected by the pandemic, including 64.5% whose office visit numbers fell by half and 62.5% for whom most visits occurred virtually. Fewer experienced changes in their jobs; for example, only 14.9% had been furloughed. Three-quarters (76.6%) of these NHSC clinicians scored in at-risk levels for their well-being. Compared with primary care and behavioral health clinicians, dental clinicians much more often had been furloughed and had their practices close temporarily.  Conclusions:   The pandemic has disrupted the work, jobs, and mental health of NHSC clinicians in ways similar to its reported effects on outpatient clinicians generally. Because clinicians' mental health worsens after a pandemic, which leads to patient disengagement and job turnover, national programs and policies should help safety-net practices build cultures that support and give greater priority to clinicians' work, job, and mental health needs now and before the next pandemic.""","""['Donald E Pathman', 'Jeffrey Sonis', 'Jerry N Harrison', 'Robert G Sewell', 'Jackie Fannell', 'Marc Overbeck', 'Thomas R Konrad']""","""[' Department of Family Medicine, Cecil G.

Light-intensity breaks in sitting could be a promising alternative. We compared the acute effects of active breaks in sitting with those of moderate-to-vigorous exercise on cardiometabolic risk markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a crossover fashion, 15 women with rheumatoid arthritis underwent three 8-h experimental conditions: prolonged sitting (SIT), 30-min bout of moderate-to-vigorous exercise followed by prolonged sitting (EX), and 3-min bouts of light-intensity walking every 30 min of sitting (BR). Postprandial glucose, insulin, c-peptide, triglycerides, cytokines, lipid classes/subclasses (lipidomics), and blood pressure responses were assessed. Muscle biopsies were collected following each session to assess targeted proteins/genes. Glucose [-28% in area under the curve (AUC), P = 0.036], insulin (-28% in AUC, P = 0.016), and c-peptide (-27% in AUC, P = 0.006) postprandial responses were attenuated in BR versus SIT, whereas only c-peptide was lower in EX versus SIT (-20% in AUC, P = 0.002). IL-1β decreased during BR, but increased during EX and SIT (P = 0.027 and P = 0.085, respectively). IL-1ra was increased during EX versus BR (P = 0.002). TNF-α concentrations decreased during BR versus EX (P = 0.022). EX, but not BR, reduced systolic blood pressure (P = 0.013). Lipidomic analysis showed that 7 of 36 lipid classes/subclasses were significantly different between conditions, with greater changes being observed in EX. No differences were observed for protein/gene expression. Brief active breaks in sitting can offset markers of cardiometabolic disturbance, which may be particularly useful for patients who may find it difficult to adhere to exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exercise is a treatment in rheumatoid arthritis but is challenging for some patients. Light-intensity breaks in sitting could be a promising alternative. Our findings show beneficial, but differential, cardiometabolic effects of active breaks in sitting and exercise in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Breaks in sitting mainly improved glycemic and inflammatory markers, whereas exercise improved lipidomic and hypotensive responses.

This study explores the extent to which we can use social media and internet search queries to understand whether the federal calorie labeling law increased awareness of calories. To evaluate the association of the federal menu labeling law with tweeting about calories we retrieved tweets that contained the term ""calorie(s)"" from the CompEpi Geo Twitter Database from 1 January through 31 December in 2016 and 2018. Within the same time period, we also retrieved time-series data for search queries related to calories via Google Trends (GT). Interrupted time-series analysis was used to test whether the federal menu labeling law was associated with a change in mentions of ""calorie(s)"" on Twitter and relative search queries to calories on GT. Before the implementation of the federal calorie labeling law on 7 May 2018, there was a significant decrease in the baseline trend of 4.37 × 10-8 (SE = 1.25 × 10-8, p < 0.001) mean daily ratio of calorie(s) tweets. A significant increase in post-implementation slope of 3.19 × 10-8 (SE = 1.34 × 10-8 , p < 0.018) mean daily ratio of calorie(s) tweets was seen compared to the pre-implementation slope. An interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis showed a small, statistically significant upward trend of 0.0043 (SE = 0.036, p < 0.001) weekly search queries for calories pre-implementation, with no significant level change post-implementation. There was a decrease in trend of 1.22 (SE = 0.27, p < 0.001) in search queries for calories post-implementation. The federal calorie labeling law was associated with a 173% relative increase in the trend of mean daily ratio of tweets and a -28381% relative change in trend for search queries for calories. Twitter results demonstrate an increase in awareness of calories because of the addition of menu labels. Google Trends results imply that fewer people are searching for the calorie content of their meal, which may no longer be needed since calorie information is provided at point of purchase. Given our findings, discussions online about calories may provide a signal of an increased awareness in the implementation of calorie labels.""","""['Yulin Hswen', 'Alyssa J Moran', 'Siona Prasad', 'Anna Li', 'Denise Simon', 'Lauren Cleveland', 'Jared B Hawkins', 'John S Brownstein', 'Jason Block']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.', ' Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.', ' Computational Epidemiology Lab, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', "" Innovation Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", ' Department of Health Policy and Management, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MA 21205, USA.', ' Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', ' Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Changes in the calorie and nutrient content of purchased fast food meals after calorie menu labeling: A natural experiment.', 'Estimating the effect of calorie menu labeling on calories purchased in a large restaurant franchise in the southern United States: quasi-experimental study.', 'Changes in Calorie Content of Menu Items at Large Chain Restaurants After Implementation of Calorie Labels.', 'Menu labeling regulations and calories purchased at chain restaurants.', 'A Systematic Review of Calorie Labeling and Modified Calorie Labeling Interventions: Impact on Consumer and Restaurant Behavior.', 'Analysis of Content, Social Networks, and Sentiment of Front-of-Pack Nutrition Labeling in the European Union on Twitter.']"""

Positive associations have been also reported between character strengths and physical fitness, self-reported physical and mental health. Yet, evidence with large scale, epidemiological data on the role of character strength of honesty and integrity (CSHI) in shaping subsequent health outcomes and daily functioning remains unexplored. We examined whether the character strength of honesty and integrity was prospectively associated with six physical health outcomes, two depression outcomes, and two daily functioning outcomes. We used data from the Health and Retirement Study obtained from a sample of 9813 older adults. We found that after a 4-year follow-up period, compared with individuals who scored the lowest in CSHI, participants who scored in the third tertile had a 18% lower risk of lung disease (RR = 0.824; 95% CI = 0.732; 0.927), and a 11% lower risk of depression (RR = 0.891; 95% CI = 0.806; 0.986).

These associations were independent of demographics, prior socioeconomic status, psychological factors, health conditions, and health behaviors.

Existing literature demonstrates diverse tools being used, with the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and its versions being the most common. The Malaysian Elder Mistreatment Project (MAESTRO) utilized the Modified CTS developed and used by the National Study of Elder Abuse and Neglect in Ireland (NSEA-I). This article aimed to validate this Malay version of the modified CTS for use in the Malaysian context and by Malay-speaking populations across Southeast Asia while highlighting the various practical and methodological challenges encountered along the process. Data were collected from 1927 older respondents who lived in Kuala Pilah district. Preliminary data screening led to the dropping of 10 items due to 0 variance.

Therefore, co-infection of genetically diverse avian influenza viruses in poultry may pose a significant public health risk in generating novel reassortants with increased zoonotic potential. This study investigated the reassortment patterns of a Pearl River Delta-lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and four genetically divergent avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses upon co-infection in embryonated chicken eggs and chickens. To characterize ""within-host"" and ""between-host"" genetic diversity, we further monitored the viral genotypes that were subsequently transmitted to contact chickens in serial transmission experiments. We observed that co-infection with A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) viruses may lead to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses in ovo and in chickens, albeit with different reassortment patterns. Novel reassortants detected in donor chickens co-infected with different combinations of the same A(H7N9) virus and different A(H9N2) viruses showed distinct onward transmission potential to contact chickens. Sequential transmission of novel reassortant viruses was only observed in one out of four co-infection combinations. Our results demonstrated different patterns by which influenza viruses may acquire genetic diversity through co-infection in ovo, in vivo, and under sequential transmission conditions.""","""['Wen Su', 'Sin Fun Sia', 'Ka-Tim Choy', 'Yue Ji', 'Dongdong Chen', 'Eric Ho Yin Lau', 'Guanghua Fu', 'Yu Huang', 'Jinhua Liu', 'Malik Peiris', 'Juan Pu', 'Hui-Ling Yen']""","""["" School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China."", "" Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou, People's Republic of China."", "" Key Laboratory of Animal Epidemiology and Zoonosis, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Emerg Microbes Infect""","""['The Origin of Internal Genes Contributes to the Replication and Transmission Fitness of H7N9 Avian Influenza Virus.', 'Coinfection of Chickens with H9N2 and H7N9 Avian Influenza Viruses Leads to Emergence of Reassortant H9N9 Virus with Increased Fitness for Poultry and a Zoonotic Potential.', 'High frequency of reassortment after co-infection of chickens with the H4N6 and H9N2 influenza A viruses and the biological characteristics of the reassortants.', 'Occurrence and reassortment of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses derived from coinfected birds in China.', 'Natural Reassortants of Potentially Zoonotic Avian Influenza Viruses H5N1 and H9N2 from Egypt Display Distinct Pathogenic Phenotypes in Experimentally Infected Chickens and Ferrets.', 'The Origin of Internal Genes Contributes to the Replication and Transmission Fitness of H7N9 Avian Influenza Virus.', 'A dominant internal gene cassette of high pathogenicity avian influenza H7N9 virus raised since 2018.']"""

However, little is known about the patterns of feeding practices used by groups of mothers or how these groupings of practices influence children's dietary intake. Therefore, the aims of this study are to classify and describe groups of mothers according to their patterns of feeding practices and to examine the associations between the groups of maternal feeding practices and pre-school children's dietary quality. In 2018, 1349 mothers based in Australia of children aged 2-5 years completed an online survey including validated measures of nine feeding practices and dietary quality, measured using thirteen summed dietary items. Latent profile analysis was used to identify distinct groups of mothers who shared similar feeding practices. Linear regression models were fitted to examine associations between the feeding practice profiles and child dietary quality. A three-profile model was chosen based on interpretation, profile size and statistical model fit criteria. Profile 1 had lower mean scores of structure-related feeding practices than the other profiles; profile 2 had mean scores reflecting slightly higher use of most structure-related feeding practices and lower mean scores of some non-responsive feeding practices; profile 3 had higher mean scores of non-responsive feeding practices than the other profiles. Profile 1 (-2.95, CI: 3.97; -1.92) and profile 3 (-2.81, CI: 3.49; -2.13) had lower mean child dietary quality scores compared with profile 2. Profile 2, which reflected the most engagement in structure-related feeding practices combined with least non-responsive feeding practices, was associated with higher child diet quality, compared with the other two profiles.

The disease ecology is poorly understood, despite the large global burden of disease. The key determinants of high-risk areas of transmission to humans are unknown.  Methods:   Small mammals and chiggers were collected over an 18-month period at three sites of differing ecological profiles with high scrub typhus transmission in Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand. Field samples were identified and tested for Orientia tsutsugamushi by real-time PCR. The rates and dynamics of infection were recorded, and positive and negative individuals were mapped over time at the scale of single villages. Ecological analyses were performed to describe the species richness, community structure and interactions between infected and uninfected species and habitats. Generalised linear modelling (GLM) was applied to examine these interactions.  Results:   The site with the highest rates of human infection was associated with the highest number of infected chigger pools (41%), individual chiggers (16%), proportion of the known vector species Leptotrombidium deliense (71%) and chigger index (151). Chigger species diversity was lowest (Shannon diversity index H': 1.77) and rodent density appeared to be high. There were no consistent discrete foci of infection identified at any of the study sites. The small mammals Rattus tanezumi and Bandicota indica and the chiggers L. deliense and Walchia kritochaeta emerged as central nodes in the network analysis. In the GLM, the end of the dry season, and to a lesser extent the end of the wet season, was associated with O. tsutsugamushi-infected small mammals and chiggers. A clear positive association was seen between O. tsutsugamushi-positive chigger pools and the combination of O. tsutsugamushi-positive chigger pools and O. tsutsugamushi-positive small mammals with lowland habitats.  Conclusions:   These findings begin to reveal some of the factors that may determine high-risk foci of scrub typhus at a fine local scale. Understanding these factors may allow practical public health interventions to reduce disease risk. Further studies are needed in areas with diverse ecology.""","""['Ivo Elliott', 'Neeranuch Thangnimitchok', 'Kittipong Chaisiri', 'Tri Wangrangsimakul', 'Piangnet Jaiboon', 'Nicholas P J Day', 'Daniel H Paris', 'Paul N Newton', 'Serge Morand']""","""[' Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit, Microbiology Laboratory, Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Lao PDR. ivo.elliott@ndm.ox.ac.uk.', ' Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. ivo.elliott@ndm.ox.ac.uk.', ' Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit, Microbiology Laboratory, Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Lao PDR.', ' Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', ' Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', ' Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', ' Department of Medicine, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland.', ' Department of Clinical Research, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ' CNRS ISEM-CIRAD ASTRE, Faculty of Veterinary Technology, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""Parasit Vectors""","""['Surveillance of potential hosts and vectors of scrub typhus in Taiwan.', 'Scrub typhus: vector competence of Leptotrombidium chiangraiensis chiggers and transmission efficacy and isolation of Orientia tsutsugamushi.', 'Abundance & distribution of trombiculid mites & Orientia tsutsugamushi, the vectors & pathogen of scrub typhus in rodents & shrews collected from Puducherry & Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Scrub typhus ecology: a systematic review of Orientia in vectors and hosts.', 'Screening and genotyping of Orientia tsutsugamushi from field-collected on-host chiggers (Acari: Prostigmata) recovered from a positive scrub typhus locality in Kelantan, Malaysia.', 'Molecular Surveillance for Vector-Borne Bacteria in Rodents and Tree Shrews of Peninsular Malaysia Oil Palm Plantations.', 'Habitat and Season Drive Chigger Mite Diversity and Abundance on Small Mammals in Peninsular Malaysia.', 'Not Only Leptotrombidium spp. an Annotated Checklist of Chigger Mites (Actinotrichida: Trombiculidae) Associated with Bacterial Pathogens.', 'Orientia tsutsugamushi in Chiggers and Small Mammals in Laos.', 'The incidence of Orientia tsutsugamushi infection in rural South India.']"""

Using impedance-based measurements, crystal violet staining and traditional culture we have studied the biofilm growth dynamics of 13 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains under the effect of seven conventional antibiotics. Real-time growth quantifications revealed that the exposure of established P. aeruginosa biofilms to certain concentrations of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and tobramycin induced the emergence of persister cells, that showed different morphology and pigmentation, as well increased antibiotic resistance. Whole-genome sequencing of wildtype and persister cells identified several SNPs, a genomic inversion and a genomic duplication in one of the strains. However, these mutations were not uniquely associated with persisters, suggesting that the persistent phenotype may be related to metabolic and transcriptional changes. Given that mannitol has been proposed to activate bacterial metabolism, the synergistic combination of mannitol and ciprofloxacin was evaluated on clinical 48 h P. aeruginosa biofilms. When administered at doses ≥320 mg/L, mannitol was capable of preventing persister cell formation by efficiently activating dormant bacteria and making them susceptible to the antibiotic. These results were confirmed using viable colony counting. As the tested ciprofloxacin-mannitol combination appeared to fully eradicate mature biofilms, we conclude that impedance-based biofilm diagnostics, which permits antibiotic susceptibility testing and the identification of persister cells, is of great potential for the clinical practice and could aid in establishing treatment breakpoints for emerging biofilm-related infections.""","""['Miglė Žiemytė', 'Miguel Carda-Diéguez', 'Juan C Rodríguez-Díaz', 'Maria P Ventero', 'Alex Mira', 'María D Ferrer']""","""[' Genomics & Health Department, FISABIO Foundation, Valencia, Spain.', ' Servicio de Microbiología, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, ISABIAL, Alicante, Spain.', ' CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health, Madrid, Spain.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Emerg Microbes Infect""","""['Sweetening Inhaled Antibiotic Treatment for Eradication of Chronic Respiratory Biofilm Infection.', 'Mannitol enhances antibiotic sensitivity of persister bacteria in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.', 'Efficacy of a ciprofloxacin/amikacin combination against planktonic and biofilm cultures of susceptible and low-level resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.', 'Human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Enhances Antibiotic Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Persister Cells.', 'Fighting bacterial persistence: Current and emerging anti-persister strategies and therapeutics.', 'Genome Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strains from Chronically Infected Patients with High Levels of Persister Formation.', 'Evolution of Bacterial Persistence to Antibiotics during a 50,000-Generation Experiment in an Antibiotic-Free Environment.']"""

The adverse consequences of emotional maltreatment and bullying behoove researchers to identify their causal mechanisms.  Objective:   We examined the reciprocal relations between emotional maltreatment and bullying perpetration/victimization and whether depressive symptoms functioned as mediator of the relations, after separating within-person effects from between-person effects.  Methods:   A total of 4273 Chinese early adolescents (45.2% girls; Mage = 9.90 years, SD = 0.73) participated in a five-wave longitudinal study with 6-month intervals.  Results:   Results from random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling showed: (a) emotional maltreatment and bullying perpetration were bidirectionally related; (b) bullying victimization directly predicted emotional maltreatment, but not vice versa; (c) emotional maltreatment indirectly predicted bullying perpetration/victimization via depressive symptoms; and (d) bullying victimization indirectly predicted emotional maltreatment via depressive symptoms.  Conclusions:   These findings provided evidence for bidirectional spillover effects in the family and peer domains, demonstrating that early adolescents may become trapped in a vicious cycle of negative relationships, directly or indirectly, via their depressive symptoms.

Little is known of the influence of geography and climate on its distribution, and so this study was conducted to determine geo-climatic factors by using geographic information system.  Methods:   The home addresses of patients with CL patients who were diagnosed and notified from 2009 to 2017 were retrieved from the provincial health center and registered on the village/town/city point layer. The effects of mean annual rainfall (MAR) and mean annual humidity (MAH), mean annual temperature (MAT), maximum annual temperature (MaxMAT), minimum annual temperature (MinMAT), mean annual number of high-velocity wind days (MAWD), mean annual frosty days (MAFD) and snowy days (MASD), elevation, soil type and land cover on CL distribution were examined. The geographical analysis was done using ArcMap software, and univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were applied to determine the factors associated with CL.  Results:   A total of 332 CL patients were identified: 197 (59.3%) male and 135 (40.7%) female. Their mean age was 29.3 ± 2.1 years, with age ranging from 10 months to 98 years. CL patients came from a total of 86 villages/towns/cities. By multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with increased CL were urban setting (OR = 52.102), agricultural land cover (OR = 3.048), and MAWD (OR = 1.004). Elevation was a protective factor only in the univariate analysis (OR = 0.999). Soil type, MAH, MAT, MinMAT, MaxMAT, and MAFD did not influence CL distribution in eastern Iran.  Conclusions:   The major risk zones for CL in eastern Iran were urban and agricultural areas with a higher number of windy days at lower altitudes. Control strategies to reduce human vector contact should be focused in these settings.""","""['Mehdi Karamian', 'Mohammad Amin Ghatee', 'Majid Shayesteh', 'Walter Robert Taylor', 'Saeed Mohebi-Nejad', 'Ghasem Taheri', 'Mohammad Reza Jamavar']""","""[' Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran. karamianm@yahoo.com.', ' Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. ghateea1980@gmail.com.', ' Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. ghateea1980@gmail.com.', ' Center for Disease Control, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', ' Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Bangkok, Thailand.', ' Oxford Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', ' Student Research Committee, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""Parasit Vectors""","""['Role of environmental, climatic risk factors and livestock animals on the occurrence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in newly emerging focus in Iran.', 'Effects of geographical and climatic factors on cystic echinococcosis in south-western Iran.', 'Distribution pattern of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica in Western Afghanistan during 2013-2014.', 'Changes in the Epidemiology of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Northeastern Iran.', 'The Geographical Distribution of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Causative Agents in Iran and Its Neighboring Countries, A Review.', 'Climate Variables Related to the Incidence of Human Leishmaniosis in Montenegro in Southeastern Europe during Seven Decades (1945-2014).']"""

Furthermore, emerging evidence has connected disordered intestinal microbiota to food allergies. Here, we investigated the impact of CS on a rat model for food allergy to ovalbumin (OVA). Rats delivered by CS were found to be more responsive to OVA sensitization than vaginally born ones, displaying a greater reduction in rectal temperature upon challenge, worse diarrhea, and higher levels of OVA-specific antibodies and histamine. 16S rRNA sequencing of feces revealed reduced levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the CS rats. Preventative supplementation with a probiotic combination containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium could protect CS rats against an allergic response to OVA, indicating that the microbiota dysbiosis contributes to CS-related response. Additionally, probiotic intervention early in life might help to rebuild aberrant Th2 responses and tight junction proteins, both of which have been linked to CS-related high allergic reactions. Taken together, this study shows that disordered intestinal microbiota plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of food allergy mediated by CS. More importantly, interventions that modulate the microbiota composition in early life are therapeutically relevant for CS-related food allergies.""","""['Bi-Ying Jin', 'Zhen Li', 'Ya-Nan Xia', 'Li-Xiang Li', 'Zi-Xiao Zhao', 'Xiao-Yu Li', 'Yan Li', 'Bing Li', 'Ru-Chen Zhou', 'Shi-Chen Fu', 'Shi-Yang Li', 'Yan-Qing Li']""","""[' Department of Gastroenterology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ' Laboratory of Translational Gastroenterology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ' Robot Engineering Laboratory for Precise Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ' Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Front Immunol""","""['Ongoing Supplementation of Probiotics to Cesarean-Born Neonates during the First Month of Life may Impact the Gut Microbial.', 'Effect of a Short-Time Probiotic Supplementation on the Abundance of the Main Constituents of the Gut Microbiota of Term Newborns Delivered by Cesarean Section-A Randomized, Prospective, Controlled Clinical Trial.', 'Oral administration of Lactobacillus plantarum JC7 alleviates OVA-induced murine food allergy through immunoregulation and restoring disordered intestinal microbiota.', 'Microbiota and Food Allergy.', 'Immunology and probiotic impact of the newborn and young children intestinal microflora.', 'Strategies for the Identification and Assessment of Bacterial Strains with Specific Probiotic Traits.']"""

Better understanding of the risk for development of AF is critical to implement optimal monitoring strategies with the goal of preventing recurrent stroke attributable to underlying AF. The RE-SPECT ESUS trial (Randomized, Double-Blind Evaluation in Secondary Stroke Prevention Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of the Oral Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran Etexilate Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) provides an opportunity to assess predictors for developing AF and associated recurrent stroke.  Methods:   RE-SPECT ESUS was a randomized, controlled trial (564 sites, 42 countries) assessing dabigatran versus aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Of 5390 patients enrolled and followed for a median of 19 months, 403 (7.5%) were found to develop AF reported as an adverse event or using cardiac monitoring per standard clinical care. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to define predictors of AF.  Results:   In the multivariable model, older age (odds ratio for 10-year increase, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.78-2.23]; P<0.001), hypertension (odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.03-1.79]; P=0.0304), diabetes (odds ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96]; P=0.022), and body mass index (odds ratio for 5-U increase, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.16-1.43]; P<0.001) were independent predictors of AF during the study. In a sensitivity analysis restricted to 1117 patients with baseline NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide) measurements, only older age and higher NT-proBNP were significant independent predictors of AF. Performance of several published predictive models was assessed, including HAVOC (AF risk score based on hypertension, age ≥75 years, valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease) and CHA2DS2-VASc (stroke risk score based on congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years [doubled], diabetes, previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, and sex category [female]) scores, and higher scores were associated with higher rates of developing AF.  Conclusions:   Besides age, the most important variable, several other factors, including hypertension, higher body mass index, and lack of diabetes, are independent predictors of AF after embolic stroke of undetermined source. When baseline NT-proBNP was available, only older age and elevation of this biomarker were predictive of subsequent AF. Understanding who is at higher risk of developing AF will assist in identifying patients who may benefit from more intense, long-term cardiac monitoring.

Nonetheless, there is still a scarcity of research on late-life cognitive function that accounted for multiple aspects of adverse events as well as the potential mediating mechanism of social context and individual's wellbeing in adulthood.  Objective:   This study aimed to investigate the relationship between childhood adversities and late-life cognitive function among the middle-aged and older Chinese population and to determine the mediating role of education attainment, marital status, financial status, and self-rated health in adulthood.  Methods:   We used three waves of data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2015, which consisted of 23 807 participants aged 45 years and older. Generalized Estimating Equation and Structural Equation Model were applied to examine the association between childhood adversities and cognitive function (mental intactness and episodic memory) and the corresponding potential mechanisms.  Results:   Overall, 77.25%, 64.55%, 38.38%, and 15.03% of respondents experienced socioeconomic disadvantage, parental involved trauma, maladaptive parental trauma, and other trauma in childhood, respectively. Multivariate analyses suggest that all four types of childhood adversities were associated with a lower score of mental intactness and the first three were associated with episodic memory. A large proportion of the associations between childhood adversity and cognitive function was mainly mediated by education attainment, self-rated health and marital status in adulthood.  Conclusion:   There are negative linkages between childhood adversities and cognitive function in the middle-aged and older Chinese population.

Study design and methods:   We screened 8798 asymptomatic donors presenting in Milan from July 2020 to February 2021 (10,680 presentations) before the vaccination campaign for anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibodies, and for anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies and nasopharyngeal swab PCR in those who tested positive.  Results:   The prevalence of anti-NP+/RBD+ tests increased progressively with time up to ~15% (p < .0001), preceded by a peak of PCR+ tests. Anti-RBD titers were higher in anti-NP IgG+/IgM+ than in IgG+/IgM- individuals and in those with a history of infection (p < .0001); of these 197/630 (31.2%) displayed high titers (>80 AU/ml). Anti-RBD titers declined during follow-up, depending on baseline titers (p < .0001) and time (p = .025). Risk factors for seroconversion were a later presentation date and non-O ABO blood group (p < .001). A positive PCR was detected in 0.7% of participants in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viremia.  Conclusions:   During the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy, we detected an increase in seroprevalence in healthy blood donors from ~4% to ~15%, with a trend paralleling that observed in the general population.

Knowledge about its determinants is therefore important, but due to the lack of longitudinal studies, such knowledge is limited. The aim of the present inquiry is to identify child and family predictors of future pediatric insomnia within a psycho-bio-behavioral framework.  Methods:   A representative community sample (n = 1,037) was followed biennially from 4 to 14 years of age (2007-2017). Insomnia was defined based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria and was diagnosed by a semistructured clinical interview of children (from age eight years of age) and parents (all ages). Predictors included parent ratings of child emotional reactivity, family functioning, and marital conflict; self-reports of personality; and teacher-rated emotion regulation skills.  Results:   Random intercept cross-lagged analyses revealed that within-person increases (ie, relative to the child's typical levels across childhood) in emotional reactivity and decreases in emotion regulation skills predicted insomnia diagnosis two years later from ages 4 to 14 after adjusting for previous insomnia and all unmeasured time-invariant factors. Previous insomnia was the strongest predictor of later insomnia, whereas family functioning and marital conflict did not predict insomnia.  Conclusions:   Increases in emotional reactivity and decreases in emotion regulation skills predicted insomnia above and beyond all unmeasured time-invariant factors and could be targets for interventions. Previous insomnia predicted later insomnia, thereby underscoring the importance of detecting, preventing, and treating insomnia at an early age.""","""['Jonas Falch-Madsen', 'Lars Wichstrøm', 'Ståle Pallesen', 'Bror M Ranum', 'Silje Steinsbekk']""","""[' Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

Methods:   Following forward/backward translations, the finalized Arabic version was administered to 149 patients (53 males-96 females, age 69.80 ± 10 years) receiving HMV. Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics and visited at home. The Arabic SRI and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered, in addition to questions on sociodemographics and medical history. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to explore dimensionality; internal consistency reliability of the unidimensional scale and its subscales was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. External nomological validity was examined by assessing the correlation between the SRI and SF-36 scores.  Results:   The 49-item Arabic SRI scale showed a high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha for the total scale was 0.897 and ranged between 0.73 and 0.87 for all subscales). Correlations between the SF-36-Mental Health Component MHC and SF-36-Physical Health Component with SRI-Summary Scale were 0.57 and 0.66, respectively, with higher correlations observed between the SF-36 and specific sub-scales such as the Physical Functioning and the Social Functioning subscales [r = 0.81 and r = 0.74 (P < 0.01), respectively].  Conclusion and recommendations:   The Arabic SRI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing HRQL in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency receiving home mechanical ventilation.""","""['Marwan F Alawieh', 'Rania N Bzeih#', 'Mohamad F El-Khatib', 'Abla M Sibai', 'Lilian A Ghandour', 'Salah M Zeineldine']""","""[' Department of Anesthesiology/Inhalation Therapy Department, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', ' Nursing Department, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. lg01@aub.edu.lb.', ' Internal Medicine - Pulmonary Division, American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), PO Box: 11-0236, Riad El Solh, Beirut, 1107 2020, Lebanon. sz01@aub.edu.lb.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""BMC Pulm Med""","""['Validation of the Hungarian version of the SRI Questionnaire.', 'The Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) Questionnaire: a specific measure of health-related quality of life in patients receiving home mechanical ventilation.', 'Validation of the Finnish severe respiratory insufficiency questionnaire.', 'Transculturally adapted Spanish SRI questionnaire for home mechanically ventilated patients was viable, valid, and reliable.', 'Validation of the Greek version of the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire.']"""

The Mendelian randomization approach provides the rationale for evaluating the potential causality between genetically-predicted insomnia and lung cancer risk.  Methods:   We extracted 148 insomnia-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary data of individual-level genetic information of participants were obtained from the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) (29,266 cases and 56,450 controls). MR analyses were performed using the inverse-variance-weighted approach, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test, weighted median estimator, and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using Egger intercept analysis, leave-one-out analysis, MR-PRESSO global test, and Cochran's Q test to verify the robustness of our findings.  Results:   The results of the MR analysis indicated an increased risk of lung cancer in insomnia patients (OR = 1.1671; 95% CI 1.0754-1.2666, p = 0.0002). The subgroup analyses showed increased risks of lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.1878; 95% CI 1.0594-1.3317, p = 0.0032) and squamous cell lung cancer (OR = 1.1595; 95% CI 1.0248-1.3119, p = 0.0188).  Conclusion:   Our study indicated that insomnia is a causal risk factor in the development of lung cancer.

Lower- to middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing some of the highest rates of these adverse birth outcomes. Research has suggested that environmental determinants, such as extreme heat, can increase the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Under climate change, extreme heat events have become more severe and frequent and are occurring in differential seasonal patterns. Little is known about how extreme heat affects the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth in LMICs. Thus, it is imperative to examine how exposure to extreme heat affects adverse birth outcomes in regions with some of the highest rates of preterm and stillbirths. Most of the evidence linking extreme heat and adverse birth outcomes has been generated from high-income countries (HICs) notably because measuring temperature in LMICs has proven challenging due to the scarcity of ground monitors. The paucity of health data has been an additional obstacle to study this relationship in LMICs. In this study, globally gridded meteorological data was linked with spatially and temporally resolved Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data on adverse birth outcomes. A global analysis of 14 LMICs was conducted per a pooled time-stratified case-crossover design with distributed-lag nonlinear models to ascertain the relationship between acute exposure to extreme heat and PTB and stillbirths. We notably found that experiencing higher maximum temperatures and smaller diurnal temperature range during the last week before birth increased the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. This study is the first global assessment of extreme heat events and adverse birth outcomes and builds the evidence base for LMICs.""","""['Sara McElroy', 'Sindana Ilango', 'Anna Dimitrova', 'Alexander Gershunov', 'Tarik Benmarhnia']""","""[' University of California, San Diego-Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, United States; San Diego State University, United States; Scripps Institution of Oceanography, United States.

However, the relationship between these domains has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to examine the relationship between sleep problems (including daytime sleepiness), ADHD severity, and functional outcomes (irritability, sluggish cognitive tempo, homework difficulties, and substance use) in a sample of adolescents with ADHD.  Patients/methods:   Eighty-two adolescents (13-17 years) and their families participated in the study. Sleep was measured by both adolescent and parent-report. Adolescent irritability and sluggish cognitive tempo were reported by both adolescents and parents, while other variables were reported by a single reporter (homework difficulties - parent; ADHD severity - parent; substance use - adolescent). Analyses controlled for demographic factors and internalising and externalising comorbidities.  Results:   A weak relationship was found between adolescent-reported sleep problems and daytime sleepiness, which became non-significant in adjusted analyses (β = -0.19, p = 0.115). In adjusted analyses, there was an association between adolescent-reported sleep problems and adolescent-reported irritability (β = -0.27, p = 0.023) as well as between adolescent-reported daytime sleepiness and parent-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (β = 0.28, p = 0.033). In adjusted analyses, parent-reported adolescent sleep problems were associated with ADHD severity (β = 0.54, p = <0.001), parent-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (β = 0.64, p = <0.001), both reporters of irritability (parent-report: β = 0.32, p = 0.004; adolescent-report: β = 0.29, p = 0.022), and homework problems (β = 0.37, p = 0.003). Parent-reported daytime sleepiness was associated with parent-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (β = 0.34, p = 0.024).

Methods:   In the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation, this study assesses the challenges in the conduction of the recently held Kumbh Mela mass gathering (MG), which took place from 14th January 2021 to 29th April 2021 at Haridwar, the capital city of the state of Uttarakhand, India. The correlation between increased cases of COVID-19 and the Kumbh Mela MG has been highlighted through statistical analysis and growth curves using the available data.  Results:   The Kumbh Mela-2021 emerged as a potential super spreader event with an increase of 37 cases per day to 144 cases per day (276%) in the COVID-19 cases in Haridwar. An increase from 138 to 480 cases per day (236%) and from 45 600 to 92 754 cases per day (92%) was noted in Uttarakhand and India respectively during this MG. A very strong correlation of 'more than 0.99' was seen between the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Uttarakhand and Haridwar, and Haridwar and India during the Kumbh Mela in the third wave of the pandemic.  Conclusions:   The direct influence of Kumbh Mela on the increase in the overall number of COVID-19 cases is observed. Although, the socio-cultural, psychological and economical advantages of MGs are considerable in a developing nation like India, but organization of such events can be a huge health hazard. The lack of efficient implementation and observance of COVID-19 guidelines elevates the necessity of cancellation of such MGs to prevent the outbreak of diseases.

Dematiaceous fungi cause phaeohyphomycosis which encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from superficial (cutaneous and subcutaneous) to disseminated infections. Such fungal infections are responsible for causing significant morbidity and mortality, frequently in immunocompromised patients and rarely in immunocompetent patients.  Objectives:   To investigate the prevalence of cutaneous mycosis in Jammu district (India) and to isolate and identify the recovered causal agents from the affected skin of the patients.  Methods:   For direct microscopy, 10% KOH was used. Skin samples were collected carefully from the affected areas of suspected patients, followed by the isolation and identification of the causal agents by cultural examination, morphological examination and ITS sequencing.  Results:   Herein, we report and describe three new cases of cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis from District Jammu of Union Territory Jammu and Kashmir, India. The age of the patients under study ranged from 17 to 42 years and the duration of infection from 1 to 2 years. The etiological agents that were recovered from the patients under study were Alternaria alstromeriae, Epicoccum tritici and Phialemonium obovatum. These dematiaceous fungal species were isolated from the skin specimen of immunocompetent hosts.  Conclusion:   Among the three isolated etiological agents, two (Alternaria alstromeriae, Epicoccum tritici) represent new global records and one (Phialemonium obovatum) new record to India as causal agents of cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis. Careful microscopic and mycological examination form the basis of correct diagnosis of such fungal infections in the absence of simple and reliable laboratory tests (serologic or antigen tests).""","""['Bharti Sharma', 'Skarma Nonzom']""","""[' Department of Botany, University of Jammu, Jammu, India.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Mycoses""","""['Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis (mycotic cyst).', 'Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis in kidney transplant recipients: A series of seven cases.', 'Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis due to Cladophialophora bantiana: a first case report in an immunocompetent patient in Latin America and a brief literature review.', 'Emerging Cutaneous Phaeohyphomycosis Caused by Alternaria infectoria.', 'Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and therapy of infections caused by dematiaceous fungi.']"""

Quality of life is reduced in adolescents with persistent post-concussive symptoms (symptoms >28 days). We replicated a previous randomised controlled trial to validate the safety, efficacy, and generalisability of, and objective adherence to, prescribed early targeted heart rate subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise compared with placebo-like stretching exercise for adolescent recovery from sport-related concussion and for reducing the risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms.  Methods:   This randomised controlled trial was done at three community and hospital-affiliated sports medicine concussion centres in the USA. Male and female adolescent athletes (aged 13-18 years) presenting within 10 days of sport-related concussion were randomly assigned to individualised subsymptom threshold aerobic or stretching exercise at least 20 min daily, for up to 4 weeks after injury. Exercise adherence and intensity were measured by heart rate monitors. The primary outcome was clinical recovery (ie, return to baseline symptoms, normal exercise tolerance, and a normal physical examination) within the 4-week intervention period, and development of persistent post-concussive symptoms beyond 28 days after injury. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02959216.  Findings:   Between Aug 1, 2018, and March 31, 2020, 118 adolescents were recruited (61 were randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise group and 57 to the stretching exercise group) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. On survival analysis, controlling for sex, site, and mean daily exercise time, patients assigned to aerobic exercise were more likely to recover within 4 weeks after injury compared with those assigned to stretching exercise, with a 48% reduced risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms (hazard ratio for stretching vs aerobic exercise of 0·52 [95% CI 0·28-0·97], p=0·039). No adverse events were reported.  Interpretation:   This multicentre study found that early treatment with subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise safely speeds recovery from sport-related concussion and reduces the risk for persistent post-concussive symptoms, an important result given the impact of delayed recovery on adolescent quality of life. Adherence was good and there were no adverse events from this non-pharmacological treatment. These results suggest that physicians should not only permit, but consider prescribing, early subsymptom threshold physical activity to adolescents as treatment for sport-related concussion and to reduce the risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms.

Newspaper representations of dengue as a public health problem in Peru""","""The way newspapers frame infectious disease outbreaks and their connection to the environmental determinants of disease transmission matter because they shape how we understand and respond to these major events. In 2017, following an unexpected climatic event named ""El Niño Costero,"" a dengue epidemic in Peru affected over seventy-five thousand people. This paper examines how the Peruvian news media presented dengue, a climate-sensitive disease, as a public health problem by analyzing a sample of 265 news stories on dengue from two major newspapers published between January 1st and December 31st of 2017. In analyzing the construction of responsibility for the epidemic, I find frames that blamed El Niño Costero's flooding and Peru's poorly prepared cities and public health infrastructure as the causes of the dengue outbreak. However, when analyzing frames that offer solutions to the epidemic, I find that news articles call for government-led, short-term interventions (e.g., fogging) that fail to address the decaying public health infrastructure and lack of climate-resilient health systems. Overall, news media tended to over-emphasize dengue as requiring technical solutions that ignore the root causes of health inequality and environmental injustice that allow dengue to spread in the first place. This case speaks to the medicalization of public health and to a long history of disease-control programs in the Global South that prioritized top-down technical approaches, turning attention away from the social and environmental determinants of health, which are particularly important in an era of climate change.""","""['Maria I Espinoza']""","""[' Department of Sociology, Rutgers University, Davison Hall, 26 Nichol Avenue, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 08901, USA.

Serious fungal infections (SFIs) with comparable morbidity rate in these countries remain neglected.  Objectives:   To estimate the burden of SFI in Togo and to stimulate efforts for improved attention.  Methods:   Literature was thoroughly searched for epidemiological data on SFI in Togo. Incidence and/or prevalence of SFI was estimated using socio-demographics, health system's information, risk-groups data and SFI rates obtained from national and international studies.  Results:   About 5.29% of the 7,265,286 Togolese population is estimated to suffer from SFI annually. Among HIV patients, 1,342, 1,650 and 330 may develop cryptococcal meningitis, Pneumocystis pneumonia and disseminated histoplasmosis respectively per year. Oral and oesophageal candidiasis may annually affect 19,800 and 7,535 persons, respectively, living with HIV. Estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) was 283 cases. Prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) was estimated at 191 cases. The annual incidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) was 4,577 and 6,042 cases, respectively. Tinea capitis and recurrent Candida vaginitis presumably affect 232,271 children and 108,979 women respectively. Candidaemia incidence is estimated at 5 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants and fungal keratitis may affect 981 persons annually.  Conclusions:   SFIs in Togo are probably more significant than expected.

A total of 3347 South Koreans with disabilities from the second wave of the Panel Survey of Employment for the Disabled was utilized. Depressive symptomatology was assessed by whether the participant had experienced depressive symptoms for more than two weeks during the past year. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for depressive symptoms, and a Cox proportional hazards model to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for two-year survival analysis. Persons who acquired mental disability from accident or industrial disaster and persons with congenital physical-internal disability were at higher risk for depressive symptoms. Maintaining employment was found to be an effective way to decrease the risk of depressive symptoms in persons with physical-external disability, sensory/speech disability, or mental disability. In contrast, in physical-internal disability, retaining normal ability to work seemed to be the key to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.

In this study, we estimated smoking- and SLT use-related mortality hazard ratios (HRs) among U.S. adults by sex, age group, and cause of death, for nine mutually exclusive categories of smoking and/or SLT use.  Methods:   We used data from the public-use National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality with mortality follow-up through 2015. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate mortality HRs, adjusted by race/ethnicity, education, poverty level, body mass index, and tobacco-use status.  Results:   With never users as reference group, HRs for smoking-related diseases for male exclusive current smokers aged 35-64 and 65+ were 2.18 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.79-2.65), and 2.45 (95% CI: 2.14-2.79), respectively. Similar significant HR estimates were found for females and for all-cause mortality (ACM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) outcomes. HRs for exclusive current SLT users were only significant for males aged 35-64 for ACM (HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.27-3.27) and OCM (HR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.50-5.25). HRs for users who switched from cigarettes to SLT products were significant for males aged 65+ for smoking-related diseases (HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.47-2.88), SLT-related diseases (HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.36-2.89), and ACM (HR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21-2.19).

Case series:   We describe 4 patients with both chronic migraine and cluster headache, with or without failure to preventive medications. Galcanezumab (240 mg loading dose, followed by 120 mg monthly) was used for at least a 3-month treatment, demonstrating improvement in both migraine and CH outcomes (i.e. migraine days, CH attacks, Headache Impact Test -6 item score, acute medications use), achieving sustained clinical benefit. No adverse events were reported.  Discussion and conclusion:   Taking into account the role of CGRP in migraine and CH pathophysiology, a usually well-tolerated treatment with CGRP blockade could be a rationale-based option to treat patients with coexisting chronic migraine and cluster headache. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of anti-CGRP drugs in episodic and chronic CH treatment, as well as to establish correct timing and patient prerequisites to begin therapy.""","""['Luigi Francesco Iannone', 'Davide Fattori', 'Pierangelo Geppetti', 'Francesco De Cesaris']""","""[' Headache Center and Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla 3, 50139, Florence, Italy.', ' Section of Clinical Pharmacology and Oncology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', ' Headache Center and Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla 3, 50139, Florence, Italy. francesco.decesaris@unifi.it.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Neurol Sci""","""['Galcanezumab: a humanized monoclonal antibody for the prevention of migraine and cluster headache.', 'Galcanezumab for the prevention of cluster headache.', 'Erenumab Efficacy on Comorbid Cluster Headache in Patients With Migraine: A Real-World Case Series.', 'Targeting CGRP for the Prevention of Migraine and Cluster Headache: A Narrative Review.', 'CGRP pathway monoclonal antibodies for cluster headache.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies against Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide for Migraine Prophylaxis: A Systematic Review of Real-World Data.', 'Cranial autonomic symptoms and response to monoclonal antibodies targeting the Calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway: A real-world study.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare the behavioral and cognitive characteristics of poor and good sleepers with and without DD in a community-based sample of preschool children.  Methods:   We recruited 196 children aged 34-77 months from community-based daycare centers, kindergartens, and special education centers. Children were classified as poor sleepers with DD (n = 23), poor sleepers without DD (n = 23), good sleepers with DD (n = 64), and good sleepers without DD (n = 94). Poor sleepers were defined based on Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire Total Sleep Disturbance Score (CSHQ TSDS) cutoff of >52.  Results:   When compared to good sleepers with DD, poor sleepers with DD scored significantly higher on the Attention Problems (p = 0.005) and Aggressive Behaviors (p = 0.001) subscales of the CBCL, indicating greater difficulty. Caregivers of the poor sleepers with DD reported more depressive symptoms (p = 0.028) and more stress related to the child (p = 0.002) and the parent (p = 0.045) than caregivers of the good sleepers with DD. On the other hand, when compared to good sleepers without DD, poor sleepers without DD scored significantly higher only on the Anxious/Depressed subscale (p = 0.045) of the CBCL. Cognitive development and adaptive functioning were not significantly different between poor and good sleepers with and without DD. Among the subscales of the CSHQ, the Sleep Onset Delay showed strongest correlation with behavioral measures of the children and distress of the caregivers.

Further, we applied Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA for whom additional information of in vivo tau biomarker was available.  Methods:   We recruited 110 patients with PPA (41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) who underwent Aβ-PET imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups using general linear models.  Results:   The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), followed by ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%). The A+ PPA subgroup manifested cortical atrophy mainly in the left superior temporal/inferior parietal regions and had lower repetition scores compared to the A-PPA subgroup. Further, we observed that more than 90% (13/14) of the patients with A+ PPA had tau deposition.  Conclusion:   Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and cortical atrophy in patients with PPA based on Aβ deposition.

In this study, we examined the impact of socioeconomic economic status, family stress and maternal depressive symptoms on appetite hormones, adipokines and adiposity. To determine whether adverse home environments in childhood and adolescence relate to adiposity in adolescence and disruptions in appetite hormones and adipokines, specifically lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin and elevated levels of leptin and orexin. Adversity in the home (maternal depressive symptoms, family stress, socioeconomic disadvantage) was measured in the households of 593 Chilean youth at age 10 years (52.3% male) and in 606 youth at 16 years. At 16 years, participants provided fasting blood samples for assessment of adipokines and appetite hormones. Waist-to-height ratio was used to assess central adiposity. Correlational analyses examined associations between continuous levels of adversity in childhood and adolescence and appetite hormones and adiposity in adolescence. Multinomial logistic regressions compared hormone levels by tertiles of adversity. Participants were 52% male, with average age at the 16 years hormone assessment being 16.8 (n = 606, SD = 0.26). Those with highest maternal depression at age 10 had lower adiponectin OR = 0.95 [95% CI: 0.91, 0.99], p = 0.005) and ghrelin levels (OR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.00), p = 0.022) than those in the lowest maternal depression group at age 16. Those with the highest family stress at 16 years had lower adiponectin levels (OR = 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.98), p = 0.004) and higher central adiposity (OR = 1.05 [1.01, 1.08], p = 0.009) than the lowest family stress group. There were no significant associations found between socioeconomic status at either 10 or 16 years and appetite hormones. Results add new evidence regarding the relationship between household adversity to appetite hormones and adipokines, with the most consistent results for adiponectin.

Most previous studies rely on absolute measures of body weight, such as BMI and obesity status, to estimate the social impact of body weight. Using absolute measures of body weight, however, is inconsistent with social-psychological theories that explain the effects of body weight because they conflate the social effects of body weight with biological processes of body weight.  Objective:   This study extends the literature by utilizing a relative measure of body weight, or a student's BMI rank within her relevant peer group, to examine the impact of body weight on youth outcomes.  Methods:   Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and leveraging a quasi-experimental research design, this study examines the association between relative BMI and socioemotional and schooling outcomes among female adolescents in the United States.  Results:   Results show that female students with high relative BMI are more likely to experience a decrease in self-esteem and an increase in depressive symptoms, even after adjusting for absolute BMI and weight perceptions. These effects are partially explained by lower levels of school attachment (∼26% for self-esteem and ∼15% for depressive symptoms). This study also finds that relative BMI is associated with an increased risk of high school dropout, but not college attainment and completed years of schooling. The association between relative BMI and high school dropout is partially explained by a combination of lowered self-esteem (∼7%), increased depressive symptoms (∼12%), as well as a decline in academic achievement (∼33%) and aspirations (∼12%).  Conclusion:   We argue that to better understand how body weight affects one' life outcomes, it is essential to take into consideration the social contexts in which one is embedded.""","""['Jinho Kim', 'Jason M Fletcher']""","""[' Department of Health Policy and Management, Korea University, Republic of Korea; Interdisciplinary Program in Precision Public Health, Korea University, Republic of Korea; Center for Demography of Health and Aging, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.

In addition, a multiplexing method was established by adding index sequences through the PCR with a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline. This enables defining cut-off values for observed read counts. In the laboratory setting, this approach allowed the detection of up to nine different flaviviruses.

Results:   The majority of strains harbored Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and stx1d, stx2 and stx2e, and ehxA genes, while a minority harbored stx2c subtype and eaeA. We identified 10 stx gene combinations; most of strains 31/60 (51.7%) exhibited four copies of stx genes, namely the stx1, stx1d, stx2, and stx2e, and the strains exhibited a high range of multiple antimicrobial resistance indices. The resistance genes blaCTX-M-1 and blaTEM were detected. For the oxytetracycline resistance genes, most of strains contained tetA, tetB, tetE, and tetG while the tetC was present at low frequency.

Less is known about the effect of lifelong adversity on the aging process over time. This study aimed to investigate the impact of cumulative adversity on the accelerated deterioration in health over time - mobility limitation and self-rated state of health in old age.  Methods:   This study provides a 14-year, 6-time-point follow-up on a representative sample of Europeans using the SHARE Project - longitudinal survey panel. The sample included a total of 7195 respondents aged 65 and older from nine countries in Europe. The outcome measurements were the number of mobility limitations and self-rated health - trajectories along 6 measurements. The independent variable was Lifetime Cumulative Adversity, and the analyses included also control variables - age, gender, socioeconomic status, depression, and country.  Results:   Time-based Latent Growth Curve Modeling has demonstrated that the effects of Lifetime Cumulative Adversity were significant on both health measures, by means of the intercepts and the slopes: Greater experience of adversities correlated with a higher physical health impairment at baseline and a higher decline along time. The effects of self-rated health were weaker than the effects of mobility limitations.  Conclusions:   Given that the populations of numerous countries are rapidly aging, understanding the risk factors associated with health deterioration is important, especially for policymakers and medical health care experts, to raise awareness of the relationship between lifelong adversity and health decline and to build preventive interventions to deal with these consequences.""","""['Michal Levinsky', 'Miriam Schiff']""","""[' Paul Baerwald School of Social Work, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, 91905, Jerusalem, Israel.

However, the associations between these constructs and their influence on such behaviors are yet to be examined. This study aimed to determine the relationships among three cognitive constructs, namely, delay discounting, time perspective, and self-schemas, and determine the associations of these constructs with alcohol drinking (alcohol use and alcohol problems) and disordered eating behaviors in adolescents. Participants were 436 eighth-graders from three public junior high schools in southern Taiwan, who answered an anonymous questionnaire assessing self-schema, delay discounting, time perspective, and health risk behaviors. Generalized linear models with robust estimation were performed to estimate the effects; gender was the covariate. Delay discounting was associated with alcohol use (OR = 1.15), but not alcohol problems and disordered eating behaviors. Present-Hedonistic time perspective was associated with alcohol use (OR = 2.01), alcohol problems (IRR = 2.23), and disordered eating behaviors (Exp(b) = 1.38); while Future time perspective was associated with alcohol problems (IRR = 2.18). Drinker self-schema was associated with alcohol use (OR = 1.62) and alcohol problems (IRR = 1.71). Fat/overweight self-schema was associated with overall disordered eating (Exp(b) = 1.03). Thus, the findings suggest that each of the three constructs is independently associated with drinking and disordered eating behaviors, and these associations vary according to the specific type of behavior.

Increasing evidence suggests FGCS improves quality-of-life outcomes, but literature evaluating FGCS patient demographics, surgical risk factors, procedures, and complications is limited. Therefore, the authors conducted a study of a national surgical database from 2005 to 2019 attempting to fill in these literature gaps. Statistics were used to assess temporal trends after 2014. A total of 203 FGCS cases were identified, with the earliest occurring in 2013. Case volume increased annually from 2015-2019. The average patient age was 34.0 years and racial demographics largely mirrored national estimates for the transgender/non-binary population. Obesity (20.7%) and hypertension (3.9%) were the only patient co-morbidities, although a relatively high proportion were underweight (5.4%). The majority of cases were outpatient procedures (66.5%) conducted by either plastic surgery (38.9%) or otolaryngology (61.1%). Comparing FGCSs by anatomic site, the proportion of tracheal procedures decreased between 2015-17 and 2018-19 (25.6% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.0002) whereas the proportion of brow/forehead reconstructions increased (32.6% versus 63.1%, P = 0.0005). These changes coincided with an increase in mean operative time (168.6 minutes versus 260.0, P = 0.0002). Complications were rare (3.9%), and the most common was surgical site infection (3.4%), a previously unreported outcome in the FGCS literature. Overall, FGCS patients are mostly young healthy individuals from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, and they have few surgical complications. The increasing volume and complexity of FGCSs may be a result of expanding insurance coverage for previously unaffordable procedures.""","""['Alexander I Murphy', 'Paul A Asadourian', 'Andrew A Marano', 'Christine H Rohde']""","""[' Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""J Craniofac Surg""","""['The Role of Facial Gender Confirmation Surgery in the Treatment of Gender Dysphoria.', 'Techniques and Trends of Facial Feminization Surgery: A Systematic Review and Representative Case Report.', 'An update in facial gender confirming surgery.', 'Temporal Trends in Gender-Affirming Surgery Among Transgender Patients in the United States.', 'National Variation of Insurance Coverage for Gender-Affirming Facial Feminization Surgery.', 'Medical considerations in the care of transgender and gender diverse patients with eating disorders.']"""

Importantly, previous research indicated a substantially stronger impact of categorically rather than dimensionally assessed mental health problems on birth outcomes and child development.  Methods:   The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess depressive symptoms and stress during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy dimensionally and categorically, with scores ≥10 indicating clinical significance. Gestational age at birth and BMI-SDS from birth up to 2 years of age were examined as dependent variables. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the prediction of birth outcomes and child anthropometry by mental health problems while controlling for multiple maternal and child characteristics in 322 mother-child dyads.  Results:   Dimensionally assessed mental health problems did not significantly predict birth outcomes. While categorical depressive symptoms significantly predicted a higher child BMI-SDS, categorical stress significantly predicted a lower gestational age at birth. Neither categorical nor dimensional mental health problems significantly predicted child BMI-SDS at 6, 12, and 24 months postpartum.

To gain insight into the psychological response and coping ability of this very large, globally distributed population, we collected data from older Muslim Palestinian people diagnosed with cancer concerning depression hope and perceived social support. Both hope and social support were selected because they can be manipulated through intervention and education, as shown in the geriatric literature. Data were compared to data collected from older Jewish Israeli people diagnosed with cancer.  Design:   The study sample comprised 143 Muslim Palestinian and 110 Jewish Israeli people diagnosed with cancer, aged ≥ 65. All participants were either in treatment for active disease or within 6 months of such treatment. Self-administered measures included depression (the Five-Item Geriatric Depression Scale), perceived social support (Cancer Perceived Agents of Social Support Questionnaire) and hope (Snyder's Adult Hope Scale).  Results:   Hope and depression were both found to be significantly higher among the Muslim Palestinian patients than in the Jewish Israeli participants. In both samples, higher levels of hope were associated with lower levels of depression, with this correlation stronger in the Jewish Israeli group.  Conclusion:   To improve the psychological wellbeing of patients, healthcare providers must exercise cultural sensitivity in their interactions, respecting the perspectives of both the patients and their families.

The birth plan was developed as a tool to facilitate communication between health professionals and women in Spain, but their value in routine practice has been questioned. Besides, little is known about women's experiences of participation in decision-making in the Spanish context. Thus, this study aimed to explore women's experiences of participation in shared decision-making during hospital childbirth.  Methods:   An exploratory qualitative study using focus groups was carried out in one maternity unit of a large reference hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Participants were first-time mothers aged 18 years or older who had had a live birth at the same hospital in the previous 12 months. Data collected were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a six-phase inductive thematic analysis process.  Results:   Twenty-three women participated in three focus groups. Three major themes emerged from the data: ""Women's low participation in shared decision-making"", ""Lack of information provision for shared decision-making"", and ""Suggestions to improve women's participation in shared decision-making"". The women who were willing to take an active role in decision-making encountered barriers to achieving this and some women did not feel prepared to do so. The birth plan was experienced as a deficient method to promote women's participation, as health professionals did not use them. Participants described the information given as insufficient and not offered at a timely or useful point where it could aid their decision-making. Potential improvements identified that could promote women's participation were having a mutually respectful relationship with their providers, the support of partners and other members of the family and receiving continuity of a coordinated and personalised perinatal care.  Conclusion:   Enhancing women's involvement in shared decision-making requires the acquisition of skills by health professionals and women. The development and implementation of interventions that encompass a training programme for health professionals and women, accompanied by an effective tool to promote women's participation in shared decision-making during childbirth, is highly recommended.""","""['María López-Toribio', 'Paulina Bravo', 'Anna Llupià']""","""[' Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.', ' Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ' School of Nursing, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. pbbravo@uc.cl.', ' Centro Núcleo Milenio Autoridad y Asimetrías de Poder / Millennium Nucleus Center Authority and Power Asymmetries, Santiago, Chile. pbbravo@uc.cl.', ' Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Barcelona, Spain.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""BMC Pregnancy Childbirth""","""[""Reproducing normative femininity: Women's evaluations of their birth experiences analysed by means of word frequency and thematic analysis."", ""How do informal information sources influence women's decision-making for birth?

Methods:   We conducted a multi-center bacterial resistance monitoring project from 2015 to 2017.The minimum inhibitory concentrations ofCREco were determined bybroth microdilution method. The genome sequencing of CREcoisolates was performed, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was analyzed.  Results:   A total of 144CREcoisolatescollected from 10 cities in China were involved in this study. ST167 (n = 43) is the most popular type, followed by ST410(n = 14), ST131(n = 9). There were 102 (70.83%) CREco isolates that produced various NDMs, including NDM-1 (n = 16), NDM-4(n = 1), NDM-5(n = 79), NDM-6(n = 2) and NDM-9(n = 4). In addition, 15 isolates produced KPC-2, three isolates wereIMP-4 positive, and three isolates produced OXA-48. Genetic relatedness and phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates with the same ST had a high degree of homology. Some STs (including ST167, ST410, ST131, ST46, ST405 and ST617) exhibited a trend of outbreak.  Conclusions:   The majority of CREco belonged to ST167, followed by ST410 and ST131, and most of them carried various NDM-coding genes.

The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) [39] was developed from a community-based sample of children and has validated a cut-off score of 41. Katz et al. [50] developed an abbreviated 23-item four-factor version of the CSHQ, which may be useful when assessing sleep in autistic children. However, a cut-off value has not yet been developed.  Objective:   Our objective was to develop and validate a cut-off for the CSHQ-autism total score in order to identify sleep problems among autistic children. We hypothesized that the derived cut-off value for the CSHQ-autism would perform better than the original CSHQ cut at 41 on validation in a sample of autistic children.  Methods:   Age-specific cut-off values were developed and validated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.  Results:   The derived cut-off values for the CSHQ-autism total score were 34, 35, 33, and 35 for the 2-3, 4-10, 11-17, and 2-17 years age groups, respectively. On validation, all cut-off values performed with moderate to high sensitivity (76.6-82.4%) and moderate specificity (69.1-75.5%), while the original CSHQ cut at 41 had high sensitivity (89.9-93.0%) but low specificity (42.6-57.7%). Using McNemar's tests, the CSHQ-autism had significantly higher specificity but lower sensitivity than the original CSHQ cut at 41 in all age groups.  Conclusions:   The CSHQ-autism cut-off values performed better overall than the original CSHQ cut at 41 in a sample of autistic children.

In this sense, this contribution evaluates the incidence of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, AD, and dementia from unspecified cause, DU) occurring in Europe associated with the exposure to air pollution (essentially NO2 and PM2.5) for the present climatic period (1991-2010) and for a future climate change scenario (RCP8.5, 2031-2050). The GEMM methodology has been applied to air pollution simulations using the chemistry/climate regional model WRF-Chem. Present population data were obtained from NASA's Center for Socioeconomic Data and Applications (SEDAC); while future population projections for the year 2050 were derived from the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Population Dynamics. Overall, the estimated incidence rate (cases per year) of AD and DU associated with exposure to air pollution over Europe is 498,000 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 348,600-647,400] and 314,000 (95% CI 257,500-401,900), respectively. An important increase in the future incidence rate is projected (around 72% for both types of dementia) when considering the effect of climate change together with the foreseen changes in the future population, because of the expected aging of European population. The climate penalty (impacts of future climate change alone on air quality) has a limited effect on the total changes of dementia (approx. 0.5%), because the large increase in the incidence rate over southern Europe is offset by its decrease over more northern countries, favored by an improvement of air pollution caused by the projected enhancement of rainfall.""","""['Patricia Guzmán', 'Patricia Tarín-Carrasco', 'María Morales-Suárez-Varela', 'Pedro Jiménez-Guerrero']""","""[' Department of Physics, Regional Campus of International Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, University of Murcia, Spain.', ' Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain; CIBER Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', ' Department of Physics, Regional Campus of International Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, University of Murcia, Spain; Biomedical Research Institute of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.

Methods:   Data on lung cancer attributable to ambient PM2.5 were downloaded from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The numbers and age-standardized rates on lung cancer mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) were estimated by age, sex, region, and country. We used estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) to quantify the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019.  Results:   In 2019, the number of global lung cancer deaths and DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5 was approximately 0.31 million and 7.02 million respectively, among which more deaths and DALYs occurred in males. At GBD region level, the heaviest burden occurred in East Asia, accounting for over 50% worldwide, with China ranked first worldwide. The number of ambient PM2.5 attributable lung cancer deaths and DALYs has over doubled from 1990 to 2019, but high sociodemographic index (SDI) region had a rapid decrease, with EAPC -2.21 in ASMR (95% CI: -2.32, -2.09). The age-specific mortality rate or DALY rate has increased in all age groups in low to middle SDI regions from 1990 to 2019. The ASMR or ASDR showed an inverted V-shaped association with SDI.

Diverse genotypes have been demonstrated to drive the epidemiology of drug resistant (DR-) TB globally. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the genotypes and transmission dynamics of M. tuberculosis in Zambia. This study aimed to describe the genotypes of DR-TB from the Copperbelt and Northern regions of Zambia. Molecular typing tools of insertion sequence 6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110-RFLP) and spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) were applied. We demonstrate that diverse genotypes are associated with DR-TB in Zambia. The predominant genotype was lineage 4; other strains belonged to lineage 2 and 3. Genotypes previously identified as driving the epidemiology of drug susceptible TB have been identified as drivers of DR-TB. Genotyping analysis showed clustering of strains among patients from different regions of the country; suggesting that DR-TB is widespread. Molecular findings combined with phenotypic and epidemiologic findings play a critical role in identifying circulating genotypes and possible transmission chains. Clustering of drug resistant strains was demonstrated to be 48% and 86% according to IS6110-RFLP and spoligotyping, respectively.

Maintained in nature by Ixodes spp. ticks, POWV has also been isolated from species of other hard tick genera, yet it is unclear if these species can serve as vectors. Dermacentor variabilis and Amblyomma americanum share geographic and ecologic overlap with Ixodes spp. ticks and POWV transmission foci, raising the possibility that POWV could become established in these tick species and leading to range expansion and increased human risk. Therefore, we assessed the competency of Ixodes scapularis, D. variabilis and A. americanum for POWV lineage II (POWV II).  Methods:   Larvae from all three species were co-infested on POWV-infected Balb/c mice. The engorged larvae were allowed to molt to nymphs and screened for the presence of POWV II RNA by reverse transcription-qPCR. Eight infected nymphs from each species were allowed to individually feed on a naïve mouse. Mice were screened for the presence of POWV II RNA to determine infection status.  Results:   The results demonstrated that larvae from all three tick species were able to efficiently acquire POWV II via feeding on viremic mice, maintain infection through molting and successively transmit POWV to naïve mice at the nymphal stage at comparable rates across all three species.  Conclusions:   Our findings reveal that non-Ixodes tick species can serve as competent vectors for POWV and highlight the potential role of these species in the ecology and epidemiology of POWV.

Targeted proteomics may facilitate the understanding of mechanisms linking diet to chronic diseases. Methods and Results We examined 6360 participants (mean age 50 years; 54% women) in the Framingham Heart Study. The associations between diet and 71 cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related proteins were examined using 3 diet quality scores: the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, the modified Mediterranean-style Diet Score, and the modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet score. A mediation analysis was conducted to examine which proteins mediated the associations of diet with incident CVD and all-cause mortality. Thirty of the 71 proteins were associated with at least 1 diet quality score (P<0.0007) after adjustment for multiple covariates in all study participants and confirmed by an internal validation analysis. Gene ontology analysis identified inflammation-related pathways such as regulation of cell killing and neuroinflammatory response (Bonferroni corrected P<0.05). During a median follow-up of 13 years, we documented 512 deaths and 488 incident CVD events. Higher diet quality scores were associated with lower risk of CVD (P≤0.03) and mortality (P≤0.004). After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, 4 proteins (B2M [beta-2-microglobulin], GDF15 [growth differentiation factor 15], sICAM1 [soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1], and UCMGP [uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein]) mediated the association between at least 1 diet quality score and all-cause mortality (median proportion of mediation ranged from 8.6% to 25.9%). We also observed that GDF15 mediated the association of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index with CVD (median proportion of mediation: 8.6%). Conclusions Diet quality is associated with new-onset CVD and mortality and with circulating CVD-related proteins.

In addition, 385 patients (16.2%; 14.8-17.3%) out of those survivors had disability events. The patients had DNT times of longer than 45 min, compared with those treated within 45 min, did not have significantly higher 1-year disability rate (18.9% vs 16.7% [absolute difference, 1.9% {95% CI, 1.1% to 3.0%}, odd ratio {OR}, 1.22 {95% CI, 0.89 to 1.43}]).

The primary efficacy outcome of THALES included hemorrhagic stroke and death, events also counted in the primary safety outcome. We sought to disentangle risk and benefit, assess their relative impact, and attempt to identify subgroups with disproportionate risk or benefit.  Methods:   In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of patients with mild-to-moderate acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, patients were randomized within 24 hours after symptom onset to a 30-day regimen of either ticagrelor plus aspirin or matching placebo plus aspirin. For the present analyses, we defined the efficacy outcome, major ischemic events, as the composite of ischemic stroke or nonhemorrhagic death, and defined the safety outcome, major hemorrhage, as intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic death. Net clinical impact was defined as the combination of these 2 end points.  Results:   In 11 016 patients (5523 ticagrelor-aspirin and 5493 aspirin), a major ischemic event occurred in 294 patients (5.3%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and in 359 patients (6.5%) in the aspirin group (absolute risk reduction 1.19% [95% CI, 0.31%–2.07%]). Major hemorrhage occurred in 22 patients (0.4%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 6 patients (0.1%) in the aspirin group (absolute risk increase 0.29% [95% CI, 0.10%–0.48%]). Net clinical impact favored ticagrelor-aspirin (absolute risk reduction 0.97% [95% CI, 0.08%–1.87%]). Findings were similar when different thresholds for disability were applied and over a range of predefined subgroups.  Conclusions:   In patients with mild-moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, ischemic benefits of 30-day treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin outweigh risks of hemorrhage.

How can we do better?""","""Background: Infectious diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As of 2018, the total world population of children < 5 years of age was roughly estimated at 679 million. Of these children, an estimated 5.3 million died of all causes in 2018, with an estimated 700,000 who died of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases; 99% of the children who died had lived in low- and middle-income countries. The infectious diseases that remain major causes of mortality for which vaccines have been shown to provide proven preventive success include, in order of prevalence, are those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rotavirus, Bordetella pertussis, measles virus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and influenza virus. Objective: The purpose of the present report was to address the global burden of these six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children < 5 years of age, together with implications for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in children. Methods: The current immunization strategies for the prevention of the six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children are reviewed as a framework for new strategies of vaccine prevention of COVID-19 in children. Results: The burden of addressing vaccine prevention of future infectious disease in children can be effectively pursued through knowledge gained from past experiences with vaccine usage in these six vaccine-preventable childhood infectious diseases. Conclusion: Issues with regard to the burden of disease mortality, disease transmission, and available vaccines as well as vaccine successes and shortcomings for specific pathogens can serve as important landmarks for effective use of future vaccines. Although much success has been made globally in preventing these childhood deaths, much remains to be done.""","""['Lawrence D Frenkel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Allergy Asthma Proc""","""['Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2021-2022).', 'Routine childhood immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: a benefit-risk analysis of health benefits versus excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children younger than 5 years: global estimates.', 'Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2020-2021).', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Generating enhanced mucosal immunity against Bordetella pertussis: current challenges and new directions.', 'The complexities of allergic diseases continue to challenge the allergist-immunologist.', 'Trends of Incidence, Mortality, and Risk Factors for Lower Respiratory Infections among Children under 5 Years in China from 2000 to 2019.', 'Model-based estimation of burden of COVID-19 with disability-adjusted life years and value of statistical life in West Bengal, India.', 'Changes in the prevalence of infectious diseases before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan.']"""

Methods:   A total of 20,737 patients with hypertension and three BMI measurements between 2006 and 2011 were included. Average real variability (ARV) was used to evaluate variability, and the subjects were divided into three groups: tertile 1 with BMI_ARV ≤0.86; tertile 2 with 0.86 < BMI_ARV ≤ 1.60; and tertile 3 with BMI_ARV >1.60.

The Gore REDUCE trial prospectively performed baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) for all subjects providing an objective measure of the effectiveness of closure.  Methods:   We performed blinded evaluations of the presence, location, and volume of new infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging of recurrent clinical stroke or new infarct (>3 mm) on T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery from baseline to follow-up MRI at 2 years, comparing closure to medical therapy alone. We also examined the effect of shunt size and the development of atrial fibrillation on infarct burden at follow-up.  Results:   At follow-up, new clinical stroke or silent MRI infarct occurred in 18/383 (4.7%) patients who underwent closure and 19/177 (10.7%) medication-only patients (relative risk, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24–0.81], P=0.02). Clinical strokes were less common in closure patients compared with medically treated patients, 5 (1.3%) versus 12 (6.8%), P=0.001, while silent MRI infarcts were similar, 13 (3.4%) versus 7 (4.0%), P=0.81. There were no differences in number, volumes, and distribution of new infarct comparing closure patients to those treated with medication alone. There were also no differences of number, volumes, and distribution comparing silent infarcts to clinical strokes. Infarct burden was also similar for patients who developed atrial fibrillation and for those with large shunts.  Conclusions:   The REDUCE trial demonstrates that patent foramen ovale closure prevents recurrent brain infarction based on the objective outcome of new infarcts on MRI. Only clinical strokes were reduced by closure while silent infarctions were similar between study arms, and there were no differences in infarct volume or location comparing silent infarcts to clinical strokes.

ADHD is highly prevalent in patients with AUD, but it is unknown whether the presence of comorbid AUD might change the nature of the association between ADHD, BE, FA and BMI (food and alcohol may either compete for the same brain neurocircuitry or share vulnerability risk factors). Here, we filled this gap by testing the association between ADHD and FA/BE in adult patients hospitalized for AUD, with the strength of simultaneously assessing childhood and adult ADHD. We also investigated the association between ADHD and BMI, and the other factors associated with BMI (FA/BE, AUD severity).  Methods:   We included 149 AUD inpatients between November 2018 and April 2019. We assessed both childhood and adulthood ADHD (Wender Utah Render Scale and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), FA (modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0), BE (Binge Eating Scale), and BMI and AUD (clinical assessment).  Results:   In multivariable analyses adjusted for age, adult ADHD was associated with higher BE scores (p = .048), but not significant BE (9% vs. 7%; p = .70). ADHD was also associated with FA diagnosis and the number or FA symptoms, with larger effect size for adult (ORs: 9.45[95%CI: 2.82-31.74] and 1.38[1.13-1.69], respectively) than childhood ADHD (ORs: 4.45[1.37-14.46] and 1.40[1.13-1.75], respectively). In multivariable analysis, BMI was associated with both significant BE (p < .001) and FA diagnosis (p = .014), but not adult ADHD nor AUD severity.  Conclusion:   In patients hospitalized for AUD, self-reported adult ADHD was associated with FA and BE, but not BMI. Our results set the groundwork for longitudinal research on the link between ADHD, FA, BE, and BMI in AUD inpatients.""","""['Hussein El Ayoubi', 'Servane Barrault', 'Adrien Gateau', 'Samuele Cortese', 'Julie Frammery', 'Elodie Mollat', 'Fréderique Bonnet-Brilhault', 'Marie Grall-Bronnec', 'Nicolas Ballon', 'Paul Brunault']""","""["" CHRU de Tours, Service d'Addictologie Universitaire, Équipe de Liaison et de Soins en Addictologie, Tours, France; Centre Hospitalier Louis Sevestre, La Futaie, La Membrolle sur Choisille, France; CHRU de Tours, Service d'Addictologie Universitaire, Centre de Soins d'Accompagnement et de Prévention en Addictologie d'Indre-et-Loire (CSAPA-37), Tours, France.

The key pathways of AMD are suggested to be excessive oxidative stress and inflammation in the central retina. Because air pollution has been found capable of inducing oxidative stress and inflammation, it may play a role in development of AMD. This study investigated the association between ambient air pollution and AMD in 15,115 middle-aged and older adults (≥40 years) from Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2012. After controlling for important confounders, ambient NO2 and CO in current-to-5 prior years and PM10 in 2-to-5 prior years were significantly associated with higher prevalence of early AMD, while O3 in current-to-5 prior years was significantly associated with lower prevalence of early AMD. When modeled air pollution within administrative division units, its ORs with an IQR increase in NO2, CO, and O3 at current year were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.05-1.46), 1.22 (95% CI: 1.09-1.38), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.92), respectively. Overall, results from air pollution at local/town units were consistent with those at administrative division units.

Study design:   Between January and April 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative network of pediatricians. Descriptive statistics were generated for all items. The χ2 test, t tests, and Poisson regression were used to compare physician and practice characteristics between respondents who would rarely or never versus sometimes or often/always test for mumps in a vaccinated 17-year-old with parotitis in a non-outbreak setting.  Results:   The response rate was 67% (297 of 444). For knowledge, more than one-half of the pediatricians responded incorrectly or ""don't know"" for 6 of the 9 true/false statements about mumps epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention, and more than one-half reported needing additional guidance on mumps buccal swab testing. For testing practices, 59% of respondents reported they would sometimes (35%) or often/always (24%) test for mumps in a vaccinated 17-year-old with parotitis in a non-outbreak setting; older physicians, rural physicians, and physicians from the Northeast or Midwest were more likely to test for mumps. Thirty-six percent of the pediatricians reported they would often/always report a patient with suspected mumps to public health authorities.  Conclusions:   Pediatricians report mumps knowledge gaps and practices that do not align with public health recommendations. These gaps may lead to underdiagnosis and underreporting of mumps cases, delaying public health response measures and contributing to ongoing disease transmission.""","""['Jessica R Cataldi', ""Sean T O'Leary"", 'Mariel A Marlow', 'Brenda L Beaty', 'Laura P Hurley', 'Lori A Crane', 'Michaela Brtnikova', 'Carol Gorman', 'Huong T Pham', 'Megan C Lindley', 'Allison Kempe']""","""["" Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.

Barbecuing results in high outdoor air pollution exposures, but the health effects are unknown.  Objective:   The objective was to investigate short-term changes in respiratory health in healthy adults, associated with exposure to barbecue fumes.  Methods:   16 healthy, adult volunteers were exposed to barbecue smoke in outdoor air in rest during 1.5 h, using a repeated-measures design. Major air pollutants were monitored on-site, including particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5), particle number concentrations (PNC) and black- and brown carbon. At the same place and time-of-day, subjects participated in a control session, during which they were not exposed to barbecue smoke. Before and immediately after all sessions lung function was measured. Before, immediately after, 4- and 18 h post-sessions nasal expression levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) were determined in nasal swabs, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Associations between major air pollutants, lung function and inflammatory markers were assessed using mixed linear regression models.  Results:   High PM2.5 levels and PNCs were observed during barbecue sessions, with averages ranging from 553 to 1062 μg/m3 and 109,000-463,000 pt/cm3, respectively. Average black- and brown carbon levels ranged between 4.1-13.0 and 5.0-16.2 μg/m3. A 1000 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with 2.37 (0.97, 4.67) and 2.21 (0.98, 5.00) times higher expression of IL8, immediately- and 18 h after exposure. No associations were found between air pollutants and lung function, or the expression of IL6 or TNFα.  Discussion:   Short-term exposure to air pollutants emitted from barbecuing was associated with a mild respiratory response in healthy young adults, including prolonged increase in nasal IL8 without a change in lung function and other measured inflammatory markers. The results might indicate prolonged respiratory inflammation, due to short-term exposure to barbecue fumes.""","""['Esther S Lenssen', 'Raymond H H Pieters', 'Sandra M Nijmeijer', 'Marieke Oldenwening', 'Kees Meliefste', 'Gerard Hoek']""","""[' Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P) is a common environmental and foodborne pollutant found in smoke and fire-grilled foods, which can have an adverse effect on human health. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The epidemiological studies suggest that both environmental risk factors and chronic liver injury including NAFL are important for HCC development, but the precise mechanisms linking eating habits to hepato-carcinogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that various miRNAs in B[a]P-exposed tumor cells contribute to tumor metastasis, among which miR-650 could be the most potent inducer. Furthermore, we found that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is directly regulated by miR-650 and its suppression regulates the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) cascade. Our findings reveal a possible adverse outcome pathway of SOCS3/JAK/STAT3 regulation in B[a]P-induced HCC progress.

This study aimed to estimate the frequency of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium in some domestic birds based on molecular diagnosis, antibiogram profile, and PCR-based detection of inhA, rpoB, rpsL, and otrB antibiotic resistance-related genes.  Methods:   A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from small flocks of house-reared domestic birds at Ismailia Governorate, Egypt. The collected samples were processed and subjected to the bacteriological examination. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the recovered isolates was performed using the broth microdilution method for the detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The genetic detection of the IS901confirmatory gene, inhA, rpoB, rpsL, and otrB genes was carried out using PCR.  Results:   The frequency of M. avium subsp. avium was 4.1% (5/120); 10% (4/40) in ducks, and 2.5% (1/10) in geese. The identification of the recovered isolates was confirmed using PCR, where all the tested isolates were positive for IS901confirmatory gene. The results of the broth microdilution method revealed that most of the recovered isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline, and harbored the inhA, rpoB, rpsL, and otrB genes.  Conclusion:   In brief, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report that emphasized the emergence of avian tuberculosis in house-reared domestic birds in Egypt. The emergence of MDR- M. avium subsp. avium is considered a public health threat. Emerging MDR-M. avium subsp. avium in domestic birds are commonly harbored the IS901, inhA, rpoB, rpsL, and otrB genes.

HWs are modelled considering three factors: number per annum, duration and intensity, characterised by three stochastic processes: Poisson, Gamma and truncated Gaussian, respectively. Potential correlations between these processes are also considered. The probabilistic temperature behaviour is combined with an epidemiological model with stochastic mortality risk following a generalized extreme value distribution (gev). The objective of this study is to obtain probability distributions of mortality and risk measures such as the mean value of the 5% of worst cases in the 21st century, in particular from 2025 to 2100. Estimates from stochastic models for characterising HWs and epidemiological impacts on human health can vary from one climate model to another, so relying on a single climate model can be problematic. For this reason, the calculations are carried out for 21 models and the average of the results is obtained. A sensitivity adaptation analysis is also performed. Under RCP 8.5 for 2100 for Madrid city a mean excess of 3.6 °C over the 38 °C temperature threshold is expected as the average of all models, with an expected attributable mortality of 1614 people, but these figures may be substantially exceeded in some cases if the highest-risk cases occur.""","""['Luis M Abadie', 'Josué M Polanco-Martínez']""","""[' Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Sede Building 1, 1st Floor, Scientific Campus, Leioa, 48940, Spain.', ' Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Sede Building 1, 1st Floor, Scientific Campus, Leioa, 48940, Spain; Unit of Excellence, Economic Management for Sustainability (GECOS), IME, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, 37007, Spain.

We aimed to explore the associations of ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) with MDs hospitalizations in 17 Chinese cities during 2015-2018, and estimate the attributable risk and economic costs of MDs hospitalizations associated with gaseous pollutants. City-specific relationships between gaseous pollutants and MDs hospitalizations were evaluated using over-dispersed generalized additive models, then combined to obtain the pooled effect. Concentration-response (C-R) curves of gaseous pollutants with MDs from each city were pooled to allow regional estimates to be derived. The morbidity and economic burdens of MDs hospitalizations attributable to gaseous pollutants were further assessed. A total of 171,939 MDs hospitalizations were included. We observed insignificant association of O3 with MDs. An interquartile range increase in SO2 at lag0 (9.1 μg/m³), NO2 at lag0 (16.7 μg/m³) and CO at lag2 (0.4 mg/m³) corresponded to a 3.02% (95%CI: 0.72%, 5.38%), 5.03% (95%CI: 1.84%, 8.32%) and 2.18% (95%CI: 0.40%, 4.00%) increase in daily MDs hospitalizations, respectively. These effects were modified by sex, season and cause-specific MDs. The C-R curves of SO2 and NO2 with MDs indicated nonlinearity and the slops were steeper at lower concentrations. Overall, using current standards as reference concentrations, 0.27% (95%CI: 0.07%, 0.48%) and 0.06% (95%CI: 0.02%, 0.10%) of MDs hospitalizations could be attributable to extra SO2 and NO2 exposures, and the corresponding economic costs accounted for 0.34% (95%CI: 0.08%, 0.60%) and 0.07% (95%CI: 0.03%, 0.11%) of hospitalization expenses, respectively.

Hundreds of genomic loci impacting quantitative facial features have been identified. While these associations have been shown to influence morphology by altering the mean size and shape of facial measures, their effect on trait variance remains unclear. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis for the variance of 20 quantitative facial measurements in 2,447 European individuals and identified several suggestive variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). These vQTLs guided us to conduct an efficient search for gene-by-gene (G × G) interactions, which uncovered an interaction between PRICKLE1 and FOCAD affecting cranial base width. We replicated this G × G interaction signal at the locus level in an additional 5,128 Korean individuals. We used the hypomorphic Prickle1 Beetlejuice (Prickle1 Bj ) mouse line to directly test the function of Prickle1 on the cranial base and observed wider cranial bases in Prickle1 Bj/Bj . Importantly, we observed that the Prickle1 and Focadhesin proteins co-localize in murine cranial base chondrocytes, and this co-localization is abnormal in the Prickle1 Bj/Bj mutants. Taken together, our findings uncovered a novel G × G interaction effect in humans with strong support from both epidemiological and molecular studies.

A relevant proportion of subjects achieving durable disease control may be considered potentially 'cured', as opposed to patients experiencing primary ICI refractoriness or short-term clinical benefit. We developed and externally validated a nomogram to estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and the time-independent event-free probability (EFP) in patients with MSI-high mCRC receiving ICIs.  Methods:   The PFS and EFP were estimated using a cure model fitted on a developing set of 163 patients and validated on a set of 146 patients with MSI-high mCRC receiving anti-programmed death (ligand)1 (PD-(L)1) ± anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) agents. A total of 23 putative prognostic factors were chosen and then selected using a random survival forest (RSF). The model performance in estimating PFS probability was evaluated by assessing calibration (internally-developing set and externally-validating set) and quantifying the discriminative ability (Harrell C index).  Results:   RFS selected five variables: ICI type (anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy vs anti-CTLA-4 combo), ECOG PS (0 vs >0), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (≤3 vs >3), platelet count, and prior treatment lines. As both in the developing and validation series most PFS events occurred within 12 months, this was chosen as cut-point for PFS prediction. The combination of the selected variables allowed estimation of the 12-month PFS (focused on patients with low chance of being cured) and the EFP (focused on patients likely to be event-free at a certain point of their follow-up). ICI type was significantly associated with disease control, as patients receiving the anti-CTLA-4-combination experienced the best outcomes. The calibration of PFS predictions was good both in the developing and validating sets. The median value of the EFP (46%) allowed segregation of two prognostic groups in both the developing (PFS HR=3.73, 95% CI 2.25 to 6.18; p<0.0001) and validating (PFS HR=1.86, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.23; p=0.0269) sets.

According to the ""one health"" approach, this study investigated animal reservoirs of ST131, their relationships with human strains, and the genetic features associated with host colonization. High-quality genomes originating from human, avian, and canine hosts were classified on the basis of their accessory gene content using pangenomic. Pangenomic clusters and subclusters were specifically and significantly associated with hosts. The functions of clustering accessory genes were mainly enriched in functions involved in DNA acquisition, interactions, and virulence (e.g., pathogenesis, response to biotic stimulus and interaction between organisms). Accordingly, networks of cooccurrent host interaction factors were significantly associated with the pangenomic clusters and the originating hosts. The avian strains exhibited a specific content in virulence factors. Rarely found in humans, they corresponded to pathovars responsible for severe human infections. An emerging subcluster significantly associated with both human and canine hosts was evidenced. This ability to significantly colonize canine hosts in addition to humans was associated with a specific content in virulence factors (VFs) and metabolic functions encoded by a new pathogenicity island in ST131 and an improved fitness that is probably involved in its emergence. Overall, VF content, unlike the determinants of antimicrobial resistance, appeared as a key actor of bacterial host adaptation. The host dimension emerges as a major driver of genetic evolution that shapes ST131 genome, enhances its diversity, and favors its dissemination. IMPORTANCE Until now, there has been no indication that the evolutionary dynamics of Escherichia coli ST131 may reflect independent and host-specific adaptation of this lineage outside humans. In contrast, the limited number of ST131 reports in animals supported the common view that it rather reflects a spillover of the human sector. This study uncovered a link between host, ST131 population structure, and virulence factor content which appeared to reflect adaptation to hosts. This study helps to better understand the reservoir of ST131, the putative transmission flux, associated risks and the evolutionary dynamics of this bacterial population and highlights a paradigm in which host colonization stands as a key ecological force of the ST131 evolution.""","""['Richard Bonnet', 'Racha Beyrouthy', 'Marisa Haenni', 'Marie-Hélène Nicolas-Chanoine', 'Guillaume Dalmasso', 'Jean-Yves Madec']""","""[' Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (UMR 1071), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (USC-2018), Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ' Centre National de Référence de la Résistance aux Antibiotiques, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ' Unité Antibiorésistance et Virulence Bactériennes, Anses Laboratoire de Lyon-Université de Lyon, Lyon, France.', ' Université de Paris, INSERM, IAME, Paris, France.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""mBio""","""['Genomic Epidemiology and Evolution of Escherichia coli in Wild Animals in Mexico.', 'Arrangements of Mobile Genetic Elements among Virotype E Subpopulation of Escherichia coli Sequence Type 131 Strains with High Antimicrobial Resistance and Virulence Gene Content.', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis of Globally Dominant ST131 Clone with Other Epidemiologically Successful Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) Lineages.', 'Multidrug-resistant extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli of sequence type ST131 in animals and foods.', 'Escherichia coli ST131, an intriguing clonal group.', 'Genome-wide association reveals host-specific genomic traits in Escherichia coli.', 'Identification of genes influencing the evolution of Escherichia coli ST372 in dogs and humans.', 'Dynamics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance genes in Escherichia coli from Europe and North America.', 'The cnf1 gene is associated with an expanding Escherichia coli ST131 H30Rx/C2 subclade and confers a competitive advantage for gut colonization.', 'Global Distribution of Fluoroquinolone and Colistin Resistance and Associated Resistance Markers in Escherichia coli of Swine Origin - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

The social-emotional health of children who have had surgery for hydrocephalus is not well characterized. In this study, the authors sought to examine social-emotional functioning using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Third Edition (BASC-3) and the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) in 66 children aged 5 to 17 years.  Methods:   Caregivers of pediatric patients with hydrocephalus completed the BASC-3 and the HOQ. BASC-3 internalizing, externalizing, and executive functioning caregiver-reported scores were compared with the BASC-3 normative sample using one-sample t-tests to evaluate overall social-emotional functioning. BASC-3 scores were correlated with the social-emotional domain of the HOQ using Pearson's r to determine if the HOQ accurately captured the social-emotional functioning of children with hydrocephalus in a neurosurgery setting. BASC-3 and HOQ scores of children with different etiologies of hydrocephalus were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance to determine if differences existed between the following etiologies: intraventricular hemorrhage secondary to prematurity, myelomeningocele, communicating congenital hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, or other.  Results:   Children with hydrocephalus of all etiologies had more difficulties with social-emotional functioning compared with normative populations. Children with different hydrocephalus etiologies differed in executive functioning and overall HOQ scores but not in internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, or social-emotional HOQ scores. The social-emotional domain of the HOQ correlated more strongly with the BASC-3 than did the physical and cognitive domains.

Results:   Veterans reporting baseline opioid use (n = 80) had significantly worse RMDQ (16.0 ± 4.9 vs. 13.4 ± 4.2, P < .0001), GCPS (68.7 ± 12.0 vs. 65.0 ± 14.4, P = .049), BPI Interference (6.2 ± 2.2 vs. 5.0 ± 2.1, P < .0001), and depression (PHQ-9 12.5 ± 6.2 vs. 10.6 ± 5.7, P = .016) compared to veterans not reporting baseline opioid use. Using multivariable modeling we found that baseline opioid use moderated the intervention effect on pain-related disability (RMDQ) at 9 months (interaction Beta = -3.88, P = .0064) but not pain intensity or interference.

Methods:   Following the reporting of the index case of autochthonous dengue, epidemiological investigation, vector control and substances of human origin safety measures were immediately activated, according to the national arbovirus surveillance plan. Dengue cases were followed-up with weekly visits and laboratory tests until recovery and clearance of viral RNA from blood.  Results:   The primary dengue case was identified in a young woman, who developed fever after returning from Indonesia to northern Italy, on 27 July 2020. She spent the mandatory quarantine for COVID-19 at home with relatives, six of whom developed dengue within two weeks. Epidemiological investigation identified further five autochthonous dengue cases among people who lived or stayed near the residence of the primary case. The last case of the outbreak developed fever on 29 September 2020. Dengue cases had a mild febrile illness, except one with persistent asthenia and myalgia. DENV-1 RNA was detected in blood and/or urine in all autochthonous cases, up to 35 days after fever onset. All cases developed IgM and IgG antibodies which cross-reacted with West Nile virus (WNV) and other flaviviruses. Sequencing of the full viral genome from blood samples showed over 99% nucleotide identity with DENV-1 strains isolated in China in 2014-2015; phylogenetic analysis classified the virus within Genotype I. Entomological site inspection identified a high density of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which conceivably sustained local DENV-1 transmission. Aedes koreicus mosquitoes were also collected in the site.  Conclusions:   Areas in Europe with high density of Aedes mosquitoes should be considered at risk for dengue transmission.

Although existing data-driven probability models can inform transport decision-making at an epidemiological level, we propose a novel mathematical, physiologically derived framework that provides insight into how patient characteristics underlying infarct core growth influence these decisions.  Methods:   We represent the physiology of time-dependent infarct core growth within an ischemic penumbra as an exponential function with consideration to rate-determining collateral blood flow. Monte Carlo methods generate distributions of infarct core volumes, which are translated to distributions of 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores. We apply the model to a stroke network that serves rural Bastrop County and urban Travis County by simulating transport strategies from thousands of potential patient pickup locations. In every pickup location, the simulation yields a distribution of outcomes corresponding to each transport strategy. A 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Student t test determine which transport strategy provides a significantly better probability of a good outcome for a given pickup location in each respective county (P<0.01).  Results:   In Travis County, drip and ship provides significantly better probabilities of a good outcome in 24.0% of the pickup locations, while 59.8% favor mothership. In Bastrop County, 11.3% of the pickup locations favor drip and ship, while only 7.1% favor mothership. The remaining pickup locations in each county are not statistically significant in either direction. We also reveal how differing rates of infarct core growth, the application of bypass policies, and the use of large vessel occlusion field tests impact these results.  Conclusions:   Modeling stroke physiology enables the use of clinically relevant metrics for determining comparative significance between drip and ship and mothership in a given geography. This formalism can help understand and inform emergency medical service transport decision-making, as well as regional bypass policies.""","""['Daniel A Paydarfar', 'David Paydarfar', 'Peter J Mucha', 'Joshua Chang']""","""[' Carolina Center for Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics (D.A.P., P.J.M.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', ' Departments of Neurology (D.P., J.C.), Dell Medical School, Mulva Clinic for the Neurosciences and Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin.', ' Population Health (J.C.), Dell Medical School, Mulva Clinic for the Neurosciences and Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Stroke""","""['Modeling Stroke Patient Transport for All Patients With Suspected Large-Vessel Occlusion.', 'Optimal Transport Destination for Ischemic Stroke Patients With Unknown Vessel Status: Use of Prehospital Triage Scores.', 'Two Paradigms for Endovascular Thrombectomy After Intravenous Thrombolysis for Acute Ischemic Stroke.', 'Mothership or drip and ship?.', 'Pathway Design for Acute Stroke Care in the Era of Endovascular Thrombectomy: A Critical Overview of Optimization Efforts.']"""

In practice, FH is commonly a clinical diagnosis without confirmation of a causative mutation. In this study, we sought to characterize and compare monogenic and clinically defined FH in a large sample of Icelanders. Approach and Results: We whole-genome sequenced 49 962 Icelanders and imputed the identified variants into an overall sample of 166 281 chip-genotyped Icelanders. We identified 20 FH mutations in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 with combined prevalence of 1 in 836. Monogenic FH was associated with severely elevated LDL-C levels and increased risk of premature coronary disease, aortic valve stenosis, and high burden of coronary atherosclerosis. We used a modified version of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria to screen for the clinical FH phenotype among living adult participants (N=79 058). Clinical FH was found in 2.2% of participants, of whom only 5.2% had monogenic FH. Mutation-negative clinical FH has a strong polygenic basis. Both individuals with monogenic FH and individuals with mutation-negative clinical FH were markedly undertreated with cholesterol-lowering medications and only a minority attained an LDL-C target of <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL; 11.0% and 24.9%, respectively) or <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL; 0.0% and 5.2%, respectively), as recommended for primary prevention by European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society cholesterol guidelines.

In the CSPS.com trial, aspirin or clopidogrel was used as the underlying antiplatelet drug. The effectiveness and safety of each combination were examined and clarified.  Methods:   In the CSPS.com trial, a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study, patients with high-risk, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke 8 to 180 days after onset treated with aspirin or clopidogrel alone at the discretion of the physician in charge were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy or DAPT using cilostazol and followed for 0.5 to 3.5 years. The primary efficacy outcome was first recurrence of ischemic stroke. The safety outcome was severe or life-threatening bleeding. The analysis was based on the underlying antiplatelet agents.  Results:   A total of 763 patients taking aspirin and 1116 taking clopidogrel were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Although the clopidogrel group had more risk factors than the aspirin group, the primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. In the aspirin group, the primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome did not differ significantly between the DAPT group and the aspirin-monotherapy group. In the clopidogrel group, the primary end point occurred at a rate of 2.31 per 100 patient-years in the DAPT group and 5.19 per 100 patient-years in the clopidogrel-monotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.447 [95% CI, 0.258–0.774]). Safety outcome did not differ significantly between groups (0.51 per 100 patient-years versus 0.71 per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.730 [95% CI, 0.206–2.588]).

Methods:   This study included 3787 adults aged ≥19 years who participated in the Korean National Environmental Health Survey 2015-2017, and investigated the association of toxic heavy metals with metabolic diseases. Lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) were measured either in urine (uHg, uCd) or total blood (bPb, bHg). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and DM cases were identified through a self-answered medication history. Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) as a surrogating index of NAFLD, was calculated using hepatic enzyme measurements, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  Results:   Adults in the highest quartile of bPb, bHg, and uHg showed significantly elevated odds of obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), compared to the lowest quartile (OR 1.58 for bPb, 1.92 for bHg, and 1.81 for uHg). HSI was positively correlated with bHg, uHg, and uCd concentrations. The odds of NAFLD (HSI ≥36) were also increased with increasing quartile of bHg, uHg, and uCd concentrations. For DM, bPb showed a significant negative association, while bHg and uCd exhibited non-monotonic and inconclusive associations.  Conclusions:   Among the general adult population of Korea, both Pb and Hg exposures were associated with an increased risk of obesity. In addition, both Hg and Cd exposures were associated with increased odds of NAFLD.

Large-scale surveillance of RNA viral infections in these animals is a fundamental step for controlling viral infectious diseases. Metagenomic analysis is a powerful method for virus identification with low bias and has contributed substantially to the discovery of novel viruses. Deep-sequencing data have been collected from diverse animals and accumulated in public databases, which can be valuable resources for identifying unknown viral sequences. Here, we screened for infections of 33 RNA viral families in publicly available mammalian and avian sequencing data and found approximately 900 hidden viral infections. We also discovered six nearly complete viral genomes in livestock, wild, and experimental animals: hepatovirus in a goat, hepeviruses in blind mole-rats and a galago, astrovirus in macaque monkeys, parechovirus in a cow, and pegivirus in tree shrews. Some of these viruses were phylogenetically close to human-pathogenic viruses, suggesting the potential risk of causing disease in humans upon infection. Furthermore, infections of five novel viruses were identified in several different individuals, indicating that their infections may have already spread in the natural host population. Our findings demonstrate the reusability of public sequencing data for surveying viral infections and identifying novel viral sequences, presenting a warning about a new threat of viral infectious disease to public health. IMPORTANCE Monitoring the spread of viral infections and identifying novel viruses capable of infecting humans through animal reservoirs are necessary to control emerging viral diseases. Massive amounts of sequencing data collected from various animals are publicly available, and these data may contain sequences originating from a wide variety of viruses. Here, we analyzed more than 46,000 public sequencing data and identified approximately 900 hidden RNA viral infections in mammalian and avian samples. Some viruses discovered in this study were genetically similar to pathogens that cause hepatitis, diarrhea, or encephalitis in humans, suggesting the presence of new threats to public health. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of reusing public sequencing data to identify known and unknown viral infections, indicating that future continuous monitoring of public sequencing data by metagenomic analyses would help prepare and mitigate future viral pandemics.""","""['Junna Kawasaki', 'Shohei Kojima', 'Keizo Tomonaga', 'Masayuki Horie']""","""[' Laboratory of RNA Viruses, Department of Virus Research, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ' Laboratory of RNA Viruses, Department of Mammalian Regulatory Network, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ' Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ' Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ' Division of Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""mBio""","""['Predicting reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors from evolutionary signatures in RNA virus genomes.', 'Virus Metagenomics in Farm Animals: A Systematic Review.', 'Statoviruses, A novel taxon of RNA viruses present in the gastrointestinal tracts of diverse mammals.', 'Large-scale investigation of zoonotic viruses in the era of high-throughput sequencing.', 'Next generation sequencing technologies: tool to study avian virus diversity.', 'The First Identification of a Narnavirus in Bigyra, a Marine Protist.', 'Discovery of novel papillomaviruses in the critically endangered Malayan and Chinese pangolins.', 'Is the Intergenic Region of Aedes aegypti Totivirus a Recombination Hotspot?', 'Novel hepatoviruses in synanthropic bats in the upper Midwestern United States.', 'Association of Common Zoonotic Pathogens With Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.']"""

Objectives:   We compared the effects of empagliflozin vs. sitagliptin therapy on myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) using dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.  Methods:   In total, 100 patients with type 2 diabetes, CAD and an MPR <2.5 were randomized to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or sitagliptin (100 mg once daily). Dynamic SPECT examinations were performed at baseline and at 6 months. The primary endpoint was the percent change of global MPR. Evaluable SPECT data were available for 98 patients.  Results:   Baseline clinical characteristics and SPECT data were well balanced between the two groups. At a 6-month follow-up, the fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels significantly decreased in both groups. Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels significantly increased in the empagliflozin group but not in the sitagliptin group. The global MPR significantly improved after treatment in both groups (34.5 ± 70.6%; P = 0.005 for empagliflozin vs. 22.4 ± 45.7%; P = 0.024 for sitagliptin).

Background: Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for substance misuse and substance use disorder (SUD) in adolescence and (early) adulthood. ADHD and SUD also frequently co-occur in treatment-seeking adolescents, which complicates diagnosis and treatment and is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Research on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on the prevention of adolescent SUD is inconclusive, and studies on the diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD and SUD are scarce. Thus, the available evidence is generally not sufficient to justify robust treatment recommendations. Objective: The aim of the study was to obtain a consensus statement based on a combination of scientific data and clinical experience. Method: A modified Delphi study to reach consensus based upon the combination of scientific data and clinical experience with a multidisciplinary group of 55 experts from 17 countries. The experts were asked to rate a set of statements on the effect of treatment of childhood ADHD on adolescent SUD and on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescents with comorbid ADHD and SUD. Results: After 3 iterative rounds of rating and adapting 37 statements, consensus was reached on 36 of these statements representing 6 domains: general (n = 4), risk of developing SUD (n = 3), screening and diagnosis (n = 7), psychosocial treatment (n = 5), pharmacological treatment (n = 11), and complementary treatments (n = 7). Routine screening is recommended for ADHD in adolescent patients in substance abuse treatment and for SUD in adolescent patients with ADHD in mental healthcare settings. Long-acting stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment of ADHD in adolescents with concurrent ADHD and SUD, and pharmacotherapy should preferably be embedded in psychosocial treatment. The only remaining no-consensus statement concerned the requirement of abstinence before starting pharmacological treatment in adolescents with ADHD and concurrent SUD. In contrast to the majority, some experts required full abstinence before starting any pharmacological treatment, some were against the use of stimulants in the treatment of these patients (independent of abstinence), while some were against the alternative use of bupropion. Conclusion: This international consensus statement can be used by clinicians and patients together in a shared decision-making process to select the best interventions and to reach optimal outcomes in adolescent patients with concurrent ADHD and SUD.""","""['Heval Özgen', 'Renske Spijkerman', 'Moritz Noack', 'Martin Holtmann', 'Arnt S A Schellekens', 'Geurt van de Glind', 'Tobias Banaschewski', 'Csaba Barta', 'Alex Begeman', 'Miguel Casas', 'Cleo L Crunelle', 'Constanza Daigre Blanco', 'Søren Dalsgaard', 'Zsolt Demetrovics', 'Jacomine den Boer', 'Geert Dom', 'Valsamma Eapen', 'Stephen V Faraone', 'Johan Franck', 'Rafael A González', 'Lara Grau-López', 'Annabeth P Groenman', 'Malin Hemphälä', 'Romain Icick', 'Brian Johnson', 'Michael Kaess', 'Máté Kapitány-Fövény', 'John G Kasinathan', 'Sharlene S Kaye', 'Falk Kiefer', 'Maija Konstenius', 'Frances R Levin', 'Mathias Luderer', 'Giovanni Martinotti', 'Frieda I A Matthys', 'Gergely Meszaros', 'Franz Moggi', 'Ashmita P Munasur-Naidoo', 'Marianne Post', 'Sharon Rabinovitz', 'J Antoni Ramos-Quiroga', 'Regina Sala', 'Abu Shafi', 'Ortal Slobodin', 'Wouter G Staal', 'Rainer Thomasius', 'Ilse Truter', 'Michiel W van Kernebeek', 'Maria C Velez-Pastrana', 'Sabine Vollstädt-Klein', 'Florence Vorspan', 'Jesse T Young', 'Amy Yule', 'Wim van den Brink', 'Vincent Hendriks']""","""[' Diese Autor_innen haben zu gleichen Teilen zu diesem Beitrag beigetragen.', ' Parnassia Addiction Research Centre (PARC), Parnassia Psychiatric Institute, Den Haag, Niederlande.', ' Curium, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Niederlande.', ' LWL-Universitätsklinik Hamm der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Hamm, Deutschland.', ' Department of Psychiatry, Donders institute, Radboud UMC, Nijmegen, Niederlande.', ' Nijmegen Institute for Scientist-Practitioners in Addiction (NISPA), Radboud UMC, Nijmegen, Niederlande.', ' International Collaboration on ADHD and Substance Abuse (ICASA) Foundation, Nijmegen, Niederlande.', ' Klinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie des Kindes- und Jugendalters, Zentralinstitut für Seelische Gesundheit, Mannheim, Deutschland.', ' Department of Medical Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Pathobiochemistry, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Ungarn.', '0 Institute of Psychology, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Ungarn.', '1 De Hoop GGZ, Dordrecht, Niederlande.', '2 Department of Psychiatry and Legal Medicine, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spanien.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Brussels, Brüssel, Belgien.', ""4 Department of Psychiatry, Mental Health and Addictions, Addiction and Dual Diagnosis Section, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spanien."", ""5 Group of Psychiatry, Mental Health and Addictions, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Barcelona, Spanien."", '6 Biomedical Network Research Centre on Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Barcelona, Spanien.', '7 Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Dänemark.', '8 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Ungarn.', '9 Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute (CAPRI), Antwerp University (UA), Antwerpen, Belgien.', '0 Academic Unit of Infant, Child, Adolescent Psychiatry South West Sydney, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australien.', '1 Department of Psychiatry, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA.', '2 Child- and Adolescent Department, Piteå Hospital, Region Norrbotten, Piteå, Schweden.', '3 Centre for Mental Health, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, Vereinigtes Königreich.', '4 East London NHS Foundation Trust, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) -

In the United States, anthrax outbreaks occur in wildlife and livestock, with frequent outbreaks in native and exotic wildlife species in Texas, livestock outbreaks in the Dakotas, and sporadic mixed outbreaks in Montana. Understanding where pathogen and host habitat selection overlap is essential for anthrax management. Resource selection and habitat use of ungulates may be sex-specific and lead to differential anthrax exposure risks across the landscape for males and females. We evaluated female elk (Cervus canadensis) resource selection in the same study areas as male elk in a previous anthrax risk study to identify risk of anthrax transmission to females and compare transmission risk between females and males. We developed a generalized linear mixed-effect model to estimate resource selection for female elk in southwest Montana during the June to August anthrax transmission risk period. We then predicted habitat selection of female and male elk across the study area and compared selection with the distribution of anthrax risk to identify spatial distributions of potential anthrax exposure for the male and female elk. Female and male elk selected different resources during the anthrax risk period, which resulted in different anthrax exposure areas for females and males. The sex-specific resource selection and habitat use could infer different areas of risk for anthrax transmission, which can improve anthrax and wildlife management and have important public health and economic implications.""","""['Anni Yang', 'Kelly M Proffitt', 'Valpa Asher', 'Sadie J Ryan', 'Jason K Blackburn']""","""[' Spatial Epidemiology and Ecology Research Laboratory, Department of Geography, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', ' Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, Bozeman, MT 59718, USA.', ' Turner Enterprises, 1123 Research Drive, Bozeman, MT 59718, USA.', ' Quantitative Disease Ecology and Conservation Laboratory, Department of Geography, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""J Wildl Manage""","""['Elk Resource Selection and Implications for Anthrax Management in Montana.', 'Potential Bacillus anthracis Risk Zones for Male Plains Bison ( Bison bison bison) in Southwestern Montana, USA.', 'Predicting Disease Risk, Identifying Stakeholders, and Informing Control Strategies: A Case Study of Anthrax in Montana.', 'Chronic wasting disease of cervids.', 'Anthrax outbreaks in the humans - livestock and wildlife interface areas of Northern Tanzania: a\xa0retrospective record review 2006-2016.', 'Deriving spatially explicit direct and indirect interaction networks from animal movement data.', 'Malaria transmission in Nepal under climate change: anticipated shifts in extent and season, and comparison with risk definitions for intervention.', 'Some Peculiarities of Anthrax Epidemiology in Herbivorous and Carnivorous Animals.']"""

In this context, health education activities are critical, especially in promoting early diagnosis and access to proper health care in sporotrichosis hyperendemic areas. Therefore, we report the implementation of a public specialised reference service (SRS) for diagnosis and treatment of sporotrichosis in southern Brazil. We evaluated the impact of the SRS on diagnostic confirmation and speed of diagnosis.  Methods:   The SRS was implemented in Rio Grande City. We implemented a public service to promote the correct diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of human sporotrichosis cases. To study the impact of implementing SRS, the annual number of cases and the period between the appearance of lesions until diagnosis were compared, using prior data and that post-implementation.  Results:   The implementation of the SRS directly benefited almost 50 patients in only four years, with the collaboration of almost 50% of the local health groups, together with an increase of more than 200% in diagnosis confirmation and speed of diagnosis, showing the reach, impact and importance of the SRS.

We have previously shown that baseline hemodynamic measures reflecting aortic function are associated with future TAA expansion. However, whether serial arterial hemodynamic assessment further improves TAA growth assessment remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to compare single vs serial arterial hemodynamic assessments in the evaluation of future TAA growth.  Methods:   Eighty-six unoperated participants with TAA underwent noninvasive arterial hemodynamic assessment using arterial tonometry and echocardiography at baseline and after 1 year. Aortic diameter was measured serially with the use of standard imaging modalities. Stepwise multivariable linear regression was used to assess associations of baseline and 1-year change (Δ) in arterial hemodynamic measures with TAA growth.  Results:   Mean age was 62.7 ± 11.0 years; 79% were male. Mean aneurysm growth was 0.48 ± 0.54 mm/year after a follow-up of 2.96 ± 1.03 years. Yearly changes in arterial hemodynamic measures ranged from -3.2% to +4.2%. Linear regression results showed that while baseline arterial hemodynamic measures were independently associated with aneurysm growth (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity: β ± SE = 0.038 ± 0.013; aortic characteristic impedance: β ± SE = 0.002 ± 0.001; proximal aortic compliance: β ± SE = -0.011 ± 0.006; forward pressure wave amplitude: β ± SE 0.009 ± 0.002; reflected pressure wave amplitude: β ± SE = 0.017 ± 0.006; P < 0.05 for each), the 1-year Δ in these measures did not incrementally add to aneurysm growth assessment (P > 0.05 for each Δ).  Conclusions:   Although baseline measures of aortic function independently predict TAA expansion, 1-year changes in these measures do not improve this prediction. Thus, for TAA risk assessment purposes, a baseline assessment of aortic function may suffice, which simplifies its use for potential predictive algorithms.""","""['Owais Mian', 'Munir Boodhwani', 'Luc Beauchesne', 'Kwan-Leung Chan', 'Carole Dennie', 'George A Wells', 'Thais Coutinho']""","""[' Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ' Division of Cardiac Surgery, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ' Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ' Department of Radiology, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ' School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Cardiovascular Research Methods Centre, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ' Division of Cardiology, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Division of Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

We aimed to describe and examine the factors related to non-utilization of potential donors in our LDLT programme.  Methods:   This is an analysis of prospectively collected data on potential donors for an adult LDLT programme, between January 2017 and December 2019.  Results:   Fifty-five donors for 33 potential recipients were evaluated.

Surgery is the only curative modality for early-stage CRC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative damage biomarkers as well as enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in patients with CRC before and after tumor resection and in healthy controls. 60 patients with stage I/II colorectal adenocarcinoma and 43 healthy controls were recruited in this study. We measured plasma levels of oxidative damage biomarkers, including advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) at baseline and after tumor removal. We also evaluated the plasma activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as enzymatic antioxidants and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay for nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity. Patients with CRC had significantly higher AGE, AOPP, MDA, and ox-LDL and also FRAP levels and higher SOD and GPx and lower CAT activity levels compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). We did not observe any statistically significant correlation between redox biomarkers and the size and stage of the tumor.

However, the onset of these vascular complications has a major influence on the implementation of cancer therapy, resulting in worsening of the quality of cancer care and prognosis of patients with cancer.

In this study, raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded COVID-19 clinical testing data. SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected (95% positivity) in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new COVID-19 cases were 2.4 or more per 100,000 people. To adjust for variation in sample fecal content, four normalization biomarkers were evaluated: crAssphage, pepper mild mottle virus, Bacteroides ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and human 18S rRNA. Of these, crAssphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability. Both unnormalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal and signal normalized to crAssphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data (Kendall's Tau-b (τ)=0.43 and 0.38, respectively), but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data. Locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends, and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date (versus the result date) was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data.

Methods:   We performed an individual patient data analysis from the Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial (RAMPART) and the Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT) to assess incidence, patient characteristics and clinical course of misdiagnosed pPNES.  Results:   Among 980 patients aged 8 years or older diagnosed and treated for status epilepticus in RAMPART and ESETT, 79 (8.1%) were discharged with a final diagnosis of pPNES. The relative incidence was highest in adolescents and young adults (20.1%). The typical female preponderance seen in that age bracket was not evident in children and older adults. Adverse effects, including respiratory depression and intubation, were documented in 26% of patients with pPNES receiving benzodiazepines in RAMPART and 33% of patients receiving additional second-line medication in ESETT. In ESETT, patients who were treated with benzodiazepines before hospital admission had higher rates of unresponsiveness and severe adverse effects than those treated after admission, suggesting cumulative effects of accelerated treatment momentum. Across trials, one in five patients with pPNES were admitted to an intensive care unit.  Conclusions:   Misdiagnosis and treatment of pPNES as status epilepticus are a common and widespread problem with deleterious consequences. Mitigating it will require training of emergency staff in semiological diagnosis.

Preoperative oral carbohydrate and postoperative early oral feeding (POC-PEOF) as the basic nutrition administration in the ERAS program suffers from low adherence. The role and benefits of administering POC-PEOF in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. Therefore, the randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of POC-PEOF in elderly patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy with inflammation and patient self-reported symptom burden compared with the corresponding outcomes of traditional fasting protocols.  Methods:   Elderly patients with HCC (n = 126) were randomly assigned to two groups using the sealed envelope technique. Sixty-three patients were included in the intervention (POC-PEOF) group and received POC-PEOF administration, whereas the 63 patients in the control (FAST) group underwent conventional fasting. Acute-phase inflammation markers, patient self-reported symptom burdens, and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups.  Results:   The average age was 69.60 ± 5.00 years in the POC-PEOF group and 70.44 ± 6.15 years in the FAST group. Compared to prolonged fasting, POC-PEOF achieved significant positive results, including lower overall levels of inflammatory response mediators (CRP, IL-6) on postoperative day (POD) 1, POD 3, and POD 5 (P < 0.05), lower patient self-reported symptom burdens of thirst, hunger, anxiety and nausea (P < 0.05), faster gastrointestinal function return with shortened times to first flatus and first defecation (48.31 ± 13.24 h vs. 96.26 ± 23.12 h and 72.87 ± 21.12 h vs. 144.34 ± 23.31 h, and P = 0.034 and P = 0.013, respectively). Furthermore, the average postoperative hospitalization duration in the POC-PEOF group was shorter than that in the FAST group (6.93 ± 0.98 d vs. 8.12 ± 1.15 d, P = 0.042). There was no significant difference of total complications between the groups (25.39 % vs 36.51 %, RR 0.696, 95 % CI 0.408-0.187, P = 0.177).

We explored whether combined infusion of lidocaine plus dexmedetomidine had lower occurrence of PONV undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with general anesthesia.  Methods:   A total of 248 women undergoing elective laparoscopic hysterectomy were allocated into the following four groups: the control group (group C, n = 62) received an equal volume of saline, the lidocaine group (group L, n = 62) received intravenous lidocaine (bolus infusion of 1.5 mg/kg over 10 min, 1.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion), the dexmedetomidine group (group D, n = 62) received dexmedetomidine administration (bolus infusion of 0.5 µg/kg over 10 min, 0.4 µg/kg/h continuous infusion), and the lidocaine plus dexmedetomidine group (group LD, n = 62) received combination of lidocaine (bolus infusion of 1.5 mg/kg over 10 min, 1.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion) and dexmedetomidine administration (bolus infusion of 0.5 µg/kg over 10 min, 0.4 µg/kg/h continuous infusion). The primary outcome was the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and PONV during the first 48 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of total 24 h PONV after surgery, intraoperative remifentanil requirement, postoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and fentanyl consumption, the incidence of bradycardia, agitation, shivering, and mouth dry during post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay period.  Results:   The occurrence of nausea and PONV in group LD (5.0 and 8.3%) at 0-2 h after operation was lower than group C (21.7 and 28.3%) (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference with respect to occurrence of nausea and PONV in groups L (13.3 and 20.0%) and D (8.3 and 13.3%) at 0-2 h after operation compared to group C (21.7 and 28.3%). The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and PONV at 2-24 and 24-48 h after surgery in all four groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of total 24 h PONV in group LD (33.3%) was significantly decreased compared to group C (60.0%) (P < 0.05). The cumulative consumption of fentanyl at 6 and 12 h after surgery was significantly reduced in group LD compared to other three groups (P < 0.05). The pain VAS scores were significantly decreased at 2, 6, and 12 h after operation in group LD compared to other three groups (P < 0.05). Remifentanil dose in the intraoperative period was significantly lower in groups LD and D compared with groups C and L (P < 0.05). The number of mouth dry, bradycardia, and over sedation during the PACU stay period was markedly increased in group LD (28.3, 30.0, and 35.0%, respectively) compared with groups C (1.7, 1.7, and 3.3%, respectively) and L (3.3, 5.0, and 6.7%, respectively) (P < 0.05).

The study aimed to provide insights into the experiences of persons with dementia and their families during the early phases of the pandemic in India.  Methods:   This study adopted a mixed-method approach. One hundred and four persons with dementia and their caregivers were evaluated via telephone using validated instruments and a semi-structured interview guide. We used the quantitative data collected to establish a baseline, whereas qualitative data were analysed thematically.  Results:   The study revealed that persons with dementia and their caregivers experienced difficulties during the pandemic, which included worsening of behaviour, problems in accessing care, disruptions in functional activities and struggles in enforcing infection prevention contributing to caregiver distress. An important finding that emerged was the unchanging reality of caregiving for families. The relative success of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic contrasted with the lack of awareness and formal support for dementia.

This Delphi study aimed to reach consensus on the most important confounders which influence the association between low-grade systemic inflammation and musculoskeletal pain.  Methods:   The panel consisted of 48 experts. In Round 1, the experts proposed what they believed were important confounders. In Round 2, the experts indicated for each confounder whether they believed it was important (yes/no). At least 50% of experts had to indicate the confounder was important to be considered in the final round. In Round 3, the experts rated the importance of each confounder on a 7-point Likert scale. Consensus was reached if ≥75% of the experts considered the factor either extremely or moderately important.  Results:   In Round 1, 120 confounders were proposed, which were synthesized into 38 distinct factors. In Round 2, 33 confounders met the criterion to be considered important. In Round 3, consensus was reached for 14 confounders: acute illness/trauma, immune disease, medication use, endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic disease, other musculoskeletal conditions, age, handling of blood samples, sex, cancer, body composition, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, physical activity, and pain characteristics.

For the United States to achieve these benchmarks, public health responses must target high-risk populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), a group with high rates of HCV incidence and low rates of treatment uptake.  Objective:   To evaluate potential improvements in the HCV care cascade among PWID, focusing on improved testing, treatment uptake, and access to harm reduction.  Design, setting, and participants:   This decision analytic model used a differential equation-based dynamic transmission model based on data from New Hampshire, an illustrative state with a large number of PWID and limited HCV treatment infrastructure. Surveillance data through 2020 was used for model parameterization, and the final analysis was conducted in May 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Model forecasts of chronic HCV cases and advanced-stage HCV outcomes from 2022 to 2045.  Results:   A total of 6 scenarios were tested: (1) the base case, (2) improved harm reduction, (3) improved testing, (4) improved treatment, (5) improved testing and treatment, and (6) improved testing, treatment, and harm reduction. All scenarios with improved testing, treatment uptake, and/or access to harm reduction were associated with decreases in forecasted HCV prevalence and HCV-associated mortality compared with the base case. Improving harm reduction, testing, and treatment individually were forecast to reduce prevalence of HCV in 2045 from 69.7% in the base case to 62.8%, 45.7%, and 35.5%, respectively. Combining treatment and testing improvements was associated with a 2045 prevalence of 0.3%; adding harm reduction improvements was associated with further reductions in prevalence forecasts (to 0.2%), with fewer total treatments (10 960 vs 13 219 from 2022-2045).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this modeling study, no single intervention was projected to achieve World Health Organization HCV elimination targets. Scenarios with improvements in both testing and treatment were associated with a prevalence of less than 3% by 2030 and achieved elimination targets. Adding improvements in harm reduction was associated with faster reductions in prevalence and fewer treatments.""","""['Andrew Blake', 'James E Smith']""","""["" Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ' Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Treatment and primary prevention in people who inject drugs for chronic hepatitis C infection: is elimination possible in a high-prevalence setting?', 'Modelling the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat in Iceland: A goal attainable by 2020.', 'Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions targeting harm reduction and chronic hepatitis C cascade of care in people who inject drugs: The case of France.', 'Is hepatitis C virus elimination possible among people living with HIV and what will it take to achieve it?', 'Is hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination achievable among people who inject drugs in Tijuana, Mexico?

Many studies had found a strong association between air pollutants and risk of death, but few had focused on the effects of six pollutants and rural areas. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of six air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2) on non-accidental and respiratory deaths in rural areas of Anhui Province by adjusting for confounding factors, and to further clarify which populations were susceptible to death associated with air pollution. In the first phase of the analysis, the generalized additive models were combined with the distributed lag non-linear models to evaluate the individual effects of air pollution on death in each area. In the second stage, random-effects models were used to aggregate the associations between air pollutants and mortality risk in nine areas. Overall, six pollutants had the strongest effects on the risk of death on the lag 07 days. The associations between PM2.5 and NO2 and daily non-accidental deaths were strongest, with maximum RR (lag 07): 1.63 (1.37-1.88) and 1.67 (1.37-1.96). The maximum pooled effects of association between six air pollutants and RD were PM2.5, with RR (lag 07): 1.89 (1.45-2.34). PM2.5 and PM10 had significant differences between the elderly and the non-elderly with respectively, RRR: 1.22 (1.04-1.41) and 1.26 (1.11-1.42).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 207 patients (Study Group n=54, Historical Group n=153) with metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled. All of them received 6 administrations of the 5-FU based regimens. Initial 5-FU dosing of all patients was calculated using body surface area (BSA). In the Study Group, individual exposure during each cycle was measured using a nanoparticle immunoassay, and the 5-FU blood concentration was calculated using the area under the curve (AUC). We adjusted the 5-FU infusion dose of the next cycle based on the AUC data of the previous cycle to achieve the target of 20-30 mg×h/L. RESULTS In the fourth cycle, patients in the target concentration range (AUC mean, 26.3 mg×h/L; Median, 28 mg×h/L; Range, 14-38 mg×h/L; CV, 22.4%) accounted for 46.8% of all patients, which were more than the ones in the first cycle (P<0.001). 5-FU TDM significantly reduced the toxicity of chemotherapy and improved its efficacy. The Study Group (30/289) showed a lower percentage of severe adverse events than that in the Historical Group (185/447) (P<0.001). The incidences of complete response and partial response in the Study Group were higher than those in the Historical Group (P=0.032).

Because of the increasing age of women at childbirth, fertility becomes a major challenge. We present 20 years of experience with two-step less radical fertility-sparing surgery in women with IA1, LVSI positive, IA2 and IB1 (<2 cm, infiltration less than half of stromal invasions.  Materials and method:   Preoperative workout consisted of histopathological diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging along with ultrasonographic volumetry. We then performed laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) with frozen section (FS) followed by PLND and ""selective parametrectomy"" (removal of afferent lymphatic channels from the paracervix) in case of a negative result. If verified by definitive histopathology, patients were treated by simple trachelectomy (IB1) or large cone (IA1/IA2) biopsy 1 week after primary surgery.  Results:   From 1999 to 2018, 91 women were enrolled in the study (median age 29.1 years, range 21-40). Of these 91 women, 51 (56.0%) were nulliparous. The detection rate of SLNs was 100% per patient and the specific side detection rate 96.7%. Positive lymph nodes were diagnosed in nine cases (9.8%). These women then underwent RH. Fertility was spared in 80 women but 4 recurred locally (5.0%). The mortality rate was 0.0%. The median follow-up was 149 months.  Conclusion:   Less radical fertility-sparing surgery with SLNM is safe in cervical cancers <2 cm at the largest diameter and infiltrating less than half of the cervical stroma.

Methods:   Prospective study evaluating children aged under 16 years reporting DHRs to beta-lactams. Reactions were classified as immediate and non-immediate reactions. The workup included sIgE, skin testing, and drug provocation tests (DPTs) for immediate reactions and patch testing and DPTs for non-immediate ones.  Results:   Of the 510 children included, 133 were evaluated for immediate reactions and confirmed in 8.3%. Skin test/in vitro IgE contributed to diagnosing half of the cases. Selective reactions occurred with amoxicillin (63%), followed by common penicillin determinants (27%) and cephalosporins (0.9%). Among non-immediate reactions (11.4% of the 377 children evaluated), most required DPTs, 52.7% of which were positive at 6-7 days of drug challenge.

We investigated the clinical factors associated with the severity of OAB symptoms in treatment-naïve men with coexisting benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Methods:   We obtained records from a health promotion center database of male patients who visited between March 2019 and February 2020. Men without a history of treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, transrectal ultrasonography, medical history, and carotid duplex ultrasound for the evaluation of atherosclerosis. Benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS) was defined as an IPSS of eight points or higher. Patients with comorbidities that may affect their voiding function were excluded.  Results:   A total of 764 patients were divided into two groups based on their diagnosis: an OAB group and a non-OAB group. The non-OAB group consisted of 627 patients (82.1%) and the OAB group consisted of 137 patients (17.9%). Using multivariable analysis BPH/LUTS was identified as an independent risk factor for OAB. In the OAB group without BPH/LUTS, carotid atherosclerosis was significantly associated with the severity of OAB symptoms. A history of diabetes mellitus was the only variable that was associated with the severity of urinary urgency.

Tissue acidosis is a common symptom of RA. Acid-sensitive ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), a member of the extracellular H+-activated cation channel family, could be activated by changes in extracellular pH and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA. As the only cellular component in cartilage tissue, chondrocytes play an extremely important role in maintaining cartilage tissue homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether estrogen could protect acid-stimulated chondrocytes by regulating the expression of ASIC1a and explore the possible mechanism. The results showed that estrogen could protect against acid-induced chondrocyte injury by reducing ASIC1a protein expression. Moreover, lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladeniine (3-MA) could reverse the reduction of ASIC1a protein caused by estrogen, indicating that autophagy-lysosome pathway contributes to estrogen-induced degradation of ASIC1a protein. Furthermore, the down-regulation of ASIC1a expression by estrogen was attenuated by MPP, a specific inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor-alpha (Esrra), indicating that Esrra is involved in the process of estrogen regulating the expression of ASIC1a. Additionally, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase/unc-51-like kinase 1 (AMPK-ULK1) signaling pathway was activated by estrogen treatment, which was abrogated by Esrra-silencing, and AMPK-specific inhibitor Compound C pretreatment could reduce estrogen-induced downregulation of ASIC1a protein. Taken together, these results indicate that estrogen could promote autophagy-lysosome pathway-dependent ASIC1a protein degradation and protect against acidosis-induced cytotoxicity, the mechanisms of which might relate to Esrra-AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway.""","""['Jing-Wen Su', 'Shu-Fang Li', 'Jing-Jing Tao', 'Ya-Yun Xu', 'Ke Wang', 'Xue-Wen Qian', 'Ge Deng', 'Xiao-Qing Peng', 'Fei-Hu Chen']""","""[' The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, 230032, China.', ' The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, 230032, China; Anhui Key Laboratory of Bioactivity of Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', ' The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, 230032, China.

We aimed to identify distinct phenotypes among children with AR using data-driven techniques and to ascertain their association with patterns of symptoms, allergic sensitization, and comorbidities.  Methods:   We recruited 510 children with physician-diagnosed AR, of whom 205 (40%) had asthma. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify latent structure within the data set using 17 variables (allergic conjunctivitis, eczema, asthma, family history of asthma, family history of allergic rhinitis, skin sensitization to 8 common allergens, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy).  Results:   A four-class solution was selected as the optimal model based on statistical fit. We labeled latent classes as: (1) AR with grass mono-sensitization and conjunctivitis (n = 361, 70.8%); (2) AR with house dust mite sensitization and asthma (n = 75, 14.7%); (3) AR with pet and grass polysensitization and conjunctivitis (n = 35, 6.9%); and (4) AR among children with tonsils and adenoids removed (n = 39, 7.6%). Perennial AR was significantly more common among children in Class 2 (OR 5.83, 95% CI 3.42-9.94, p < .001) and Class 3 (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.36-6.13, p = .006). Mild and intermittent AR symptoms were significantly more common in children in Class 2 compared to those in Class 1. AR was more severe in Class 1 compared to other 3 classes, indicating that upper respiratory symptoms are more severe among children with isolated seasonal rhinitis, than in those with rhinitis and coexisting asthma.

The most effective approach to ED-based HIV screening remains unknown.  Objective:   To compare strategies for HIV screening when integrated into usual ED practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   This randomized clinical trial included patients visiting EDs at 4 US urban hospitals between April 2014 and January 2016. Patients included were ages 16 years or older, not critically ill or mentally altered, not known to have an HIV positive status, and with an anticipated length of stay 30 minutes or longer. Data were analyzed through March 2021.  Interventions:   Consecutive patients underwent concealed randomization to either nontargeted screening, enhanced targeted screening using a quantitative HIV risk prediction tool, or traditional targeted screening as adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Screening was integrated into clinical practice using opt-out consent and fourth-generation antigen-antibody assays.  Main outcomes and measures:   New HIV diagnoses using intention-to-treat analysis, absolute differences, and risk ratios (RRs).  Results:   A total of 76 561 patient visits were randomized; median (interquartile range) age was 40 (28-54) years, 34 807 patients (51.2%) were women, and 26 776 (39.4%) were Black, 22 131 (32.6%) non-Hispanic White, and 14 542 (21.4%) Hispanic. A total of 25 469 were randomized to nontargeted screening; 25 453, enhanced targeted screening; and 25 639, traditional targeted screening. Of the nontargeted group, 6744 participants (26.5%) completed testing and 10 (0.15%) were newly diagnosed; of the enhanced targeted group, 13 883 participants (54.5%) met risk criteria, 4488 (32.3%) completed testing, and 7 (0.16%) were newly diagnosed; and of the traditional targeted group, 7099 participants (27.7%) met risk criteria, 3173 (44.7%) completed testing, and 7 (0.22%) were newly diagnosed. When compared with nontargeted screening, targeted strategies were not associated with a higher rate of new diagnoses (enhanced targeted and traditional targeted combined: difference, -0.01%; 95% CI, -0.04% to 0.02%; RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.56; P = .38; and enhanced targeted only: difference, -0.01%; 95% CI, -0.04% to 0.02%; RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.84; P = .47).  Conclusions and relevance:   Targeted HIV screening was not superior to nontargeted HIV screening in the ED. Nontargeted screening resulted in significantly more tests performed, although all strategies identified relatively low numbers of new HIV diagnoses.

Bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients at increased risk of bleeding and low risk of recurrent ischemic events. We aimed to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individuals’ bleeding risk.  Methods:   We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE [Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events], ESPS-2 [European Stroke Prevention Study-2], MATCH [Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients], CHARISMA [Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance], ESPRIT [European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial], and PRoFESS [Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes]) investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase after noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to their predicted risk of major bleeding with the S2TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events was assessed per quintile for 4 scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenario.  Results:   Thirty seven thousand eighty-seven patients were included in the analyses. Both risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events increased over quintiles of predicted bleeding risk, but risk of ischemic events was consistently higher (eg, from 0.7%/y (bottom quintile) to 3.2%/y (top quintile) for major bleeding on aspirin and from 2.5%/y to 10.2%/y for risk of ischemic events on aspirin). Treatment with aspirin-clopidogrel led to more major bleedings (0.9%–1.7% per year), than reduction in ischemic events (ranging from 0.4% to 0.9/1.0% per year) across all quintiles.

Methods:   We used pooled data from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health. The analytic sample was limited to children 1 to 17 years old, including 23 099 CYSHCN and 75 612 children without special health care needs (non-CYSHCN). Parent- and caregiver-reported measures of oral health problems were fair or poor teeth condition, decayed teeth and cavities, toothaches, and bleeding gums. POH services were preventive dental visits, cleanings, tooth brushing and oral health care instructions, fluoride, and sealants. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted.  Results:   A higher proportion of CYSHCN than non-CYSHCN received a preventive dental visit in the past year (84% vs 78%, P < .0001). Similar patterns were found for the specific preventive services examined. However, CYSHCN had higher rates of oral health problems compared with non-CYSHCN. For example, decayed teeth and cavities were reported in 16% of CYSHCN versus 11% in non-CYSHCN (P < .0001). In adjusted analyses, several factors were significantly associated with decreased prevalence of receipt of POH services among CYSHCN, including younger or older age, lower household education, non-English language, lack of health insurance, lack of a medical home, and worse condition of teeth.  Conclusions:   CYSHCN have higher rates of POH service use yet worse oral health status than non-CYSHCN.

Therefore, elaborate analysis of different temperature exposure patterns, such as cumulative heat exposure within a time period and transient exposure at a particular time point, is of important public health significance. This study aims to utilize hourly temperature data to better capture the effects of cumulative and transient heat exposures on schizophrenia during the warm season in Hefei, China. We included the daily mean temperature and daily schizophrenia hospitalizations into the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to simulate the exposure-response curve and determine the heat threshold (19.4 °C). We calculated and applied a novel indicator-daily excess hourly heat (DEHH)-to examine the effects of cumulative heat exposure over a day on schizophrenia hospitalizations. Temperature measurements at each time point were also incorporated in the DLNM as independent exposure indicators to analyze the impact of transient heat exposure on schizophrenia. Each increment of interquartile range (IQR) in DEHH was associated with elevated risk of schizophrenia hospitalizations from lag 1 (RR = 1.036, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.016, 1.057) to lag 4 (RR = 1.025, 95% CI: 1.005, 1.046). Men and people over 40 years old were more susceptible to DEHH. Besides, we found a greater risk of heat-related schizophrenia hospitalizations between 0 a.m. and 6 a.m. This study revealed the adverse effects of accumulated and transient heat exposures on schizophrenia hospitalizations.

Methods:   Randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 primary care practices. Children aged 5 to 12 years old with ADHD were randomly assigned to care management + portal or portal alone. The portal included parent-reported treatment preferences and goals, medication side effects, and parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptom scales. Care managers provided education to families; communicated quarterly with parents, teachers, and clinicians; and coordinated care. The main outcome, changes in the Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale (VPRS) score as a measure of ADHD symptoms, was assessed using intention-to-treat analysis.  Results:   A total of 303 eligible children (69% male; 46% Black) were randomly assigned, and 273 (90%) completed the study. During the 9-month study, parents in the care management + portal arm communicated inconsistently with care managers (mean 2.2; range 0-6) but similarly used the portal (mean 2.3 vs 2.2) as parents in the portal alone arm. In multivariate models, VPRS scores decreased over time (Adjusted β = -.015; 95% confidence interval -0.023 to -0.07) in both groups, but there were no intervention-by-time effects (Adjusted β = .000; 95% confidence interval -0.011 to 0.012) between groups.

Under the condition of stratification by tumor stage, signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) presented the worst survival in each stage of right colon cancer (stage I, log-rank, p = 0.002, stages II, III, and IV, log-rank, p < 0.001), rectal cancer (RC) (log-rank, p < 0.001), and in stages II, III, and IV of left colon cancer (log-rank, p < 0.001). Multivariate survival analysis suggested SRCC subtype, male gender, age ≥ 70 years, tumor size ≥ 5 cm, stage progression, and poor differentiation were all significant factors worsening survival in CRC (p < 0.001, respectively). Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC) histological subtype proved to be an independent protective factor for the prognosis of right colon cancer (p = 0.003). Overall, in our study, the results suggested SRCC had the worst survival among the three histological subtypes of CRC.

DTG is now approved as Tivicay tablets in over 120 countries and Triumeq combination tablets (DTG/abacavir [ABC]/lamivudine [3TC]) in over 90 countries. In Japan, these formulations have been marketed since 2014 and 2015. The post-marketing prospective surveillance has been conducted as part of the HIV-Related Drug (HRD) cooperative survey aimed to collect actual drug use information in all of these DTG-treated patients in accordance with conditions for initial approvals.  Methods:   The survey has been conducted to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of DTG since 2014, for approximately 6 years. The safety was evaluated by incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and change in body weight. The effectiveness was evaluated by plasma HIV RNA copies/mL and peripheral CD4+ cell counts.  Results:   Of 2292 patients in 30 Japanese sites, 565 (24.65%) reported ADRs. The most common ADR was blood creatinine increased (4.28%). Incidence of ADRs was statistically significantly higher in patients with severe symptoms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] categories B and C) than those with category A, and in patients with comorbidities than those without comorbidities. Whereas incidence of ADRs was statistically significantly lower in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced patients than that in ART-naïve patients. Incidence of ADRs related to suicide or self-injurious behavior was statistically significantly higher in patients with comorbidities of psychiatric disorders than those without comorbidities. The body weight tended to increase over time and those changes and percentage changes from baseline were greater in ART-naïve patients compared with ART-experienced patients. HIV RNA copies/mL and CD4+ cell counts showed favorable shifts from baseline in both ART-naïve and ART-experienced patients.  Conclusion:   The results of the survey identified no new safety and effectiveness risks in Japanese patients with HIV/AIDS treated with DTG.""","""['Haruyuki Hongo', 'Takako Nagao', 'Kyoko Nakamura', 'Tomomi Kitaichi', 'Yuko Maeno', 'Teruhisa Tokunaga', 'Akiko Fukuda', 'Ichiro Koga']""","""[' Safety Control Department, ViiV Healthcare K.K., 1-8-1 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 107-0052, Japan. haruyuki.x.hongo@viivhealthcare.com.', ' Safety Control Department, ViiV Healthcare K.K., 1-8-1 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 107-0052, Japan.', ' Medical Affairs Unit, ViiV Healthcare K.K., Tokyo, Japan.', ' ViiV Healthcare K.K., Tokyo, Japan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Adv Ther""","""['Safety and Effectiveness Analyses of Dolutegravir/Lamivudine in Patients with HIV: 2-Year Report of Post-Marketing Surveillance in Japan.', 'The Cost-effectiveness and Budget Impact of 2-Drug Dolutegravir-Lamivudine Regimens for the Treatment of HIV Infection in the United States.', 'Doing More With Less: Review of Dolutegravir-Lamivudine, a Novel Single-Tablet Regimen for Antiretroviral-Naïve Adults With HIV-1 Infection.', 'Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Dolutegravir/Abacavir/Lamivudine Single-Tablet Regimen in a Real-Life Cohort of HIV-1 Adult Infected Patients.', 'DOLAMA study: Effectiveness, safety and pharmacoeconomic analysis of dual therapy with dolutegravir and lamivudine in virologically suppressed HIV-1 patients.', 'A Korean Post-Marketing Surveillance Study of Dolutegravir Single-Agent Tablets in Patients with HIV-1.']"""

As the results, we identified 358 genes differentially regulated and 15,029 ATF1 binding sites and demonstrated that ATF1 was widely involved in major signaling pathways in CRC, such as Wnt, TNF, Jak-STAT. Subsequently, by the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, we found that rs7017386 was associated with the expression of CCAT1 and PVT1 in the Wnt pathway. By a two-stage population study with 6,131 CRC cases and 10,022 healthy controls, we identified the variant was associated with CRC risk.

This study consisted of 3448 participants aged 20 years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 cycle and 2015-2016 cycle. Circulating levels of EO biomarker (hemoglobin adducts of EO (HbEO)) was measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression. The weighted median level of HbEO was 29.9 (95% CI: 21.8, 56.0) pmol/g Hb. Elevated levels of HbEO were associated with higher HbA1c and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (both Ptrend <0.01). After multivariate adjustment including demographics, lifestyle factors, and body mass index (BMI), higher HbEO levels were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The OR (95% CI) of diabetes across increasing quartiles of HbEO was 1.00 (reference), 1.45 (1.08, 1.96), 1.76 (1.31, 2.36), and 1.77 (1.22, 2.57), respectively (Ptrend <0.001).

One-third to half of the patients with CFM also present with extra craniofacial (ECF) malformations. The knowledge of the visceral alteration related to CFM is vital for optimized care and a better prognosis.  Aim:   To describe the incidence of ECF malformations in patients with CFM and to infer if there was a correlation between CFM and ECF malformations.  Materials and methods:   The authors analyzed medical records of patients diagnosed with CFM from 1996 to 2006. The data collected included age, gender, category of craniofacial alteration, and the type of ECF malformation when present. The sample was inspected to find possible correlations between craniofacial abnormalities and ECF malformations.  Results:   The sample included 102 patients, with a mean age of 7 years and a predominance of males (61.8%). Ear malformations (93.1%) followed by mandible (59.8%) and facial nerve (10.8%) abnormalities were the most common CFM. Among patients with CFM, 37.2% had ECF involvement, mainly in vertebrae (20%), heart (11%), and limbs (9.8%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of ear malformations was related to a higher incidence of nonspecific visceral malformations (P = 0.034) and that mandible malformation was related to an increased incidence of vertebral malformations (P = 0.008).  Conclusion:   A significant percentage of patients with CFM presented associated ECF impairment.

Although pharmacological preventive treatments have been shown to offer some benefit to youth with migraine, additional research is needed to understand whether and how these benefits are sustained.  Objective:   To survey clinical status of youth with migraine who participated in the 24-week Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) trial over a 3-year follow-up period.  Design, setting, and participants:   This survey study used internet-based surveys collected from youth ages 8 to 17 years at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after completion of the CHAMP trial, which randomized participants to amitriptyline, topiramate, or placebo. At the end of the trial, the study drug was stopped, and participants received clinical care of their choice thereafter. The CHAMP trial was conducted between May 2012 and November 2015, and survey follow-up was conducted June 2013 to June 2018. Participants in this survey study were representative of those randomized in the trial. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to April 2021.  Exposures:   Survey completion.  Main outcomes and measures:   Headache days, disability (assessed using the Pediatric Migraine Disability Scale [PedMIDAS]), and self-report of ongoing use of prescription preventive medication.  Results:   A total of 205 youth (mean [SD] age, 14.2 [2.3] years; 139 [68%] girls; mean [SD] history of migraine, 5.7 [3.1] years) participated in the survey. Retention of participants was 189 participants (92%) at month 6, 182 participants (88%) at month 12, 163 participants (80%) at month 18, 165 participants (80%) at month 24, and 155 participants (76%) at month 36. Over the course of the 3-year follow-up, participants consistently maintained meaningful reductions in headache days (mean [SD] headache days per 28 days: CHAMP baseline, 11.1 [6.0] days; CHAMP completion, 5.0 [5.7] days; 3-year follow-up, 6.1 [6.1] days) and disability (mean [SD] score: CHAMP baseline, 40.9 [26.4]; CHAMP completion, 17.9 [22.1]; 3-year follow-up, 12.3 [20.0]). At 3 years after completion of the CHAMP trial, headache days were approximately 1.5 per week (changed from about 3 per week at trial baseline) and disability had improved from the moderate range to the low mild range on the PedMIDAS. Longitudinal analyses showed that amitriptyline and topiramate did not explain intercept random effects for either mean rate of headache days per week (amitriptyline: estimate [SE], 0.07 [0.05]; P = .16; topiramate: estimate [SE], 0.04 [0.05]; P = .50) or headache disability PedMIDAS total score (amitriptyline: estimate [SE], 0.25 [0.38]; P = .52; topiramate: estimate [SE], -0.09 [0.39]; P = .82) changes over time. Of 153 participants who reported on prescription drug use at 3 years, only 1 participant (1%) reported using prevention medication, and most participants reported no medication use at most time points.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that children and adolescents with longer than 5 years history of migraine who participated in the CHAMP trial may sustain positive clinical outcomes over time, even after discontinuing preventive pill-based treatment. This survey study could inform use and discontinuation timing of pharmacological preventive therapies for migraine in youth ages 8 to 17 years. Research is needed to examine mechanisms of treatment improvement and maintenance for preventive therapies, as well as placebo, in the pediatric population.""","""['Scott W Powers', 'Christopher S Coffey', 'Leigh A Chamberlin', 'Dixie J Ecklund', 'Elizabeth A Klingner', 'Jon W Yankey', 'James L Peugh', 'Leslie L Korbee', 'Kerry Simmons', 'Stephanie M Sullivan', 'Marielle A Kabbouche', 'Joanne Kacperski', 'Linda L Porter', 'Brooke L Reidy', 'Andrew D Hershey']""","""["" Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", "" Cincinnati Children's Headache Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", ' Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Statistical and Data Management Center, University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City.', ' Academic Regulatory & Monitoring Services, Cincinnati, Ohio.', "" Office for Clinical and Translational Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", "" Division of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Implications of 3-Year Follow-up Data From the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention Medication Trial.', 'Multimodal Assessment of Medication Adherence Among Youth With Migraine: An Ancillary Study of the CHAMP Trial.', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy plus amitriptyline for chronic migraine in children and adolescents: a randomized clinical trial.', 'Impact of preventive pill-based treatment on migraine days: A secondary outcome study of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) trial and a comparison of self-report to nosology-derived assessments.', 'New Developments in the Prophylactic Drug Treatment of Pediatric Migraine: What Is New in 2017 and Where Does It Leave Us?', 'Migraine in Adults: Preventive Pharmacologic Treatments Internet.', 'Management of Chronic Migraine in Children and Adolescents: Where are We in 2022?', 'From the New Diagnostic Criteria to COVID-19 Pandemic Passing Through the Placebo Effect.

Objectives:   To assess the incidence of AUR in older adult men at hospital admission, its risk factors, and its outcome.  Methods:   The study comprised 111 older adult men aged ≥ 75 years who were admitted to three internal medicine departments. All men underwent post-void residual (PVR) urine volume measurement on the morning following admission by using a portable ultrasound bladder scan. AUR was defined as a PVR urine volume of ≥ 200 ml without symptoms. Men with AUR had a follow-up phone call concerning symptoms and urinary catheter status30 days following hospitalization.  Results:   Seven (6.3%) men had AUR. Relative to the 104 men without AUR, they had significantly higher prevalence of severe dependency (6/7 vs. 33/104, 85.7% vs. 31.7%, (P = 0.007), cognitive impairment (5/7 vs. 19/104, 71.4% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.005), and use of anticholinergic agents (4/7 vs. 19/104, 57.1% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.033). A urinary catheter was inserted in one man (14.3%), but it was removed later during hospitalization. No symptoms were reported and no urinary catheter was inserted following hospitalization in men with AUR.  Conclusions:   AUR in older adult men at hospital admission is uncommon and has a favorable outcome. Hence, screening for AUR in all older adult men at admission is not recommended, but it may be considered in severely dependent older adult men with cognitive impairment who use anticholinergic agents.""","""['Nadav Yehoshua Schacham', 'Arkady Schwarzman', 'Adi Brom', 'Mayan Gilboa', 'Asnat Groutz', 'Dan Justo']""","""[' Department of Geriatrics, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', ' Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ' Department of Internal Medicine T, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', ' Department of Internal Medicine D, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', "" Department of Urogynecology, Lis Maternity and Women's Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Isr Med Assoc J""","""['Geriatrics.', 'Management of acute urinary retention: a worldwide survey of 6074 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Asymptomatic urinary retention in elderly women upon admission to the Internal Medicine department: A prospective study.', 'Urinary bladder characteristics via ultrasound as predictors of acute urinary retention in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The Reten-World survey of the management of acute urinary retention: preliminary results.', 'Long-term aspects of medical treatment of BPH.']"""

The genotypes, drug susceptibilities of Candida pelliculosa strains, and clinical features of two outbreaks of neonatal candidemia caused by C. pelliculosa were analyzed, in order to provide evidence for the outbreaks and characteristics of C. pelliculosa neonatal candidemia.  Methodology:   The strains were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to investigate their genetic relatedness. The broth microdilution method was used to determine in vitro susceptibility of the isolates to antifungal drugs. Clinical features of the infected patients were collected to analyze the risks for C. pelliculosa infection.  Results:   Fourteen neonates, hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit from November 2012 to October 2013, were infected by C. pelliculosa. All 14 patients were cured after treatment with fluconazole and discharged without any complications. The C. pelliculosa isolates from the 14 patients were clustered into two groups, indicating that the outbreaks were caused by two types of strains. Eight of nine strains isolated from the 2013 outbreak were clustered into the same group, while one isolate was grouped together with five isolates from the 2012 outbreak. In vitro experiments demonstrated high antifungal activity of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, and 5-fluorocytosine to C. pelliculosa. The common symptoms of C. pelliculosa candidaemia were fever, cyanosis, polypnea, hypoactivity, and apnea.  Conclusions:   The current study revealed high in vitro susceptibility of C. pelliculosa to antifungals. As C. pelliculosa candidaemia cannot be characterized by clinical symptoms and routine blood testing alone, monitoring unusual strains isolated from immunodeficient hosts is very important to prevent possible outbreaks.""","""['Yulan Yang', 'Weiyuan Wu', 'Lu Ding', 'Lin Yang', 'Jinzhen Su', 'Benqing Wu']""","""["" Department of Neonatology, The Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518020, China."", "" Department of Laboratory Examination, The Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518020, China."", ' Department of Neonatology, University of the Chinese Academy of Science - Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518000, China. wubenqing783@126.com.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""J Infect Dev Ctries""","""['Reporting an outbreak of Candida pelliculosa fungemia in a neonatal intensive care unit.', 'Fungemia by Candida pelliculosa (Pichia anomala) in a neonatal intensive care unit: a possible clonal origin.', 'Risk factors and biofilm formation analyses of hospital-acquired infection of Candida pelliculosa in a neonatal intensive care unit.', 'Candida and candidaemia.

This sero-survey was designed for the first time in Pakistan to assess the exposure of butchers to E. granulosus as there was no previous report in the country for this occupational group.  Methodology:   Blood samples were collected from registered butchers (n = 364) in five different slaughterhouses in Faisalabad and Bahawalnagar Districts. Sera were tested for anti-Echinococcus granulosus IgG with a commercially available ELISA kit (specificity, 100%; sensitivity, 97%).  Results:   Overall, seroprevalence was 9.61% (35/364). Butchers >30 years of age (10.34%), those involved in small ruminants butchery (11.70%), >10 years' experience (10.04%), formal education level up to middle standard (10.28%), contact with dogs (12.71%), improper/unhygienic disposal of dog feces (11.87%), and those unaware of the consequences of eating with unwashed hands (13.80%) were more seropositive with significant statistical differences (p < 0.05). Variables like previous cyst encounter, no knowledge of zoonoses and/or cystic echinococcosis, living in rural areas and the presence of stray/feral dogs in surroundings did not show any significant association (p > 0.05) with seroprevalence in butchers. The binary logistic regression model also showed a statistically significant relationship (p < 0.05) for all risk factors found statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the univariate analysis.

In this study, we report on a waterborne outbreak of tularemia in the spring of 2013 in a region which was previously disease-free, and we investigated the reasons for the outbreak.  Methodology:   The index case, a 17-year-old male, was diagnosed with oropharyngeal tularemia. An outbreak investigation was initiated after receiving information from other patients with similar symptoms from the same village along with Balkıca, Tavas, and Denizli. An epidemiological and environmental investigation was conducted. Tonsil swab specimens/lymph node aspirates collected from patients, and water samples collected from unchlorinated drinking water sources, were cultured. Additionally, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on these samples. Serum samples from patients were analyzed for antibody response.  Results:   A total of 7 patients were found in this outbreak investigation. The attack rate was found to be 1% among the people of the village and 25% among patients' family members.

Design, setting, and participants:   This multicenter, prospective, single-group, open-label, phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted in 10 centers in southern China. Patients with M0 and either clinical T2 to T4 or N+ disease were enrolled between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020.  Interventions:   Eligible patients received apatinib (500 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 21 and discontinued in the last cycle) plus SOX (S-1: 40-60 mg orally twice daily on days 1 to 14; oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1) every 3 weeks for 2 to 5 cycles. A D2 gastrectomy was performed 2 to 4 weeks after the last cycle.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was R0 resection rate. Secondary end points were the response rate, toxic effects, and surgical outcome.  Results:   A total of 48 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [8.2] years; 37 men [77.1%]) were enrolled in this study. Forty patients underwent surgery (38 had gastrectomy, and 2 had exploratory laparotomy), with an R0 resection rate of 75.0% (95% CI, 60.4%-86.4%). The radiologic response rate was 75.0%, and T downstaging was observed in 16 of 44 patients (36.4%). The pathological response rate was 54.2% (95% CI, 39.2%-68.6%); moreover, this rate was significantly higher in patients who achieved a radiologic response compared with those who did not (12 [80.0%] vs 1 [20.0%]; P = .03) and in those who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score of 0 (20 [76.9%] vs 10 [45.5%]; P = .03) or had tumors located in the upper one-third of the stomach (16 [61.5%] vs 7 [31.8%]; P = .04). Patients who achieved a pathological response (vs those who did not) had significantly less blood loss (median [range]: 60 [10-200] mL vs 80 [20-300] mL; P = .04) and significantly more lymph nodes harvested (median [range]: 40 [24-67] vs 32 [19-51]; P = .04) during surgery.

Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden.  Objective:   To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity.  Design, setting, and participants:   A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5.  Results:   Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden.  Conclusions and relevance:   Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy.

To inform local decision-making about care and testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, 95 providers from 26 practices partnered with the local practice-based research network to rapidly collect and share data about children with COVID-19-like symptoms. Of 2162 children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, 9% had positive test results. Test result positivity was 33% if a patient was exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 and 4% if they had COVID-19-like symptoms and no exposure. School or day care attendance was associated with lower rates of positive test results. Although not originally planned, these findings drove local advocacy efforts by the Collaborative for increased access to testing and contact tracing and safe in-person school. Members communicated directly and collectively with local politicians, provided advice and resources for school boards and superintendent groups, and appeared on various media platforms. In these efforts, they shared local data, highlighting the lower rate of positive test results for children in school to support the idea that schools could be safely open.

Most are asymptomatic and are associated with a 7%-15% risk of malignancy (1). Methods: PubMed and Medline were searched for articles with a focus on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of TN over the past 5 y. Results: The increase in frequency of imaging has led to a rise in the incidence of incidentally diagnosed TN. The initial evaluation of a TN includes assessing thyroid function, clinical risk factors, and neck imaging. Ultrasound remains the gold standard for assessing TN morphology, and biopsy is the standard method for determining whether a TN is benign. Recently published risk stratification systems using morphologic characteristics on ultrasonography have been effective in reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies. Advances in molecular testing have reduced the number of surgical procedures performed for diagnostic purposes on asymptomatic TN with indeterminate cytology. Scintigraphy is the first-line study for assessing a hyperfunctioning nodule. Many TN can be followed clinically or with serial ultrasound after the initial diagnosis. Surgical intervention is warranted when local symptoms are present, in patients with clinical risk factors, as well as in most situations with malignant cytology. Active surveillance is an option in cases of micropapillary thyroid cancer. Emerging nonsurgical approaches for treating TN include ethanol ablation for TN; sclerotherapy for thyroid cysts; and thermal techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, microwaves, and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Conclusion: Most TN are benign and can be safely monitored. The indications for biopsy and frequency of imaging should be tailored on the basis of risk stratification. Treatment options should be individualized for each patient's particular situation.

Women ≥ 18 years of age (n = 706) presenting for emergency care after sexual assault to 13 emergency care sites were enrolled in the study. Women completed assessments at the time of presentation as well as at 1 week (n = 706, 100%) and 6 weeks (n = 630, 91%). Nearly 70% of women reported CSNWP at the time of emergency care (n = 475, 69%), which persisted to 6 weeks in approximately 2 in 5 survivors (n = 248, 41%). A structural equation model adjusted for age, race, past trauma exposure, and preassault pain levels suggested that posttraumatic alterations in arousal/reactivity symptoms 1 week after assault partially mediated the transition from acute to persistent CSNWP. A significant portion (41%) of women sexual assault survivors develop CSNWP 6 weeks postassault. Posttraumatic arousal/reactivity symptoms in the early aftermath of assault contribute to CSNWP development; such symptoms are potential targets for secondary preventive interventions to reduce chronic postassault pain.""","""['Nicole A Short', 'Andrew S Tungate', 'Kenneth A Bollen', 'Jenyth Sullivan', ""Teresa D'Anza"", 'Megan Lechner', 'Kathy Bell', 'Jenny Black', 'Jennie Buchanan', 'Rhiannon Reese', 'Jeffrey D Ho', 'Gordon D Reed', 'Melissa A Platt', 'Ralph J Riviello', 'Catherine H Rossi', 'Sandra L Martin', 'Israel Liberzon', 'Sheila A M Rauch', 'Ronald C Kessler', 'Nicole Nugent', 'Samuel A McLean']""","""[' Institute for Trauma Recovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', ' Departments of Anesthesiology and.', ' Psychology and Neuroscience, and Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', ' Albuquerque SANE Collaborative, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', ' Emergency Deprtment, UC Health Memorial Hospital, Colorado Springs, CO, United States.', ' Tulsa Forensic Nursing Services, Tulsa, OK, United States.', ' Austin SAFE, Austin, TX, United States.', ' Department of Emergency Medicine, Denver Health, Denver, CO, United States.', ' Crisis Center of Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', '0 Department of Emergency Medicine, Hennepin Healthcare, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', '1 Department of Emergency Medicine, Christiana Care, Newark, DE, United States.', '2 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States.', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio, TX, United States.', '4 Forensic Nursing, Cone Health, Greensboro, NC, United States.', '5 Department of Maternal and Child Health, Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, Texas A&M University, Bryan, TX, United States.', '7 Department of Psychiatry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, VA Atlanta Healthcare System, Atlanta, GA, United States.', '8 Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', '9 Departments of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Pediatrics, and Emergency Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI, United States.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pain""","""['Pain and somatic symptoms are sequelae of sexual assault: results of a prospective longitudinal study.', 'Health care utilization by women sexual assault survivors after emergency care: Results of a multisite prospective study.', 'Associations of Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Assault, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder With Menopause Symptoms Among Midlife and Older Women.', 'Acute severe pain is a common consequence of sexual assault.', 'ACOG Committee Opinion No. 777 Summary: Sexual Assault.']"""

Objective:   To assess the association of clinically used breast cancer markers with long-term survival and treatment benefit among postmenopausal women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive and ERBB2-negative breast cancer who received tamoxifen therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study was a secondary analysis of data from a subset of 565 women with ER-positive/ERBB2-negative breast cancer who participated in the Stockholm tamoxifen (STO-3) randomized clinical trial. The STO-3 clinical trial was conducted from 1976 to 1990 and comprised 1780 postmenopausal women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were randomized to receive adjuvant tamoxifen therapy or no endocrine therapy. Complete 25-year follow-up data through December 31, 2016, were obtained from Swedish national registers. Immunohistochemical markers were reannotated in 2014. Data were analyzed from April to December 2020.  Interventions:   Patients in the original STO-3 clinical trial were randomized to receive 2 years of tamoxifen therapy vs no endocrine therapy. In 1983, patients who received tamoxifen therapy without cancer recurrence during the 2-year treatment and who consented to continued participation in the STO-3 study were further randomized to receive 3 additional years of tamoxifen therapy or no endocrine therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) by clinically used breast cancer markers was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses adjusted for age, period of primary diagnosis, tumor size (T1a and T1b [T1a/b], T1c, and T2), tumor grade (1-3), PR status (positive vs negative), Ki-67 status (low vs medium to high), and STO-3 clinical trial arm (tamoxifen treatment vs no adjuvant treatment). A recursive partitioning analysis was performed to evaluate which markers were able to best estimate long-term DRFI.  Results:   The study population comprised 565 postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age, 62.0 [5.3] years) with lymph node-negative, ER-positive/ERBB2-negative breast cancer. A statistically significant difference in long-term DRFI was observed by tumor size (88% for T1a/b vs 76% for T1c vs 63% for T2 tumors; log-rank P < .001) and tumor grade (81% for grade 1 vs 77% for grade 2 vs 65% for grade 3 tumors; log-rank P = .02) but not by PR status or Ki-67 status. Patients with smaller tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31 [95% CI, 0.17-0.55] for T1a/b tumors and 0.58 [95% CI, 0.38-0.88] for T1c tumors) and grade 1 tumors (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.95) experienced a significant reduction in the long-term risk of distant recurrence compared with patients with larger (T2) tumors and grade 3 tumors, respectively. A significant tamoxifen treatment benefit was observed among patients with larger tumors (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32-0.89] for T1c tumors and 0.34 [95% CI, 0.16-0.73] for T2 tumors), lower tumor grades (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07-0.82] for grade 1 tumors and 0.50 [95% CI, 0.31-0.80] for grade 2 tumors), and PR-positive status (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.62). The recursive partitioning analysis revealed that tumor size was the most important characteristic associated with long-term survival, followed by clinical trial arm among patients with larger tumors.  Conclusions and relevance:   This secondary analysis of data from the STO-3 clinical trial indicated that, among the selected subgroup of patients, tumor size followed by tumor grade were the markers most significantly associated with long-term survival. Furthermore, a significant long-term tamoxifen treatment benefit was observed among patients with larger tumors, lower tumor grades, and PR-positive tumors.""","""['Huma Dar', 'Annelie Johansson', 'Anna Nordenskjöld', 'Adina Iftimi', 'Christina Yau', 'Gizeh Perez-Tenorio', 'Christopher Benz', 'Bo Nordenskjöld', 'Olle Stål', 'Laura J Esserman', 'Tommy Fornander', 'Linda S Lindström']""","""[' Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', ' Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ' Department of Medicine, Southern Älvsborg Hospital, Borås, Sweden.', ' Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', ' Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.', ' Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.', ' Department of Oncology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.', ' Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Molecular Genetic Characterization of a Subset of Women With Early Breast Cancer Followed Up for 25 Years in the Stockholm Tamoxifen Clinical Trial.', 'Assessment of Long-term Distant Recurrence-Free Survival Associated With Tamoxifen Therapy in Postmenopausal Patients With Luminal A or Luminal B Breast Cancer.', 'Use of Molecular Tools to Identify Patients With Indolent Breast Cancers With Ultralow Risk Over 2 Decades.', 'Randomized trial of two versus five years of adjuvant tamoxifen for postmenopausal early stage breast cancer.

Maximizing screening efficacy while minimizing overtreatment is vital, especially when considering how the HPV vaccine will affect the interpretation of results.  Objectives:   To estimate the likely outcomes of different screening modalities and to model how the increasing uptake of the HPV vaccine could affect the interpretation of screening results.  Design, setting, and participants:   This decision analytic model established a simple Markov model to compare the outcomes of different cervical cancer screening modalities on a simulated population of women (aged ≥25 years), considering different levels of HPV vaccination.  Main outcomes and measures:   The number of cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 and 3 detected and missed, the number of false positives, and the number of tests required to achieve a given level of accuracy. Positive and negative predictive values of different modalities were simulated under varying levels of HPV vaccination and therefore HPV prevalence.  Results:   In a simulated population of 1000 women aged 25 years and older with an HPV prevalence of 2%, HPV-based modalities outperformed LBC-based approaches, detecting 19% more true positives (HPV test sensitivity, 89.9% [95% CI, 88.6%-91.1%]; LBC test sensitivity, 75.5% [95% CI, 66.6%-82.7%]). While cotesting markedly reduced missed cases, detecting 29% more true positives than LBC alone (19.5 [95% CI, 19.3-19.7] per 1000 women screened vs 15.1 [95% CI, 13.3-16.5] per 1000 women screened), it unacceptably increased excess colposcopy referral by 94% (184.4 [95% CI, 181.8-188.0] false positives per 1000 women screened vs 95.1 [95% CI, 93.1-97.0] false positives per 1000 women screened). By contrast, triage testing with reflex screening substantially reduced false positives by a factor of approximately 10 (eg, HPV with LBC triage, 9.6 [95% CI, 9.3-10.0] per 1000 women screened). Over a lifetime of screening, reflex approaches with appropriate test intervals maximized therapeutic efficacy; as HPV vaccination rates increased, HPV-based screening approaches resulted in fewer unnecessary colposcopies than LBC approaches (HPV testing, 80% vaccine coverage: 44.1 [95% CI, 40-45.9] excess colposcopies; LBC testing, 80% vaccine coverage: 96.9 [95% CI, 96.8-97.0] excess colposcopies).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this decision analytic model, the effectiveness of cervical cancer screening was dependent on the prevalence of cervical dysplasia and/or HPV infection or vaccination in a population as well as the sensitivity and specificity of various modalities. Although screening is lifesaving, overtesting or modalities inappropriate to the target population may cause significant harm, including overtreatment.""","""['David Robert Grimes', 'Edward M A Corry', 'Talía Malagón', ""Ciaran O'Riain"", 'Eduardo L Franco', 'Donal J Brennan']""","""[' School of Physical Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland.', ' Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', ' Division of Cancer Epidemiology, Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', "" Department of Histopathology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", ' Systems Biology Ireland, University College Dublin School of Medicine, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Cervical screening with primary HPV testing or cytology in a population of women in which those aged 33 years or younger had previously been offered HPV vaccination: Results of the Compass pilot randomised trial.', 'Comparison of HPV-16 and HPV-18 Genotyping and Cytological Testing as Triage Testing Within Human Papillomavirus-Based Screening in Mexico.', 'The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary human papillomavirus cervical screening in England: extended follow-up of the ARTISTIC randomised trial cohort through three screening rounds.', 'Cytology versus HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in the general population.', 'A study of cervical cancer screening algorithms.', 'Provider beliefs in effectiveness and recommendations for primary HPV testing in\xa03 health-care systems.', 'The ellipse of insignificance, a refined fragility index for ascertaining robustness of results in dichotomous outcome trials.', 'Shifting from cytology to HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in Canada.']"""

Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan).

Clarithromycin is frequently prescribed in cases of suspected β-lactam hypersensitivity. Oral provocation tests stand as the gold standard to confirm drug hypersensitivity as diagnostic value of skin tests is variable. We analyzed the frequency of true clarithromycin hypersensitivity ratio and its relationship with β-lactam allergy among children with suspected clarithromycin hypersensitivity and evaluated the diagnostic value of skin tests.  Methods:   The study included 160 children referred with suspected clarithromycin hypersensitivity. Clinical history and allergy workups including skin tests or/and oral provocation tests were retrieved from medical records.  Results:   Oral provocation test confirmed clarithromycin hypersensitivity rate was 5.6% (n = 9/160). Skin tests with clarithromycin showed positivity in 32.6% (n = 29/89) of the tested patients. The sensitivity of clarithromycin skin tests was negligible, and specificity was 73.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.7-81.8). Eighty-eight of the patients (55%) reported that they had previously tolerated a β-lactam antibiotic. β-lactam hypersensitivity was suspected in 40% (n = 64/160) of the patients (simultaneous [n = 10], sequential [n = 19], distant form [n = 35]) in relation with clarithromycin usage. β-lactam hypersensitivity (95% CI, 2.1-70.6, p = .005) and sequential usage of clarithromycin after the development of a rash with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (95% CI, 2.0-96.4, p = .007) were found as risk factors for confirmed clarithromycin hypersensitivity.  Conclusion:   The frequency of confirmed clarithromycin hypersensitivity was found low among suspected patients. Oral provocation test is crucial for definite diagnosis. Confirmed β-lactam allergy may be attributed as a risk factor for clarithromycin hypersensitivity, particularly clarithromycin treatment after a developing rash with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in sequential usage.""","""['Ayse Suleyman', 'Esra Yucel', 'Sevgi Sipahi Cimen', 'Zeynep Hizli Demirkale', 'Cevdet Ozdemir', 'Zeynep Ulker Tamay', 'Nermin Guler']""","""[' Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', ' Department of Pediatric Basic Sciences, Institute of Child Health, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Pediatr Allergy Immunol""","""['Allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics in children.', 'Skin testing with β-lactam antibiotics for diagnosis of β-lactam hypersensitivity in children.', 'Direct oral provocation tests in non-immediate mild cutaneous reactions related to beta-lactam antibiotics.', 'Oral challenge without skin tests in children with non-severe beta-lactam hypersensitivity: Time to change the paradigm?', 'The controversy of drug hypersensitivity in patients with cystic fibrosis and review of the literature.']"""

Objective:   To develop a consistent BPD prevention bundle in a systematic approach to decrease BPD.  Design, setting, and participants:   This quality improvement study included 484 infants with birth weights from 501 to 1500 g admitted to a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system from 2009 through 2019. The study period was divided into 3 periods: 1, baseline (2009); 2, initial changes based on ongoing cycles of Plan-Do-Study-Act (2010-2014); and 3, full implementation of successive Plan-Do-Study-Act results (2015-2019).  Interventions:   A BPD prevention system of care bundle evolved with a shared mental model that BPD is avoidable.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was BPD in infants with less than 33 weeks' gestational age (hereafter referred to as BPD <33). Other measures included adjusted BPD <33, BPD severity grade, and adjusted median postmenstrual age (PMA) at hospital discharge. Balancing measures were adjusted mortality and adjusted mortality or specified morbidities.  Results:   The study population included 484 infants with a mean (SD) birth weight of 1070 (277) g; a mean (SD) gestational age of 28.6 (2.9) weeks; 252 female infants (52.1%); and 61 Black infants (12.6%). During the 3 study periods, BPD <33 decreased from 9 of 29 patients (31.0%) to 3 of 184 patients (1.6%) (P < .001 for trend); special cause variation was observed. The standardized morbidity ratio for the adjusted BPD <33 decreased from 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-1.9) in 2009 to 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) in 2019.

Although DNA repair variations are increasingly used for therapy selection in ovarian cancer, molecular features are not widely used for general assessment of patient prognosis and disease severity.  Objective:   To distill a highly dynamic characteristic, signature of copy number variations (CNV), into a risk score that could be easily validated analytically or repurposed for use given existing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved multigene assays.  Design, setting, and participants:   This genetic association study used the Cancer Genome Atlas Ovarian Cancer database to assess for genome-wide survival associations agnostic to gene function. Regions enriched for significant associations were compared to associations from scrambled data. CNV associations were condensed into a risk score, which was internally validated using bootstrapping. The participants were patients with serous ovarian cancer (stages I-IV) diagnosed from 1992 to 2013. Statistical analysis was performed from April to July 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival (OS).  Results:   Among 564 patients with serous ovarian cancer, the mean (SD) age was 59.7 (11.5) years; 34 (6%) identified as Black or African American. A total of 13 genome regions, comprising 14 alterations, were identified as significantly risk associated. Composite risk score was independent of total CNV burden, total mutational burden, BRCA status, and open-source genome-wide DNA repair deficiency signatures. Binned terciles yielded high-, standard-, and low-risk groups with respective median OS estimates of 2.9 (95% CI, 2.3-3.2) years, 4.1 (95% CI, 3.7-4.8) years, and 5.7 (95% CI, 4.7-7.4) years, respectively (P < .001). Associated 5-year survival estimates in each tercile were 15% (95% CI, 10%-22%), 36% (95% CI, 29%-46%), and 53% (95% CI, 45%-62%). The risk score had more discriminatory ability to prognosticate OS than age, clinical stage, grade, and race combined, and was strongly additive to significant clinical features (P < .001). Simulated adaptation of FDA-approved assays showed similar performance. Gene ontology analyses of identified regions showed an enrichment for regulatory miRNAs and protein kinase regulators.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that a CNV-based risk score is independent to and stronger than current or near-future ovarian cancer genomic biomarkers to prognosticate OS. CNV regions identified were not strongly associated with canonical ovarian cancer biological pathways, identifying candidates for future mechanistic investigations. External validation of the CNV risk score, especially in concert with more extensive clinical features, could be pursued via existing FDA-approved assays.""","""['Ryon P Graf', 'Ramez Eskander', 'Leo Brueggeman', 'Dwayne G Stupack']""","""[' Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego.', ' Now at Foundation Medicine Inc, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', ' Interdisciplinary Genetics Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City.', ' Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Errors in Figure Captions.', 'Genome wide DNA copy number analysis of serous type ovarian carcinomas identifies genetic markers predictive of clinical outcome.', 'A DNA repair pathway-focused score for prediction of outcomes in ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.', 'Identification three LncRNA prognostic signature of ovarian cancer based on genome-wide copy number variation.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'The Landscape of Whole-genome Alterations and Pathologic Features in Genitourinary Malignancies: An Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas.', 'Can circulating cell free DNA be a promising marker in ovarian cancer? - a genome-scale profiling study in a single institution.', 'Pathway-level mutation analysis in primary high-grade serous ovarian cancer and matched brain metastases.', 'Spontaneous Transformation of a p53 and Rb-Defective Human Fallopian Tube Epithelial Cell Line after Long Passage with Features of High-Grade Serous Carcinoma.', 'Identification of Malignant Cell Populations Associated with Poor Prognosis in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.', 'Identification of the Immune Signatures for Ovarian Cancer Based on the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Genes.']"""

Differences between SGA-treated, SGA-naive, and control children were assessed by linear and log-linear regression models.  Results:   SGA-treated children had greater BMI z-scores and overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age and sex) and hypertension than SGA-naive and control children.

Methods:   Thirty-one children (19 males) with pediatric arterial ischemic stroke, participating in a larger prospective, longitudinal study, were recruited to this study at 5 years poststroke. Parent- and self-rated PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale scores were compared with published normative data. Associations between parent-rated PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, demographics, stroke characteristics, and concurrent outcomes were examined.  Results:   Parent-rated total, general and cognitive fatigue were significantly poorer than population norms, with more than half of all parents reporting fatigue symptoms in their children. One-third of children also reported experiencing fatigue symptoms, but their ratings did not differ significantly from normative expectations, as such, all further analyses were on parent ratings of fatigue. Older age at stroke and larger lesion size predicted greater general fatigue; older age, female sex, and higher social risk predicted more sleep/rest fatigue. No significant predictors of cognitive fatigue were identified and only older age at stroke predicted total fatigue. Greater fatigue was associated with poorer adaptive functioning, motor skills, participation, quality of life, and behavior problems but not attention.

Methods:   We included 12,320 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants (aged 54.3 ± 5.7 years) free of a history of PAD at baseline (visit 1: 1987-1989). The TyG index was determined using ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL] × fasting glucose [mg/dL]/2), and measured at 5 visits between 1987 and 2013. Incident PAD was defined as the first hospitalization with PAD diagnosis or a new onset of measured ABI < 0.90 during follow-up visits. We quantified the association of both baseline and trajectories of TyG index with incident PAD using Cox regression and logistic regression analysis, respectively.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 23 years, 1300 participants developed PAD. After adjustment for traditional PAD risk factors, each 1-SD (0.58) increase in TyG index was associated with an 11.9% higher risk of incident PAD [hazard ratio, 1.119 (95% CI, 1.049-1.195)]. Results were similar when individuals were categorized by TyG index quartiles [hazard ratio, 1.239 (95% CI, 1.028-1.492); comparing extreme quartiles]. Four distinct trajectories of stable TyG indexes at various levels along the follow-up duration were identified [low (22.2%), moderate (43.2%), high (27.5%), and very high (7.1%) trajectory groups]. Compared with those with a TyG index trajectory at a low level, those participants with TyG index trajectories at high and very high levels had an even greater risk of future incident PAD [odds ratio (95%CI): 1.404 (1.132-1.740) and 1.742 (1.294-2.344), respectively] after multivariate adjustments for traditional PAD risk factors.  Conclusions:   Higher TyG index is independently associated with an increased risk of incident PAD.

Germline pathogenic variants in IKZF1 have been reported in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and immunodeficiency syndromes. Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by erythroid hypoplasia, associated with a spectrum of congenital anomalies and an elevated risk of certain cancers. DBA is usually caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes that function in ribosomal biogenesis; however, in many cases the genetic etiology is unknown. We identified a germline IKZF1 variant, rs757907717 C > T, in identical twins with DBA-like features and autoimmune gastrointestinal disease. rs757907717 C > T results in a p.R381C amino acid change in the IKZF1 Ik-x isoform (p.R423C on isoform Ik-1), which we show is associated with altered global gene expression and perturbation of transcriptional networks involved in hematopoietic system development.

Methods:   HDV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection was examined using an anti-HDV antibody in Yonghe Cardinal Tien Hospital (YCTH), a district hospital in Taiwan. Clinical characteristics of anti-HDV-positive and anti-HDV-negative patients were collected and compared. These characteristics were also compared with the data collected from a medical center. Continuous variables and confounding factor adjustments were compared using the analysis of covariance method, whereas categorical variables were compared using the logistic regression method.  Results:   A total of 346 patients with chronic HBV infection were assessed from 2018 to 2019. Among them, 4 (1.15%) were positive for anti-HDV. The clinical, virological, and biochemical characteristics were similar between anti-HDV-positive and anti-HDV-negative groups. None of the four patients was positive for serum HDV RNA. Another 18 anti-HDV-positive patients were identified from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The clinical, virological, and biochemical characteristics of anti-HDV-positive patients from YCTH and NTUH were also similar.  Conclusion:   The prevalence of HDV and the serum HDV RNA-positive rate were low in district hospitals in Taiwan. Coexisting HDV infection did not influence the clinical manifestation of patients with chronic HBV infection in Taiwan. However, because the number of HDV RNA cases was very small, our findings may not be conclusive. Besides, since the sensitivity of current anti-HDV kit is not 100%, more sensitive methods are needed to achieve reliable prevalence data.""","""['Wei-Cheng Lee', 'Tzen-Kwan Chen', 'Hwa-Fa Han', 'Yu-Chun Lin', 'Ya-Min Hwang', 'Jia-Horng Kao', 'Pei-Jer Chen', 'Chun-Jen Liu']""","""[' Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonghe Cardinal Tien Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonghe Cardinal Tien Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine and Hepatitis Research Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine and Hepatitis Research Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

However, associations between cannabis use and suicidality among young adults are poorly understood.  Objective:   To determine whether cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are associated with a higher prevalence of suicidality among young adults with or without depression and to assess whether these associations vary by sex.  Design, setting, and participants:   This survey study examined data from 281 650 adults aged 18 to 34 years who participated in the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Data were collected from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019.  Exposures:   Prevalence of past-year daily or near-daily cannabis use (≥300 days in the past year), CUD, and major depressive episode (MDE). Past-year CUD and MDE were based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.  Main outcomes and measures:   Past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt.  Results:   Among the 281 650 adults aged 18 to 34 (men, 49.9% [95% CI, 49.6%-50.2%]; women, 50.1% [95% CI, 49.8%-50.4%]) included in the analysis, past-year suicidal ideation and plan along with daily cannabis use increased among all examined sociodemographic subgroups (except daily cannabis use among current high-school students), and past-year suicide attempt increased among most subgroups. National trends in adjusted prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt varied by daily and nondaily cannabis use and CUD among adults with or without MDE. After controlling for MDE, CUD, cannabis use status, and potential confounding factors, the adjusted prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt increased 1.4 to 1.6 times from the 2008-2009 to 2018-2019 periods (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] for suicidal ideation, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]; ARR for suicide plan, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5-1.9]; ARR for suicide attempt, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.7]), with 2008 to 2009 as the reference period. Past-year CUD, daily cannabis use, and nondaily cannabis use were associated with a higher prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt in both sexes (eg, among individuals without MDE, prevalence of suicidal ideation for those with vs without CUD was 13.9% vs 3.5% among women and 9.9% vs 3.0% among men; P < .001), but significantly more so in women than men (eg, suicide plan among those with CUD and MDE was 52% higher for women [23.7%] than men [15.6%]; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   From 2008 to 2019, suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt increased 40% to 60% over increases ascribed to cannabis use and MDE. Future research is needed to examine this increase in suicidality and to determine whether it is due to cannabis use or overlapping risk factors.""","""['Beth Han', 'Wilson M Compton', 'Emily B Einstein', 'Nora D Volkow']""","""[' National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Prevalence and correlates of past 12-month suicide attempt among adults with past-year suicidal ideation in the United States.', 'Demographic risk factors for co-occurring suicidality and cannabis use disorders: Findings from a nationally representative United States sample.', 'National Trends in the Prevalence of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Among Young Adults and Receipt of Mental Health Care Among Suicidal Young Adults.', 'Cannabis smoking increases the risk of suicide ideation and suicide attempt in young individuals of 11-21 years: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of suicidality in autistic and possibly autistic people without co-occurring intellectual disability.', 'Exogenous Cannabinoids Impair Effort-Related Decision-Making via Affecting Neural Synchronization between the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Nucleus Accumbens.', 'US trends in the association of suicide ideation/behaviors with marijuana use among adolescents ages 12-17 and differences by gender and race/ethnicity.', 'Suicidal ideation among Canadian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of psychosocial factors and substance use behaviours.', 'Early Age of Cannabis Initiation and Its Association With Suicidal Behaviors.', 'Syndemic relationship of depressive symptoms, substance use, and suicidality in transgender youth: a cross-sectional study using the U.S. youth risk behavior surveillance system.']"""

This project aimed to estimate changes in the rates of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in Iceland between 1997 and 2018, and to assess whether the changes can be explained by an increased rate of labor induction.  Methods:   Singleton live births, occurring between 1997 and 2018, that did not start by prelabor cesarean, were identified from the Icelandic Medical Birth Register (n = 85 971). Rates of intrapartum cesarean birth (CB), obstetric emergencies, and neonatal outcomes were calculated, and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with log-binomial regression (reference: 1997-2001). Adjustments were made for: (a) maternal characteristics, and (b) labor induction and gestational age.  Results:   The rate of labor induction increased from 13.6% in the period 1997-2001 to 28.1% in the period 2014-2018. The rate of intrapartum CB decreased between the periods of 1997-2001 and 2014-2018 for both primiparous (aRR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.84) and multiparous women (aRR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.63). The rate of obstetric emergencies and adverse neonatal outcomes also decreased between these time periods. Adjusting for labor induction did not attenuate these associations.

Aims and methods:   Secondary analyses of 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Surveys were undertaken (pooled n = 49 395). Frequency analyses informed subsequent modeling of select industries and occupations. Four logistic regression models estimated adjusted effects of demographics on daily smoking in industries with high (≥20%) and low (≤15%) daily smoking prevalence and occupations with high (≥20%) and low-moderate (<20%) daily smoking prevalence.  Results:   The sample comprised 55.7% men, 34.1% 25-39-year-olds, 31.4% New South Wales residents, 70.1% metropolitan residents, 66.9% high socioeconomic status workers, and 70.6% with low psychological distress. Daily smoking prevalence differed by industry and occupation in 2007, generally decreasing between 2007 and 2016. In high prevalence industries, daily smoking was associated with male gender and age (25-39-year-olds) and in low prevalence industries with males and nonmetropolitan workers. In high prevalence occupations, daily smoking was associated with males, female nonmetropolitan workers, and age 25-39 years and in low-moderate prevalence occupations with nonmetropolitan workers and negatively associated with females aged 14-24 years. In all models, increased odds of daily smoking were associated with low socioeconomic status and very high psychological distress.  Conclusions:   Low socioeconomic status and very high psychological distress were risk factors for daily smoking regardless of industry, occupation, or high preexisting smoking prevalence. Targeted, as well as universal, interventions are required for workplaces and workers with greatest smoking vulnerability and least smoking cessation progress.  Implications:   Specific strategies are warranted for identified industries, occupations, and subgroups with increased odds of daily tobacco smoking. Industries and occupations with low-moderate smoking prevalence may confer workers some protection but are not without risk; some subgroups in these settings (eg, nonmetropolitan areas) had elevated daily smoking risk. Hence, the following are supported: (1) universal interventions directed at low socioeconomic workers and workers with very high psychological distress regardless of workplace; (2) interventions targeted at high prevalence industries; (3) cessation efforts targeted for young workers in high prevalence industries and occupations; and (4) focused interventions addressing specific needs of nonmetropolitan at-risk workers in low prevalence industries.""","""['Alice McEntee', 'Susan Kim', 'Nathan Harrison', 'Janine Chapman', 'Ann Roche']""","""[' National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction, Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Nicotine Tob Res""","""['Changing patterns and prevalence of daily tobacco smoking among Australian workers: 2007-2016.', 'Cigarette Smoking Among Working Women of Reproductive Age-United States, 2009-2013.', 'The Prevalence of Exposure to Workplace Secondhand Smoke in the United States: 2010 to 2015.', 'Prevalence and workplace correlates of tobacco smoking among male expatriate workers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Estimates of the Prevalence, Intensity and the Number of Workers Exposed to Cigarette Smoking across Occupations and Industries in Korea.', 'Estimating 10-year risk of lung and breast cancer by occupation in Switzerland.', 'Recovery Experiences Protect Emotionally Exhausted White-Collar Workers from Gaming Addiction.']"""

Although the pathophysiology of Susac syndrome is not yet fully elucidated, recent advances favour a primitive vasculitis affecting the cerebral, retinal and cochlear small vessels. Susac syndrome must be recognized in the presence of the pathognomonic clinical triad associating: 1/subacute encephalopathy with unusual headache and pseudopsychiatric features associated with diffuse white matter, grey matter nuclei and specifically corpus callosum lesions on brain MRI; 2/eye involvement that may be pauci-symptomatic, with occlusions of the branches of the central artery of the retina at fundoscopy and arterial wall hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography; and 3/cochleo-vestibular damage with hearing loss predominating at low frequencies on the audiogram. Relapses are frequent during an active period lasting approximately 2 years. Eventually, the disease resolves but isolated retinal arterial wall hyperfluorescence without new occlusions may recur, which should not lead to treatment intensification. First-line treatment consists of a combination of anti-aggregants and high dose corticosteroids. In refractory patients or in case of relapse, immunomodulatory molecules such as intravenous immunoglobulins or immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide or rituximab should be started.

Method: To answer this question empirically, we asked 503 parents (mean age: 47.63 years) to rate their 503 children (average age: 14.60 years) regarding QoL and PG, using validated questionnaires on parental assessments of adolescent PG and health-related QoL to collect the data. Correlation analyses were calculated to determine bivariate relations, and a multiple linear regression was used to conduct a multivariable analysis. Results: In the bivariate analyses, a higher severity of PG was associated with a lower health-related QoL in all five surveyed dimensions. In the multivariable model (corrected R2 = 0.35), we observed statistically significant associations between higher severity of PG and male sex and lower age of the adolescent as well as lower QoL in the dimensions of physical well-being and school environment.

We hypothesized that XO is expressed in carotid plaque from symptomatic patients in association with cardiovascular risk factors.  Methods:   Patients were stratified by symptoms, defined as presentation with an ipsilateral cerebral ischemic event. Carotid atherosclerotic plaques were obtained from 44 patients with symptomatic plaque and 44 patients without ischemic cerebral events. Protein expression of XO was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and the percentage of cells expressing XO and CD68 (macrophage marker) compared between the groups. Biochemical and demographic cardiometabolic risk factors of study participants also were measured.  Results:   Carotid atherosclerotic plaques from symptomatic patients were associated with significantly higher XO expression versus asymptomatic plaque (median [interquartile range]: 1.24 [2.09] versus 0.16 [0.34]; P<0.001) and with significantly higher circulating uric acid levels (mean±SD: 7.36±2.10 versus 5.37±1.79 mg/dL; P<0.001, respectively). In addition, XO expression in atherosclerotic carotid plaque was inversely associated with serum high-density lipoproteins cholesterol levels (P=0.010, r=−0.30) and directly with circulating uric acid levels (P<0.001, r=0.45). The average percentage of macrophages that expressed XO was significantly higher in symptomatic versus asymptomatic plaques (median [interquartile range]: 93.37% [25] versus 46.15% [21], respectively; P<0.001).  Conclusions:   XO overexpression in macrophages is associated with increased serum uric acid and low high-density lipoproteins cholesterol levels and may potentially have a mechanistic role in carotid plaque destabilization.

Methodology:   Granulomatous lesions suggestive of TB obtained from 109 buffaloes (n =109) during sanitary inspection at slaughter were subjected to histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of Mycobacterium antigens, and to molecular tests (PCR) to detect hsp65, IS6110 and RD4 genes, which are specific to Mycobacterium spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) and M. bovis, respectively.  Results:   PCR results indicated Mycobacterium infection in 87.2% of the cases, of which 69.5% were positive for M. bovis, 27.4% belonged to MTBC, and 3.1% were probably non-TB mycobacteria. There was good agreement between the genus-specific molecular technique and the histopathological analysis.

Their burden and genetic diversity vary from one region to another and little is known in Northern African regions. This study describes epidemiological patterns and genotypic diversity of HRV in SARI cases during a two and half year's study, in Northern Tunisia.  Methodology:   A total of 271 SARI cases, admitted into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Bechir Hamza Children's Hospital in Tunis, were collected between September 2015 and December 2017. The investigation concerned 104 samples positive for HRV and/or HEV (Human Enterovirus) obtained among these cases. Specific HRV and HEV detections were assessed by real-time PCRs. The HRV molecular typing was based on the VP4-VP2 genomic region analyses.  Results:   Among the viral SARI cases, 33.5% and 12.3% were positive for HRV and HEV respectively. Molecular investigations showed high prevalence of HRV-A (63.3%) followed by HRV-C (30.6%) and HRV-B (6.1%) and high genotypic diversity with 27 types. HRV cases were mostly detected in toddlers younger than 6 months. A total of 16 cases (28%) were found with bacterial and/or viral co-infection.

Methodology:   A total of 170 stool samples were collected from these patients and microsporidia species was detected using a Real-Time PCR targeting a conserved region of the small ribosomal subunit rRNA (SSU-rRNA) gene of Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi.  Results:   Fifty six (32.9%) were positive for microsporidia. The prevalence was higher in HIV negative patients (36.6%) while 24.1% of patients who were HIV positive had microsporidia. Microsporidia was more common among patients aged between 1 and 10 years (52.6%). However among the HIV positive patients, microsporidia prevalence was higher among those that were not taking antiretrovirals (ARVs) compared to those who were on ARVs, (36.6%) and (24.1%), respectively. Microsporidia was also noted to be significantly associated with diarrheal and stomach pains; p = 0.02 and p = 0.048, respectively. Furthermore, microsporidia infections was more prevalent among patients who had animals at home (p = 0.037).  Conclusions:   Study has shown a high prevalence of microsporidia among patients attending primary health centers in the Mopani District for the first time. Prevalence of microsporidia was higher among HIV negative and HIV positive patients who were not on ARV treatment. Keeping animals in the household appeared to be a risk of getting infected with microsporidia.

Optochin resistance has been a potential cause of misidentification of pneumococcus and other members of the mitis group. Hence, rapid and easy optochin resistant (Optr) S. pneumoniae identification is essential.  Methodology:   Atypical pneumococci were characterized using optochin susceptibility, bile solubility based on spectrophotometric reading, serotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 16S rRNA sequencing and PCR-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lytA, ply, pspA, cpsA, Spn9802 and Spn9828.  Results:   Optical density values for the bile solubility test suggest the identification of four Optr S. pneumoniae and one Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. All Optr pneumococci harbored cpsA, lytA, ply, Spn9802, Spn9828 and pspA genes. Only ply, spn9802 and Spn9828 genes were detected in S. pseudopneumoniae. The 16S rRNA sequencing differentiates between these two species. Optr S. pneumoniae strains belonged to different genotypes and serotypes (14, 19A, 3 and 9V). Three Optr S. pneumoniae isolates were typed as pspA family 2, while one belonged to pspA family 1. Sequencing of the atpA and atpC gene of the Optr variants revealed three mutations in the ATPase a-subunit (L99I, M23V and V52I) and one mutation in ATPase c-subunit (V48I).  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that bile OD-values provides an accurate, fast and easy method to discriminate between Optr S. pneumoniae and other Streptococcus mitis group. Moreover molecular techniques, confirming the bile test, can be used in order to prevent these atypical pneumococci and alert clinical microbiologists of the presence of these strains in the community.""","""['Sonia Ktari', 'Nour El Houda Ben Ayed', 'Sonda Maalej', 'Basma Mnif', 'Faouzia Rhimi', 'Adnene Hammami']""","""[' Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School of Sfax, Tunisia. sonia_ktari2002@yahoo.fr.', ' Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""J Infect Dev Ctries""","""['Disease isolates of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable S. pneumoniae presumptively identified as atypical S. pneumoniae in Spain.', 'Genotypic identification of presumptive Streptococcus pneumoniae by PCR using four genes highly specific for S. pneumoniae.', 'Characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.', 'Relationships among streptococci from the mitis group, misidentified as Streptococcus pneumoniae.', 'Assessment of the Optochin Susceptibility Test to Differentiate Streptococcus pneumoniae from other Viridans Group Streptococci.', 'Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae as an emerging respiratory tract pathogen at Assiut University hospitals.']"""

The aim of this study was to reveal the incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 strains among the intensive care unit patients in a university hospital in Istanbul.  Methodology:   Consecutive nonreplicated 83 K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from various clinical samples of intensive care unit patients admitted to a university hospital in Istanbul, between November 2016 to December 2018. Bacterial identifications were performed via VITEK2. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted with Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion test except for colistin which was performed with broth microdilution. Real-time PCR method was utilized in order to reveal ST258 positivity among the strains.  Results:   Antimicrobial susceptibility results revealed that 56 (67%) K. pneumoniae strains were carbapenem-resistant. Real-time PCR results demonstrated that 15 out of 83 (18%) K.pneumoniae strain were ST258. According to antimicrobial susceptibility test results of ST258 strains, 8 were found as carbapenem-resistant whereas 7 were found as carbapenem susceptible. 3 out of 8 (37.5%) carbapenem-resistant ST258 strains were found as resistant against all antibiotics tested.  Conclusions:   Our study revealed that K. pneumoniae ST258 which caused severe infections worldwide so far has also spread to Istanbul.

Objective:   To test an automated behavioral intervention to prevent weight gain and improve diet using employee cafeteria purchasing data.  Design, setting, and participants:   This individual-level randomized clinical trial of a 12-month intervention with 12 months of follow-up was conducted among employees of a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who purchased food at on-site cafeterias that used traffic-light labels (ie, green indicates healthy; yellow, less healthy; red, unhealthy). Participants were enrolled September 2016 to February 2018. Data were analyzed from May to September 2020.  Interventions:   For 12 months, participants in the intervention group received 2 emails per week with feedback on previous cafeteria purchases and personalized health and lifestyle tips and 1 letter per month with peer comparisons and financial incentives for healthier purchases. Emails and letters were automatically generated using survey, health, and cafeteria data. Control group participants received 1 letter per month with general healthy lifestyle information.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcome was change in weight from baseline to 12 months and 24 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in cafeteria purchases, including proportion of green- and red-labeled purchases and calories purchased per day, from baseline (12 months preintervention) to the intervention (months 1-12) and follow-up (months 13-24) periods. Baseline Healthy Eating Index-15 (HEI-15) scores were compared to HEI-15 scores at 6, 12, and 24 months.  Results:   Among 602 employees enrolled (mean [SD] age, 43.6 [12.2] years; 478 [79.4%] women), 299 were randomized to the intervention group and 303 were randomized to the control group. Baseline mean (SD) body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 28.3 (6.6) and HEI-15 score was 60.4 (12.4). There were no between-group differences in weight change at 12 (0.2 [95% CI, -0.6 to 1.0] kg) or 24 (0.6 [95% CI, -0.3 to 1.4] kg) months. Compared with baseline, the intervention group increased green-labeled purchases by 7.3% (95% CI, 5.4% to 9.3%) and decreased red-labeled purchases by 3.9% (95% CI, -5.0% to -2.7%) and calories purchased per day by 49.5 (95% CI, -75.2 to -23.9) kcal more than the control group during the intervention period. In the intervention group, differences in changes in green (4.8% [95% CI, 2.9% to 6.8%]) and red purchases (-3.1% [95% CI, -4.3% to -2.0%]) were sustained at the 24-month follow-up. Differences in changes in HEI-15 scores were not significantly different in the intervention compared with the control group at 6 (2.2 [95% CI, 0 to 4.4]), 12 (1.8 [95% CI, -0.6 to 4.1]), and 24 (1.6, 95% CI, -0.7 to 3.8]) months.

Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan.  Methods:   A nationwide survey was conducted following the ""Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)"". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (±264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (±11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (±49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (±31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (±25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (±44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (±9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (±42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy.  Discussion:   Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan.  Conclusion:   We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments.

We aim to evaluate the scientific production on OSA from 2009 to 2018 to illustrate its worldwide distribution, topic areas, and ability to secure funding, as well as to describe international collaboration networks in this field.  Methods:   Articles published between 2009 and 2018 were extracted from the Science Citation Index Expanded via Web of Science (WoS) using the search term ""obstructive sleep apn*"". Publication year, number and country of authors, journal, subject category, key words, funding source and number of citations received were recorded. We also conducted network analyses for key words and international collaboration.  Results:   12,666 articles on OSA were located, which had increased from 895 documents in 2009 to 1592 in 2018. The progressive growth in scientific production on OSA had outpaced the growth rate of total WoS production since 2012.50% of the articles declared some type of funding, with a citation index higher than manuscripts that were not funded. The manuscripts were distributed in journals from 135 subject categories of the WoS, and keyword distribution showed a dispersed pattern with a high number of nodes. The international collaboration rate was 18.2%, and the country network showed the United States as the hegemonic node.

To address this issue, we designed the project ""Backtoclinic"" with the purpose of identifying LTFU adult PKU patients in Austria as a first step to reestablish appropriate treatment.  Subjects and methods:   Individuals born between 1966 and 1999 and diagnosed with PKU through the National Austrian Newborn Screening Program (NANSP) were identified using the NANSP's database. Follow-up data were collected in the Austrian metabolic centers (Medical University of Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg). Patients with no contact to any of these centers within the previous two years were classified as LTFU. Epidemiological characteristics of the whole study population as well as of LTFU- and currently in follow-up patients were analyzed.  Results:   Between 1966 and 1999, 281 individuals were diagnosed with PKU through the NANSP. Two patients died in their first year of life and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 279 patients (mean age ± SD: 36.7 ± 9.1 y, 42.7% females), 177 (63.4%) are currently LTFU. The rate of LTFU patients is higher in men than in women (68.1% vs 57.5%), and markedly increases with age in both sexes. The gender gap is greatest in young adults (52.6% vs. 25.0% in the age range 20.0-24.9 y) and declines with age (94.4% vs. 80.0% in the age range > 45.0 y).  Conclusions:   We found an alarming rate of 63.4% of LTFU adult PKU patients in Austria, and observed a gender gap in the PKU state of care. Our findings illustrate the urgent need for the metabolic community to identify LTFU adult PKU patients and to develop strategies to reestablish appropriate treatment for men and women with PKU.""","""['Marianna Beghini', 'Felix J Resch', 'Dorothea Möslinger', 'Vassiliki Konstantopoulou', 'Daniela Karall', 'Sabine Scholl-Bürgi', 'Michaela Brunner-Krainz', 'Barbara Plecko', 'Johannes Spenger', 'Alexandra Kautzky-Willer', 'Thomas Scherer', 'Miriam Hufgard-Leitner']""","""[' Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Gürtel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

Community living and promiscuity are key factors in the direct or indirect transmission and spread of these diseases.  Objectives:   The objective was to study the epidemiological aspects of SFI, among koranic school children in two localities in Senegal.  Patients/methods:   School koranic students were recruited in Thies and Touba. Diagnosis of fungal diseases was carried out using conventional techniques (microscopic examination and culture).  Results:   Among 210 children, the overall prevalence of SFI was 25.71%, with 27.63% in Touba and 20.68% in Thiès. The clinical lesions were epidermophytosis (0.5%), intertrigo (0.9%), palmoplantar keratoderma (KPP) (0.9%), onychomycosis (7.7%) and tinea capitis (TC) (90%). The species responsible for the SFI were Trichophyton soudanense (85.18%), Microsporum audouinii langeronii (9.25%), Trichophyton rubrum (3.70%) and Chrysosporium keratinophilum (1.85%). The prevalence of infection was higher among boys (85.18%).

Methods:   CRP and BMI were collected from participants of the Raine Study Gen2 at 14-, 17-, 20- and 22-year follow-ups (n = 1312). A dual trajectory analysis was conducted to assess the association between CRP and BMI trajectories, providing conditional probabilities of membership of CRP trajectory membership given BMI trajectory membership. Best model fit was assessed by systematically fitting two to eight trajectory groups with linear and quadratic terms and comparing models according to the Bayesian Information Criterion statistic.  Results:   The three CRP trajectories were; ""stable-low"" (71.0%), ""low-to-high"" (13.8%) and ""stable-high"" (15.2%). Participants in a ""high-increasing"" BMI trajectory had a higher probability of being in the ""stable-high"" CRP trajectory (60.4% of participants). In contrast, individuals in the ""medium-increasing"" BMI trajectory did not have a significantly increased probability of being in the ""stable-high"" CRP trajectory.

Onychomycosis in psoriatic patients is more commonly caused by yeasts comparing with non-psoriatic.  Objectives:   Evaluate the prevalence of fungi in nail psoriasis. Evaluate the association between direct mycological examination (DME) and mycological culture, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) and systemic treatment for psoriasis.  Methods:   Of 133 nails from 20 patients with nail psoriasis were evaluated as follows: 9 patients were using topical treatment and 11 were on systemic treatment. The assessment of psoriasis severity using NAPSI was performed in all psoriatic nails. The presence of fungi was confirmed in DME and culture.  Results:   DME showed the presence of fungal elements in 45 nails (33.83%) with a predominance of blastoconidia (95.5%) No septate hyphae were seen. Mycological culture was positive in 36 (27.06%) samples. Among them, Candida grew in 31 (86.1%): Candida parapsilosis in 15 (48.38%), Candida spp in 14 (45.16%). No growth of dermatophytes was observed. Patients with systemic treatment showed a higher frequency of positive test (DME and culture) for fungi when compared to topic treatment (p:.006). There was a positive correlation between NAPSI, mycological culture and systemic treatment (p:.0063); the risk was four times higher (OR:4.0).  Limitation of the study:   Sample size.  Conclusion:   These results are consistent with some previous reports, Candida was the fungus with higher frequency on the psoriatic nails, however, the role of these fungi is controversial (contamination x colonisation x infection). The fact that the immunosuppressive treatment increases the chance of fungal infection leads us to a greater attention to this patient profile, to prevent the intensification of nail psoriasis (Köbner phenomenon).""","""['Rachel Grynszpan', 'Gloria Barreiros', 'Marilene do Nascimento Paixão', 'Mariana Frasnelli Fernandes', 'Felipe Aguinaga', 'Cláudia Camargo', 'Marcia Ramos-E-Silva', 'Sueli Carneiro']""","""[' Sector of Dermatology, Medical Clinics Post-Graduation Program, School of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', ' Medical Specialties Department, Post Graduation Course, Sector of Dermatology, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Mycoses""","""['Overall Prevalence and Prevalence Compared among Psoriasis Treatments of Onychomycosis in Patients with Nail Psoriasis and Fungal Involvement.', 'Factors affecting onychomycosis in patients with psoriasis.', 'The prevalence and etiological factors of onychomycosis in psoriatic patients.', 'Coexistence of Fungal Infections in Psoriatic Nails and their Correlation with Severity of Nail Psoriasis.', 'Onychomycosis in patients with psoriasis--a multicentre study.', 'Appraisal of selected ethnomedicinal plants as alternative therapies against onychomycosis: Evaluation of synergy and time-kill kinetics.']"""

Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks, and the results were used to tailor lifestyle coaching in the intervention group. At baseline, 12 and 24 weeks, composite risk scores (CRS) were calculated. A lower CRS corresponds to a healthier lifestyle.  Results:   Of the 400 women recruited, 262 women were randomized (131 in each arm). At 12 weeks, a reduction in CRS (includes risk score for intake of folic acid, vegetables and fruits, smoking and alcohol) was observed in the intervention versus control arms. After correcting for baseline, the difference in the CRS between intervention and control was -0.47 (95% CI -0.97 to 0.02) at 12 weeks and -0.32 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.15) at 24 weeks. A statistically significant reduction in lifestyle risk scores was found in women with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or above compared with those with a BMI below 25kg/m2. The odds of being pregnant at 24 weeks was increased in the intervention versus control (OR 2.83, 95% CI 0.35 to 57.76).

Design:   Initially, the organoids were established from acquired biopsies (women with and without endometriosis) and characterized by morphological, histological and immunostaining analyses.  Results:   A panel of endometriosis-related genes showed a pattern of expressions in cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and a contradictory expression pattern for cadherin (CDH1), POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1; also known as OCT4), and Nanog homeobox (NANOG) in the endometriosis organoids that is concordant with published research. These endometriosis organoids failed to upregulate 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (17HSDβ2), progestogen associated endometrial protein (PAEP), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in response to progesterone at the level observed in control endometrium organoids. Progesterone receptor B (PRB) gene expression significantly decreased in both eutopic and ectopic organoids compared with control endometrium organoids. DNA hypermethylation, as an epigenetic mechanism for suppression of transcription, was detected at the PRB promoter in the eutopic, but not ectopic, organoids. Therefore, other epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications and microRNAs, may be responsible for PRB downregulation in ectopic organoids.

We found significantly lower serum melatonin levels in gout patients in the acute phase than in those in the remission phase or in normal individuals. The mRNA expression of melatonin receptor 2 (MT2) was also lower in gout patients than in normal individuals. To verify the in-vivo role of melatonin, a gouty arthritis model was established by intraarticular injection of monosodium urate (MSU, 1 mg) crystals into the paws of C57BL/6 mice. Joint inflammation in the mouse model was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the right paw/left paw, and the inflammation index was determined by examining infiltrating neutrophils with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Melatonin was found to reduce both paw thickness and the inflammation index in the mouse model, and melatonin also reduced the mRNA levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6 and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. To mimic gouty inflammation in vitro, mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) plus MSU. Melatonin was revealed to reduce IL-1β secretion by stimulated macrophages. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were also inhibited by melatonin. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β was also inhibited by melatonin. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that melatonin alleviated gouty inflammation in vivo and in vitro, and the underlying mechanism may involve inhibiting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.""","""['Wen-Ze Xiao', 'Li Zhao', 'Lin Cao', 'Xiao-Xia Zhu', 'He-Jian Zou']""","""[' Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', ' Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Fudan University Pudong Medical Center, Shanghai, 201300, China.', ' Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China. hjzou@fudan.edu.cn.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Curr Med Sci""","""['Erratum to: Melatonin Alleviates Acute Gouty Inflammation In Vivo and In Vitro.', 'Curcumin ameliorates monosodium urate-induced gouty arthritis through Nod-like receptor 3 inflammasome mediation via inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B signaling.', 'Celastrol ameliorates Propionibacterium acnes/LPS-induced liver damage and MSU-induced gouty arthritis via inhibiting K63 deubiquitination of NLRP3.', 'Baeckein E suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation through inhibiting both the priming and assembly procedure: Implications for gout therapy.', 'Beneficial Properties of Phytochemicals on NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Gout and Complication.', 'Mechanisms of spontaneous resolution of acute gouty inflammation.', 'Psycho-Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology: A Role for Melatonin in This New Paradigm.']"""

High RDW is a novel risk marker, which has been associated with mortality and morbidity both from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, but the association between RDW and measures of lung function in the general population remains unclear.  Methods:   The associations of RDW with spirometry, diffusing capacity (DLCO) and impulse oscillometry (IOS) were investigated among 5767, 5496 and 5598 subjects (aged 50-64 years), respectively, from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS). Multiple linear regression and general linear models were performed to examine the relationships of lung function measures and RDW, with adjustment for potential confounding factors.  Results:   Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC were significantly and inversely associated with RDW after multivariate adjustments. For 1- standard deviation (SD) increase in RDW, FEV1 decreased with 0.034 L (95%CI: -0.046 to -0.022 L), p < 0.001; FVC with 0.031 L (95%CI: -0.045 to -0.017 L), p < 0.001; and FEV1/FVC with 0.003 (95%CI: -0.004 to -0.001), p = 0.002. Significant associations of RDW and DLCO were only found among smokers. For IOS, pulmonary reactance rather than resistance was significantly associated with RDW: X5 decreased 0.002 kPa/(L/s) (95%CI: -0.003 to -0.0002 kPa/(L/s)), p = 0.025, per 1-SD higher RDW.  Conclusions:   We found significant negative associations between RDW and measures of lung function. However, the effect sizes are small and RDW is not likely to be a sensitive marker of impaired lung function in middle-aged individuals from the general population.""","""['Jingxue Pan', 'Suneela Zaigham', 'Margaretha Persson', 'Yan Borné', 'Per Wollmer', 'Gunnar Engström']""","""[' Department of Clinical Sciences in Malmö, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.

However, the temporal association between OCD and subsequent stroke risk is unclear.  Methods:   Using data collected between 2001 and 2010 by Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, 28 064 adult patients with OCD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code: 300.3) and 28 064 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched controls were included in this study. Patients who developed ischemic (ICD-9-CM codes: 433, 434, and 435) and hemorrhagic (ICD-9-CM codes: 430, 431, and 432) stroke during follow-up (from enrollment to end of 2011) were identified. Moreover, medications used for treating OCD were assessed.  Results:   Patients with OCD (hazard ratio [HR], 3.02 [95% CI, 1.91–4.77]), especially middle-aged (HR, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.34–5.29]) and elderly adults (HR, 3.46 [95% CI, 1.70–7.05]), had an elevated risk of developing ischemic stroke during the follow-up period compared with non-OCD controls. The cumulative HR of hemorrhagic stroke did not differ (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.42–1.80]) between the OCD and non-OCD groups. In patients with OCD, both short- (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.74–3.88]; HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.05–1.95]) and long-term use (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.60–3.16]; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.22–3.76]) of OCD medications were not correlated with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke compared with nonuse.  Conclusions:   Clinicians should closely monitor cerebrovascular disease and related risks in patients with OCD.

We aimed to examine the prognostic relationship between MR reduction and outcomes after TMVr and GDMT alone.  Methods:   Outcomes in COAPT between 30 days and 2 years were examined on the basis of the severity of residual MR at 30 days.  Results:   TMVr-treated patients had less severe residual MR at 30 days than GDMT-treated patients (0/1+, 2+, and 3+/4+: 72.9%, 19.9%, and 7.2% versus 8.2%, 26.1%, and 65.8%, respectively [P<0.0001]). The rate of composite death or heart failure hospitalizations between 30 days and 2 years was lower in patients with 30-day residual MR of 0/1+ and 2+ compared with patients with 30-day residual MR of 3+/4+ (37.7% versus 49.5% versus 72.2%, respectively [P<0.0001]). This relationship was consistent in the TMVr and GDMT arms (Pinteraction=0.92). The improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score from baseline to 30 days was maintained between 30 days and 2 years in patients with 30-day MR ≤2+ but deteriorated in those with 30-day MR 3+/4+ (-0.3±1.7 versus -9.4±4.6 [P=0.0008]) consistently in both groups (Pinteraction=0.95).  Conclusions:   In the COAPT trial, reduced MR at 30 days was associated with greater freedom from death or heart failure hospitalizations and improved quality of life through 2-year follow-up whether the MR reduction was achieved by TMVr or GDMT.

A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions.

Objective:   The aim was to distinguish between two differential diagnoses suggested by earlier osteological examination of the remains; either tuberculosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  Findings:   The remains tested positive for MTB complex markers, corroborating this diagnosis reached on osteological grounds. Based on positivity for the mtp40 element and a deletion in the pks15/1 locus, we conclude that infection was due to a strain of the human pathogen M.tuberculosis belonging to lineage 4. Although DNA recovered from the case was heavily fragmented, sex determination by amelogenin PCR suggested these are the remains of a young male child.

Besides motor symptoms, patients may also report non-motor symptoms such as pain, anxiety, apathy, depression, sleep problems, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. The etiology of fatigue in patients with dystonia is not yet well understood.  Aim:   To evaluate the presence of fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and daily sleepiness in patients with focal and segmental dystonia and to determine which of these non-motor symptoms influence the occurrence and severity of fatigue.  Patients and methods:   Patients were surveyed for symptoms of fatigue, depression, anxiety, night-time sleep problems, and daily sleepiness using the Fatigue Assessment Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Demographic data (sex, age, and disease duration) were collected from patient medical records. On statistical analysis, we used SPSS for Windows 10. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.  Results:   Sixty patients (43 female and 17 male) with focal or segmental dystonia were evaluated. Fatigue was reported by 67.2% of patients. Fatigue (general, physical, and mental fatigue) was found to correlate with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Daily sleepiness correlated only with mental fatigue. Disease duration, age, and gender did not influence the symptoms of fatigue. Multiple regression analysis showed that depression mostly predicted symptoms of general, physical, and mental fatigue.

Methods: A survey was offered on the crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during April 2020 (the early days of strict, social distancing restrictions). The study included 1,521 adults ages 18 years and older who resided in the US and were enrolled as MTurk workers, i.e., workers who are qualified by Amazon to complete a range of human interaction tasks, including surveys through the MTurk worker platform. Main predictors included measures of heavy drinking, marijuana, and polysubstance use. The dependent measures were measures of social distancing and personal hygiene, based on guidelines recommended at the time of the survey by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Results: We found consistent negative associations between heavy drinking and drug use and adherence to social distancing and personal hygiene. Additionally, three control variables, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were significant correlates of adherence to these measures.

Although intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) account for 10% to 15% of all strokes, the occurrence of dysphagia in this subtype of stroke has not been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall frequency and associated lesion locations and clinical predictors of dysphagia in patients with acute ICH.  Methods:   Our analysis included 132 patients with acute ICH. Clinical swallowing assessment was performed within 48 hours after admission. All patients underwent computed tomography imaging. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to determine lesion sites associated with dysphagia.  Results:   Eighty-four patients (63.6%) were classified as dysphagic. Higher scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, larger ICH volumes, and higher degree of disability were associated with dysphagia. Voxels showing a statistically significant association with dysphagia were mainly located in the right insular cortex, the right central operculum, as well as the basal ganglia, corona radiata, and the left thalamus and left internal capsule. In contrast to lobar regions, in subcortical deep brain areas also small lesion volumes (<10 mL) were associated with a substantial risk of dysphagia. Intraventricular ICH extension and midline shift as imaging findings indicating a space-occupying effect were not associated with dysphagia in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   Dysphagia is a frequent symptom in acute ICH. Distinct cortical and subcortical lesion sites are related to swallowing dysfunction and predictive for the development of dysphagia. Therefore, patients with ICH should be carefully evaluated for dysphagia independently from lesion size, in particular if deep brain regions are affected.""","""['Felix Hess', 'Christian Foerch', 'Fee Keil', 'Alexander Seiler#', 'Sriramya Lapa#']""","""[' Department of Neurology (F.H., C.F., A.S., S.L.), Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', ' Institute of Neuroradiology (F.K.), Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Stroke""","""['Effects of Insular Cortex on Post-Stroke Dysphagia: A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis.', 'The impact of lesion location on dysphagia incidence, pattern and complications in acute stroke.

The present study aimed to explore the potential risk factors of undernutrition among children under 5 years of age in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) were used. A total of 974 children under 5 years of age were involved. A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used at a 5 % level of significance to determine the individual- and community-level factors associated with childhood undernutrition. The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight was 46⋅3, 9⋅8 and 28⋅4 %, respectively. About 23⋅1 % of children were both stunting and underweight, 7⋅3 % were both underweight and wasting and 4⋅5 % of children had all three conditions. Among the factors considered in the present study, the age of a child in months, birth weight, mother educational level, sex of household head, sources of drinking water and the type of toilet facility were significantly associated with undernutrition in the Amhara Region. Undernutrition among under-five children was one of the public health problems in the Amhara Region.

This work compares the chemical emissions of three ANDD in comparison to cigarette smoke. All the tested ANDD are characterized by not involving combustion of tobacco.  Aims and methods:   Single-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPI-TOFMS) is coupled to a linear smoking machine, which allows a comprehensive, online analysis of the gaseous phase of the ANDD aerosol and the conventional cigarette (CC) smoke. The following devices were investigated in this study: a tobacco cigarette with a glowing piece of coal as a heating source, an electric device for heating tobacco, and a first-generation electronic cigarette. Data obtained from a standard 2R4F research cigarette are taken as a reference.  Results:   The puff-by-puff profile of all products was recorded. The ANDD show a substantial reduction or complete absence of known harmful and potentially harmful substances compared with the CC. In addition, tar substances (i.e. semivolatile and low volatile aromatic and phenolic compounds) are formed to a much lower extent. Nicotine, however, is supplied in comparable amounts except for the investigated electronic cigarette.  Conclusions:   The data show that consumers switching from CC to ANDD are exposed to lower concentrations of harmful and potentially harmful substances. However, toxicological and epidemiological studies must deliver conclusive results if these reduced exposures are beneficial for users.  Implications:   The comparison of puff-resolved profiles of emissions from different tobacco products, traditional and alternative, may help users switch to lower emission products. Puff-resolved comparison overcomes technical changes, use modes between products and may help in their regulation.""","""['Jan Heide', 'Thomas W Adam', 'Erik Jacobs', 'Jan-Martin Wolter', 'Sven Ehlert', 'Andreas Walte', 'Ralf Zimmermann']""","""[' Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Chair of Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', ' Joint Mass Spectrometry Centre, Cooperation Group ""Comprehensive Molecular Analytics"", Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', ' Bundeswehr University Munich, Neubiberg, Germany.', ' Photonion GmbH, Schwerin, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Nicotine Tob Res""","""['Characterization of puff-by-puff resolved cigarette mainstream smoke by single photon ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and principal component analysis.', 'Nicotine Delivery to the Aerosol of a Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco Product: Comparison With a Tobacco Cigarette and E-Cigarettes.', 'Puff-by-puff resolved characterisation of cigarette mainstream smoke by single photon ionisation (SPI)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS): comparison of the 2R4F research cigarette and pure Burley, Virginia, Oriental and Maryland tobacco cigarettes.', 'Quantitative puff-by-puff-resolved characterization of selected toxic compounds in cigarette mainstream smoke.', 'Heat-not-burn tobacco products: an emerging threat to cardiovascular health.']"""

Here, we show that engrafting mice with memory CD4+ T cells from HIV+ donors uniquely allows for the in vivo evaluation of autologous T cell responses while avoiding graft-versus-host disease and the need for human fetal tissues that limit other models. Treating HIV-infected mice with clinically relevant HIV-specific T cell products resulted in substantial reductions in viremia. In vivo activity was significantly enhanced when T cells were engineered with surface-conjugated nanogels carrying an IL-15 superagonist, but it was ultimately limited by the pervasive selection of a diverse array of escape mutations, recapitulating patterns seen in humans. By applying mathematical modeling, we show that the kinetics of the CD8+ T cell response have a profound impact on the emergence and persistence of escape mutations.

Methods:   The present study provides initial data on this topic by assessing mental health symptoms (SCL-90) and suicidality (BSSI) in N = 213 gay men in Tehran, Iran.  Results:   Last-week mental health symptoms were severe in 4.2% of gay men, moderate in 7.5%, minor in 27.7%, and absent in 61.6% of Iranian gay men. Regarding last-week suicidality: 1.9% were highly likely to attempt suicide, 7.5% reported having threatened to commit suicide, 19.7% reported suicidal ideation, and 80.28% revealed no suicidality. Last-week mental health symptoms and last-week suicidality were correlated in gay men to a high degree.  Conclusions:   When descriptively comparing the SCL-90 and BSSI scores with those in the general Iranian population reported in previous studies, gay men reported more serious mental health symptoms, and more suicidal ideation, threats, and attempts.

The study assesses the risk of NAFLD according to obesity and metabolic health status in a community-based population.  Methods:   A total of 1651 subjects were recruited from the community. Individuals were categorized into four groups according to obesity status (defined as a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) and metabolically healthy status: metabolically healthy nonobesity (MHNO), metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), metabolically unhealthy nonobesity (MUHNO), and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO). NAFLD was diagnosed based on a semiquantitative ultrasonography measurement. Visceral fat was assessed through bioelectrical impedance analysis and is shown by tertile (T1, T2, and T3). A proportional odds model was used to assess the cumulative risk of NAFLD.  Results:   The NAFLD prevalence was 26.7%, 62.8%, 47.0%, and 76.7% in subjects with MHNO, MHO, MUHNO, and MUHO, respectively (P < 0.0001).

We aimed to assess and compare clinical outcomes of CABG patients with delirium with a specific focus on the blood biochemical parameters.  Methods:   This investigation was carried out on the 90 eligible patients undergoing CABG. Delirium was measured using the Neecham confusion scale and assessed patients were divided into two groups of delirium (n = 43) and non-delirium (n = 47). Preoperative variables and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared.  Results:   Delirium patients were older (p = 0.003) and had longer intubation time (p = 0.003). Non-delirium patients obtained a significantly higher Neecham confusion score (p = 0.001), and delirium patients experienced a hyperglycemic state at intraoperative (p = 0.004), intubation (p = 0.03), and extubation time (p = 0.02). Lower value of pH was seen at intubation (p = 0.03) and extubation periods (p = 0.001) in delirium group. A significant difference in base excess was observed between two groups at intubation (p = 0.04) and extubation periods (p = 0.004). Potassium level showed a significant decrease in delirium group at intubation (p = 0.01) and extubation periods (p = 0.001). Multivariate regression indicated that aging (OR = 1.08, p = 0.01), narcotic consumption (OR = 3.27, p = 0.05), DM (OR = 3.03, p=0.03), and prolonged intubation (OR = 1.18, p = 0.03) are predictors of delirium.

Transmission classification and health system capacity were used to assess the risk level of each country to guide implementation and adjustments to PHSM. Two countries out of 46 assessed met the criteria for sporadic transmission, one for clusters of cases, and 43 (93.5%) for community transmission (CT) including three with uncontrolled disease incidence (Eswatini, Namibia and South Africa). Health system response's capacities were assessed as adequate in two countries (4.3%), moderate in 13 countries (28.3%) and limited in 31 countries (64.4%). The risk level, calculated as a combination of transmission classification and health system response's capacities, was assessed at level 0 in one country (2.1%), level 1 in two countries (4.3%), level 2 in 11 countries (23.9%) and level 3 in 32 (69.6%) countries. The scale of severity ranged from 0 to 4, with 0 the lowest. CT coupled with limited response capacity resulted in a level 3 risk assessment in most countries. Countries at level 3 should be considered as priority focus for additional assistance, in order to prevent the risk rising to level 4, which may necessitate enforcing hard and costly lockdown measures.

Also, research on autism spectrum disorders has evolved in recent years, emphasizing that the behavioral traits within these neuropsychiatric disorders exist on a dimension both within and outside the boundaries of psychopathology. In the present study, the relationship between personality traits associated with autistic functioning and level of alcohol use among patients before and after concluded AUD treatment was investigated. The participants (n = 165, diagnosed with AUD) were part of a longitudinal project on AUD treatment. Data from personality questionnaires (Structured Clinical Interview of Personality Disorders II and Temperament and Character Inventory) were used to assess autistic personality traits (APTs) based on behavior within Wing's triad, which were related to background and treatment outcome. The chosen APT items illustrated a personality functioning with an emphasis on social interaction and rigidity. Only certain included questions were indicative of still having a problematic drinking pattern 2.5 years after treatment entry, which adhered to phobic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizoid personality traits, as well as rigidity/stubbornness. Albeit with modest influence, the degree of APTs was associated with heavier drinking at treatment entry, and symptoms relating to social interaction and rigidity were associated with still having a problematic drinking pattern 2.5 years after treatment entry. A higher degree of such traits may result in having problems taking advice from others and establishing treatment alliance, important parts of treatment efficacy, making assessment of such traits relevant to clinicians.""","""['Malin Hildebrand Karlén', 'Jonas Stålheim', 'Kristina Berglund', 'Peter Wennberg']""","""[' Department of Psychology.', ' Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""J Nerv Ment Dis""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'Overlap of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder traits among OCD outpatients: an exploratory study.', 'The Severity of Personality Pathology: A Risk Factor for Concurrent Substance Use Disorders in Alcohol Use Disorder.', 'Prediction of alcohol use disorder using personality disorder traits: a twin study.', 'Personality disorder and treatment outcome in alcohol use disorder.']"""

Most affected individuals have point mutations or small insertions or deletions within the PTCH1 gene on human chromosome 9, but there are some cases with more extensive deletion of the region, usually including the neighboring FANCC and/or ERCC6L2 genes. We report a 16-year-old patient with a deletion of approximately 400,000 bases which removes only PTCH1 and some non-coding RNA genes but leaves FANCC and ERCC6L2 intact. In spite of the small amount of DNA for which he is haploid, his phenotype is more extreme than many individuals with longer deletions in the region. This includes early presentation with a large number of basal cell nevi and other skin lesions, multiple jaw keratocysts, and macrosomia. We found that the deletion was in the paternal chromosome, in common with other macrosomia cases. Using public databases, we have examined possible interactions between sequences within and outside the deletion and speculate that a regulatory relationship exists with flanking genes, which is unbalanced by the deletion, resulting in abnormal activation or repression of the target genes and hence the severity of the phenotype.""","""['Adam D Ewing', 'Seth W Cheetham', 'James J McGill', 'Michael Sharkey', 'Rick Walker', 'Jennifer A West', 'Malcolm J West', 'Kim M Summers']""","""[' Mater Research Institute-University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', "" Department of Chemical Pathology, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Queensland, Australia."", ' Paddington Dermatology Specialist Clinic, Paddington, Queensland, Australia.', "" QLD Youth Cancer Service, Queensland Children's Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", ' School of Clinical Medicine, The University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', ' Northside Clinical School, Prince Charles Hospital, The University of Queensland, Chermside, Queensland, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Am J Med Genet A""","""['Multiple tumor types including leiomyoma and Wilms tumor in a patient with Gorlin syndrome due to 9q22.3 microdeletion encompassing the PTCH1 and FANC-C loci.', 'Unexpected phenotype in a frameshift mutation of PTCH1.', 'Basal Cell Nevus (Gorlin) Syndrome with a Novel Heterozygous Deletion Frameshift Mutation (C.959delc, P.val322 Phe Fsx2) in the Ptch1 Gene Associated with Epiretinal Membrane, Odontogenic Keratocysts and without Skin Lesions and Falx Cerebri Calcification.', '9q22.3 Microdeletion – RETIRED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY.', 'Delineation of an interstitial 9q22 deletion in basal cell nevus syndrome.']"""

However, as emerging evidence from the realms of genetic toxicology and epigenomics demonstrate, heritability may be better understood as encompassing not only DNA sequence passed down through generations, but also disruptions to the parental germ cells causing de novo mutations or epigenetic alterations, with subsequent shifts in gene expression and functions in offspring. The Beyond Genes conference highlighted advances in understanding these aspects at molecular, experimental, and epidemiological levels. In this commentary I suggest that future research on this topic could be inspired by collecting parents' germ cell exposure histories, with particular attention to cases of families with multiple children suffering idiopathic disorders. In so doing I focus on the endpoint of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Rates of this serious neurodevelopment disability have climbed around the world, a growing crisis that cannot be explained by diagnostic shifts. ASD's strong heritability has prompted a research program largely focused on DNA sequencing to locate rare and common variants, but decades of this gene-focused research have revealed surprisingly little about the molecular origins of the disorder. Based on my experience as the mother of two children with idiopathic autism, and as a research philanthropist and autism advocate, I suggest ways researchers might probe parental germ cell exposure histories to develop new hypotheses that may ultimately reveal sources of nongenetic heritability in a subset of idiopathic heritable pathologies.""","""['Jill Escher']""","""[' Escher Fund for Autism, San Jose, CA, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Biol Reprod""","""['Beyond Genes: Germline Disruption in the Etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders.', 'The genetics of autism.', 'Bugs in the program: can pregnancy drugs and smoking disturb molecular reprogramming of the fetal germline, increasing heritable risk for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders?', 'Germ cell-mediated mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance.', 'Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance.', 'Epigenetics Role in Spermatozoa Function: Implications in Health and Evolution-An Overview.', 'Beyond Genes: Germline Disruption in the Etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders.']"""

Metals can influence the biology of living cells by a variety of mechanisms, depending not only on the dose and length of exposure but also on the type and stage of differentiation of target cells. We explored the effect of five heavy metals (Cu, Hg, Pd, W and Zn) at nanomolar concentrations (the biocontamination level in residents of the volcanic area in Sicily where thyroid cancer is increased) on stimulating the proliferation of undifferentiated (thyrospheres) and differentiated human thyroid cells. Thyrosphere proliferation was significantly increased after exposure to each individual metal and a greater stimulating effect was observed when a mixture of the examined metals was used. No effect was seen in differentiated thyrocytes. For all metals, the dose-response curve followed a biphasic pattern that is typical of hormesis. Thyrosphere growth concerned the size rather than number, except with the metal mixture. An altered morphology was also observed in metal-treated thyrospheres. Metal-induced proliferation was due to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, as confirmed by growth inhibition when ERK1/2 signaling was blocked. These studies show that stem/precursor thyroid cells are sensitive to small increases in environmental metal concentrations that are harmless for differentiated thyrocytes.""","""['Fiorenza Gianì', 'Roberta Masto', 'Maria Antonietta Trovato', 'Annarita Franco', 'Giuseppe Pandini', 'Riccardo Vigneri']""","""[' Endocrinology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Garibaldi-Nesima Medical Center, Catania, Italy.', ' Surgical Oncology, Garibaldi-Nesima Medical Center, Catania, Italy.', ' Crystallography Institute, National Research Council, CNR Catania Section, Catania, Italy.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['Heavy Metals in the Environment and Thyroid Cancer.', 'Effect of low-dose tungsten on human thyroid stem/precursor cells and their progeny.', 'Heavy metals in the volcanic environment and thyroid cancer.', 'Increased Thyroid Cancer Incidence in Volcanic Areas: A Role of Increased Heavy Metals in the Environment?', 'Increased thyroid cancer incidence in a basaltic volcanic area is associated with non-anthropogenic pollution and biocontamination.', 'High Incidence of Thyroid Cancer in Southern Tuscany (Grosseto Province, Italy): Potential Role of Environmental Heavy Metal Pollution.', 'Heavy Metals in the Environment and Thyroid Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We enrolled here 100 APD patients and 60 caregivers. Seventy-four patients were treated with device-aided therapies (DAT) and 26 with standard medical treatment (SMT). Through a telephonic interview, subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A; HADS-D), and an ad hoc questionnaire to explore thoughts and emotions related to the pandemic.  Results:   Depression was observed in 35% of APD patients and anxiety in 39%, with a significant reduction of the latter after the lockdown (p= 0.023). We found a significant correlation between the type of therapy and the HADS-A score (p= 0.004). Patients' main worries were as follows: a possible higher risk of COVID-19 infection (25%), interruption of non-pharmacological treatments (35%), interruption of outpatient clinics (38%), PD complications related to COVID-19 (47%). Patients treated with DAT manifested worries about device-related issues and risk for caregivers' infection. The 40% of caregivers showed anxiety, while the 21.7% of them showed depression.  Conclusion:   Our study reveals a higher prevalence of anxiety and the presence of peculiar worries and needs in APD patients during the pandemic alongside psychological sequelae of their caregivers.

Serum levels of MMPs and TIMPs along with the expression of genes coding these proteins are related to the recovery and appearance of adverse effects (AE) after AIS. Consequently, it is important to explore whether polymorphisms in regulatory sequences of MMPs and TIMPs are associated with rtPA response in AIS patients.  Objectives:   To determine whether selected polymorphic variants within MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-2 genes may influence rtPA therapy response with regard to outcomes in patients with AIS and the occurrence of AE.  Methods:   Our study included 166 patients suffering AIS, treated with rtPA. Patients' recovery was estimated using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3 months after the AIS occurred. Favorable outcome was defined with scores 0-1 and poor outcome with scores 2-6. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864, rs2277698, and rs8179090) and PCR-RFLP (rs2285053, rs3918242) methods. Additionally, rtPA AE were followed during the hospitalization.  Results:   There was no significant association between genotypes and alleles of selected polymorphisms and rtPA therapy response measured through the decrease of the mRS score in patients with AIS. Intracranial hemorrhage, as well as parenchymal hematoma type 2, was significantly more frequent in patients with TT genotype of the MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism (p = 0.047, p = 0.011, respectively). Patients with intracranial hemorrhages after rtPA were significantly more likely to have the TT genotype of TIMP-2-303C/T polymorphism and the TT genotype of MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism (p < 0.001).

Objectives:   In two studies of low-income mothers, we investigated the presence of psychoneurological symptoms and explored associations between mothers' stressors and psychoneurological symptoms as well as between symptoms and function. We also considered the possible mediating role of the symptoms between stressors and function.  Methods:   We conducted secondary analyses of psychoneurological symptoms in two studies of low-income mothers of infants and toddlers in the United States. Study 1 sampled Latina women with limited English proficiency, whereas Study 2 was conducted with English-speaking women from diverse backgrounds. In both studies, symptoms were measured using items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey. Maternal function was measured through self-report and researcher observation. In Study 2, stressors were measured using the Everyday Stressors Index. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate associations while controlling for relevant covariates.  Results:   In both studies, mothers endorsed a wide range of psychoneurological symptoms. In Study 1, psychoneurological symptoms had significant negative associations with role function, social function, and developmental stimulation. In Study 2, psychoneurological symptoms had significant negative associations with role function, social function, and physical function. Using Aroian test for mediation, we found that psychoneurological symptoms mediated all significant relationships between stressors and maternal functions in Study 2.  Discussion:   In two samples of low-income mothers, psychoneurological symptoms were prevalent and associated with chronic stressors and with maternal function and may mediate the association between those two factors.

Methods:   Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017, we compared sex-specific and age-standardized rates of disability-adjusted life years (DALY); mortality, incidence, and prevalence of IHD and stroke; and dementia per 100,000 people, in the world, OECD countries, and Canada.  Results:   From 1990 to 2017, the crude incidence number of IHD, stroke, and dementia increased 52%, 76%, and 113%, respectively. Likewise, the prevalence of IHD (75%), stroke (95%), and dementia (119%) increased worldwide. In addition during the study period, the crude global number of deaths of IHD increased 52%, stroke by 41%, and dementia by 146% (9, 6, and 3 million deaths in 2017, respectively). Despite an increase in the crude number of these diseases, the global age-standardized incidence rate of IHD, stroke, and dementia decreased by -27%, - 11%, and - 5%, respectively. Moreover, there was a decline in their age-standardized DALY rates (- 1.17%, - 1.32%, and - 0.23% per year, respectively) and death rates (- 1.29%, - 1.46%, and - 0.17% per year, respectively), with sharper downward trends in Canada and OECD countries. Almost all trends flattened during the last decade.  Conclusions:   From 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized burden of IHD, stroke, and dementia decreased, more prominently in OECD countries than the world. However, their rising crude numbers mainly due to population growth and ageing require urgent identification of reversible risk and protective factors.""","""['Negar Morovatdar', 'Abolfazl Avan', 'M Reza Azarpazhooh', 'Mario Di Napoli', 'Saverio Stranges', 'Moira K Kapral', 'Arash Akhavan Rezayat', 'Aidin Shariatzadeh', 'Shahram Abootalebi', 'Naghmeh Mokhber', 'J David Spence', 'Vladimir Hachinski']""","""[' Clinical Research Development Unit, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Department of Public Health, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre, Robarts Research Institute, Western University, Siebens-Drake Building, 1400 Western Rd, London, ON, N6G 2V4, Canada. reza.azarpazhooh@lhsc.on.ca.', ' Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, ON, Canada. reza.azarpazhooh@lhsc.on.ca.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. reza.azarpazhooh@lhsc.on.ca.', "" Department of Neurology and Stroke Unit, San Camillo de' Lellis General District Hospital, Rieti, Italy."", "" Neurological Section, Neuro-epidemiology Unit, SMDN-Centre for Cardiovascular Medicine and Cerebrovascular Disease Prevention, Sulmona, L'Aquila, Italy."", ' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', ' Department of Population Health, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.', '0 Department of Medicine and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '1 Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '2 Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre, Robarts Research Institute, Western University, Siebens-Drake Building, 1400 Western Rd, London, ON, N6G 2V4, Canada.', '3 Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital, Dalhousie University, New Brunswick, Canada.', '4 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', '5 Department of Psychiatry, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '6 Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', '7 Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Neurol Sci""","""['Global, Regional and Country-Specific Burden of Ischaemic Stroke, Intracerebral Haemorrhage and Subarachnoid Haemorrhage: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.', 'The global burden of ischemic heart disease in 1990 and 2010: the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study.', 'Global variation in the relative burden of stroke and ischemic heart disease.', 'Socioeconomic status and stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and worldwide burden: an ecological analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.', 'Global Overview of the Epidemiology of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Mortality trend analysis of ischemic heart disease in China between 2010 and 2019: a joinpoint analysis.', 'TNFR-1 and GDF-15 Are Associated With Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain and Progranulin Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of the MAPT Study.', ""Social Determinants of Stroke Hospitalization and Mortality in United States' Counties."", 'Tanhuo Formula Inhibits Astrocyte Activation and Apoptosis in Acute Ischemic Stroke.', 'Acute glycemic variability and mortality of patients with acute stroke: a meta-analysis.']"""

However, there is a high rate of recurrence, and new approaches are required to improve surgical efficacy. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT) before RP for Japanese patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   From February 2009 to April 2016, 21 high-risk patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were treated with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) every four weeks for three cycles and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. Patients with grade 3-4 toxicities had 25% dose reductions for the following course.  Results:   Median follow-up was 88.6 months. The dose of docetaxel was reduced in 13 patients. The estimated five-year biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) rate was 57.1%. National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria (high-risk, but not very high-risk (nVHR) versus VHR) was associated with bPFS (p = 0.03). Five-year bPFS rates in the nVHR and VHR groups were 76.9% and 25.0%, respectively. There was a significant difference in bPFS between the nVHR and VHR groups (p = 0.023) by Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Conclusions:   Although our study included a small number of cases, at least in our exploration, NCHT was safe and feasible.

Methods:   In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned women undergoing cesarean delivery before or during labor at 34 or more gestational weeks to receive an intravenously administered prophylactic uterotonic agent and either tranexamic acid (1 g) or placebo. The primary outcome was postpartum hemorrhage, defined as a calculated estimated blood loss greater than 1000 ml or receipt of a red-cell transfusion within 2 days after delivery. Secondary outcomes included gravimetrically estimated blood loss, provider-assessed clinically significant postpartum hemorrhage, use of additional uterotonic agents, and postpartum blood transfusion.  Results:   Of the 4551 women who underwent randomization, 4431 underwent cesarean delivery, 4153 (93.7%) of whom had primary outcome data available. The primary outcome occurred in 556 of 2086 women (26.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 653 of 2067 (31.6%) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.94; P = 0.003). There were no significant between-group differences in mean gravimetrically estimated blood loss or in the percentage of women with provider-assessed clinically significant postpartum hemorrhage, use of additional uterotonic agents, or postpartum blood transfusion. Thromboembolic events in the 3 months after delivery occurred in 0.4% of women (8 of 2049) who received tranexamic acid and in 0.1% of women (2 of 2056) who received placebo (adjusted risk ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 0.85 to 18.92; P = 0.08).  Conclusions:   Among women who underwent cesarean delivery and received prophylactic uterotonic agents, tranexamic acid treatment resulted in a significantly lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss greater than 1000 ml or red-cell transfusion by day 2 than placebo, but it did not result in a lower incidence of hemorrhage-related secondary clinical outcomes.

Based on 17,123 and 8693 emergency attendance for stroke and AMI, an interrupted time-series (ITS) study was conducted. Since 01/24/2020, the top two levels of regulations on major public health have been implemented in Beijing. This study covered from 03/01/2018 to 06/03/2020, including 19 weeks of lockdown period and 99 weeks before. A segmented Poisson regression model was used to estimate the immediate change and the monthly change in the secular trend of the emergency attendance rates. The emergency attendance rates of stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the lockdown period, with 52.1% (95% CI 45.8% to 57.7%) and 63.1% (95% CI 56.1% to 63.1%) immediate decreases for stroke and AMI, respectively. Then during the lockdown period, 7.0% (95% CI 2.5%, 11.6%) and 16.1% (95% CI 9.5, 23.1) increases per month in the secular trends of emergency attendance rates were shown for stroke and AMI, respectively. Though the accelerated increasing rates, there were estimated 1335 and 747 patients with stroke and AMI without seeking emergency medical aid during the lockdown, respectively. The emergency attendance for stroke and AMI cut in half at the beginning of the pandemic then had gradual restoration thereafter. The results hint the need for more engagement and communications with all stakeholders to reduce the negative impact on CVD emergency medical services during the crisis.""","""['Yiqun Wu#', 'Fei Chen#', 'Zhaobin Sun', 'Yingxian Zhang', 'Yafang Song', 'Wuwei Feng', 'Yuping Wang', 'Ying Liu', 'Haiqing Song']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', ' Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, NO.45 Changchun Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100053, China.', ' Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing, 100089, China.', ' National Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing, 100081, China.', ' Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', ' Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, NO.45 Changchun Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100053, China. wangyuping01@sina.cn.', ' Beijing Stroke Quality Control Center, Beijing, 100053, China. wangyuping01@sina.cn.', ' Beijing Municipal Health Commission, No. 70 Zaolinqian Street, Beijing, 100053, China. 13901124008@139.com.', ' Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, NO.45 Changchun Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100053, China. songhq@xwhosp.org.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""J Thromb Thrombolysis""","""['Changes in Acute Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Heart Failure Hospitalizations During COVID-19 Pandemic in Tuscany-An Interrupted Time Series Study.', 'Case Rates, Treatment Approaches, and Outcomes in Acute Myocardial Infarction During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.', ""Impact of Qingdao's smoke-free legislation on hospitalizations and mortality from acute myocardial infarction and stroke: an interrupted time-series analysis."", 'Management of acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Consensus Statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP).', 'Early identification and delay to treatment in myocardial infarction and stroke: differences and similarities.', 'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergent stroke care in Beijing, China.', 'Emergency medical service utilization among acute ischemic stroke patients in Beijing: An observational study.', ""Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on STEMI thrombolysis and Emergency Department's performance in a non-PCI capable tertiary hospital."", 'Changes in nationwide in-hospital stroke care during the first four waves of COVID-19 in Germany.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on emergency patients in the resuscitation room: A cross-sectional study.']"""

However, there is a paucity of evidence from randomised trials supporting this approach compared with conventional in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). We aimed to investigate whether intracytoplasmic sperm injection would result in a higher livebirth rate compared with conventional IVF.  Methods:   This open-label, multicentre, randomised trial was done at two IVF centres in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (IVFMD, My Duc Hospital and IVFAS, An Sinh Hospital). Eligible couples were aged at least 18 years and the male partner's sperm count and motility (progressive motility) were normal based on WHO 2010 criteria. Couples had to have undergone two or fewer previous conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection attempts, have used an antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation, and agree to have two or fewer embryos transferred. Couples were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo either intracytoplasmic sperm injection or conventional IVF, using block randomisation with variable block size of 2, 4, or 8 and a telephone-based central randomisation method. The computer-generated randomisation list was prepared by an independent statistician who had no other involvement in the study. Embryologists and couples were not masked to study groups because of the type of interventions and differences in hospital fees, but clinicians performing embryo transfer were unaware of study group allocation. The primary outcome was livebirth after the first embryo transfer from the initiated cycle. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03428919.  Findings:   Between March 16, 2018, and Aug 12, 2019, we randomly assigned 1064 couples to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (n=532) or conventional IVF (n=532). Livebirth after the first embryo transfer from the initiated cycle occurred in 184 (35%) of 532 couples randomly assigned to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in 166 (31%) of 532 couples randomly assigned to conventional IVF (absolute difference 3·4%, 95% CI -2·4 to 9·2; risk ratio [RR] 1·11, 95% CI 0·93 to 1·32; p=0·27). 29 (5%) couples in the intracytoplasmic sperm injection group and 34 (6%) couples in the conventional IVF group had fertilisation failure (absolute difference -0·9%, -4·0 to 2·1, RR 0·85, 95% CI 0·53 to 1·38; p=0·60).  Interpretation:   In couples with infertility in whom the male partner has a normal total sperm count and motility, intracytoplasmic sperm injection did not improve the livebirth rate compared with conventional IVF. Our results challenge the value of the routine use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection in assisted reproduction techniques for this population.

Methods:   LT recipients followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and healthy volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies directed against the Spike-protein (S) and Nucleocapsid-protein (N) 10-20 days after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data was collected from patients and medical records.  Results:   Eighty LT recipients were enrolled. Mean age was 60 years and 30% were female. Twenty-five healthy volunteer controls were younger (mean age 52.7 years, p = 0.013) and mostly female (68%, p = 0.002). All participants were negative for IgG N-protein serology, indicating immunity did not result from prior COVID-19 infection. All controls were positive for IgG S-protein serology. Immunogenicity among LT recipients was significantly lower with positive serology in only 47.5% (p <0.001). Antibody titer was also significantly lower in this group (mean 95.41 AU/ml vs. 200.5 AU/ml in controls, p <0.001). Predictors for negative response among LT recipients were older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and treatment with high dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. No serious adverse events were reported in either group.  Conclusion:   LT recipients developed substantially lower immunological response to the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccine. Factors influencing serological antibody responses include age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications. The findings require re-evaluation of vaccine regimens in this population.  Lay summary:   The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited substantially inferior immunity in liver transplant recipients. Less than half of the patients developed sufficient levels of antibodies against the virus, and in those who were positive, average antibody levels were 2x less compared to healthy controls. Factors predicting non-response were older age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications.""","""['Liane Rabinowich', 'Ayelet Grupper', 'Roni Baruch', 'Merav Ben-Yehoyada', 'Tami Halperin', 'Dan Turner', 'Eugene Katchman', 'Sharon Levi', 'Inbal Houri', 'Nir Lubezky', 'Oren Shibolet', 'Helena Katchman']""","""[' Organ Transplantation Unit, Division of Surgery, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; Liver Unit, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.

Research question:   What are rates of molecular and PD-L1 biomarker testing in patients with advanced NSCLC in community practices, and do rates vary by sociodemographic factors? What is the prevalence of molecular biomarker mutations and PD-L1 expression levels?  Study design and methods:   From 389 stage IV NSCLC pathology reports obtained through the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center's Rapid Case Ascertainment Program from 38 community hospitals across North Carolina, we abstracted demographics, histology, molecular biomarker testing and results, and PD-L1 testing and expression. We geocoded patient and hospital addresses to determine travel time, distance to care, and census block level contextual variables. We compared molecular biomarker and PD-L1 testing rates, the prevalence of molecular biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression levels by race and sex, using χ2 tests. We determined predictors of testing, using multivariable logistic regression and report adjusted ORs and 95%CI.  Results:   Among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, 64.4% were tested for molecular biomarkers, and among all NSCLC patients 53.2% were tested for PD-L1 expression. Differences in biomarker testing rates by sociodemographic factors were not statistically significant in univariate or adjusted analyses. Adjusted analyses showed that patients living in areas with higher household internet access were more likely to undergo PD-L1 testing (adjusted OR = 1.66, 95% CI, 1.02-2.71). Sociodemographic differences in molecular biomarker prevalence and PD-L1 expression levels were not statistically significant, except for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations, which occurred in 16.7% of males vs 0% in females, P = .05.  Interpretation:   Biomarker testing remains underused in NSCLC. Future work should include larger populations and evaluate hospital-specific testing protocols to identify and address barriers to guideline-recommended testing.""","""['M Patricia Rivera', 'Marjory Charlot', 'Danielle D Durham', 'Allison Throneburg', 'Lindsay M Lane', 'Pasangi Perera', 'Teresa D Samulski', 'Louise M Henderson']""","""[' Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.

However, conflicting findings arise when researchers drill down to identify the type(s) of alcohol outlets with the strongest associations with harms and the mechanisms that explain these associations. These disagreements could be a result of the outdated methods commonly used to quantify the alcohol environment: counts of the number of outlets in an area. This manuscript reviews the events and ideas that shaped the literature on the physical alcohol environment. It then defines the three main methods used to measure alcohol outlet density, conducts an exploratory factor analysis to explore the constructs underlying each method, and presents a novel conceptual framework that summarizes the three methods, their respective underlying constructs, and the setting(s) in which each may be most appropriate. The framework proposes that counts of alcohol outlets measure availability, proximity to the nearest outlet measures accessibility, and spatial access measures measure access, which comprises both availability and accessibility. We argue that researchers should consider using proximity and spatial access measures when possible and outline how doing so may present opportunities to advance theory and the design and implementation of alcohol outlet zoning regulations. Finally, this manuscript draws on research from other areas of the built environment to suggest opportunities to use novel methods to overcome common hurdles (e.g., separating subtypes of outlets, ecologic designs) and a new challenge on the horizon: home delivery.""","""['P J Trangenstein', 'R Sadler', 'C N Morrison', 'D H Jernigan']""","""[' University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, Department of Health Behavior, Chapel Hill, NC 29599.', ' Boston University School of Public Health, Department of Health Law, Policy, and Management, Boston, MA 02118.', ' Michigan State University College of Human Medicine Department of Family Medicine/Division of Public Health Flint, MI 48502.', ' Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, New York, NY 10032.', ' Monash University School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021;29(""","""Addict Res Theory""","""['Accessibility and availability of alcohol outlets around schools: An ecological study in the city of Madrid, Spain, according to socioeconomic area-level.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Association Between Alcohol Outlet Density and Violent Crime.', 'Change in alcohol outlet density and alcohol-related harm to population health (CHALICE): a comprehensive record-linked database study in Wales.', 'Mapping Patterns and Trends in the Spatial Availability of Alcohol Using Low-Level Geographic Data: A Case Study in England 2003-2013.', 'Relating off-premises alcohol outlet density to intentional and unintentional injuries.', 'Establishing the Relative Accuracy of Using City Directories as Proxies to Define and Reconstruct Historical Alcohol Environments.', 'Linking Historical Discriminatory Housing Patterns to the Contemporary Alcohol Environment.', 'Mapping the Way to Good Health: The Interdisciplinary Challenges of Geographers in Medical Research.']"""

The U87 cells and U251 cells were chosen and infected with lentivirus of control overexpression, TNC overexpression, control knockdown, and TNC knockdown for functional experiments. Rescue experiments were then performed to evaluate the effect of PI3K/AKT activator 740 Y-P on cell function and chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in TNC knockdown U251 cells. TNC mRNA and protein expression was elevated in glioma cells, including U87, LN-229, U251 and T98G cells, compared to normal human astrocytes. In U87 and U251 cells, TNC promoted proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, TNC upregulated PI3K and p-AKT protein expression in U87 and U251 cells. As for chemosensitivity, TNC increased relative viability in U251 cells treated with 400 ng/mL and 800 ng/mL paclitaxel. In terms of stemness, TNC increased the sphere number per 1000 cells, CD44+CD133+ cell percentage and 1/stem cell frequency (assessed by extreme limiting dilution analysis) in U251 cells. In rescue experiments, 740 Y-P reduced the effect of TNC on proliferation, apoptosis, chemosensitivity to paclitaxel, and stemness in U251 cells.

In this work, we quantify changes in patient volumes and outcomes when adding EVT capability to an existing stroke center.  Methods:   In MATLAB 2017a Simulink, we simulate a 3-center system comprising an EVT-capable comprehensive stroke center, an EVT-incapable primary stroke center, and an EVT-incapable primary stroke center that gains EVT capability (TSC). We model these changes in 2 geographic settings (urban and rural) using 2 routing paradigms (Nearest Center and Bypass). In Nearest Center, patients are sent to the nearest center regardless of EVT capability. In Bypass, patients with severe strokes are sent to the nearest EVT-capable center, and all others are sent to the nearest center. Probability of good clinical outcome is determined by type and timing of treatment using outcomes reported in clinical trials.  Results:   Adding EVT capability in the Bypass model produced an absolute increase of 40.1% in total volume of patients with stroke and 31.2% to 31.9% in total volume of acute stroke treatments at the TSC. In the Nearest Center model, the total volume of patients with stroke did not change, but total volume of acute stroke treatment at the TSC had an absolute increase of 9.3% to 9.5%. Good clinical outcomes saw an absolute increase of 0.2% to 0.6% in the whole population and 0.3% to 1.8% in the TSC population.  Conclusions:   Adding EVT capability shifts patient and treatment volume to the TSC. However, these changes produce modest improvement in overall population health.

Unfortunately, the specific medicine dantrolene is not readily available in many countries including China. The aim of this study was to find the characteristics of malignant hyperthermia under the situation that dantrolene is not readily available.  Methods:   The cases of malignant hyperthermia reported on the most commonly used databases in China from 1985 to 2020 were analyzed. The inclusion criteria were the MH episodes only related to anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were dubious MH episodes only caused by Ketamine administration or MH episodes irrelevant to anesthesia. Independent samples t-test and Pearson's chi-squared test were applied to assess the difference between the survived and death cases.  Results:   Ninety-two cases of malignant hyperthermia reported on the most commonly used databases in China from 1985 to 2020 were analyzed. Median (IQR [range]) age was 18.5 (11.8-37.0 [0-70.0]) years.

Besides, the death cases had less minimum pH (P < 0.001) and higher potassium (P < 0.001) and were more likely to have coagulation disorders (p = 0.018). Concerning treatment, cases used furosemide (P = 0.024), mannitol (P = 0.029), blood purification treatment (P = 0.017) had the advantage on the outcome. Creatine phosphokinase, myoglobin, and MB isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase differed greatly among cases during the first week. 43 (46.7%) cases had congenital diseases. 12 (13.0%) cases were reported with abnormal laboratory test results or abnormal signs that are possibly relevant before anesthesia.

In the absence of epidemiological data, chemicals carcinogenic in RCBs are typically classified as either possibly or probably carcinogenic to humans, particularly without the -numerical probability for the carcinogenicity to humans- (PPV) of the classified substance. Through the biostatistics-based and regulatorily pertinent -predictive values approach- (PVA), the present study investigated the PPV of several antimicrobials relevant to human or veterinary medicine. A combination of structure-activity relationship, mutagenicity, and tumor-related histopathology was used to resolve reliable and pertinent PPVs. For 62 specific antimicrobials (e.g., carbadox), a 97.9% (or more) probability of carcinogenicity to humans was estimated. For nitrofurantoin, a 99.9% probability of carcinogenicity to humans was reckoned. Therefore, a risk-benefit evaluation on the in-force authorization of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated human urinary infections is needed.

Methods:   We identified all women diagnosed with uterine cancer in Australia between July 2003 and December 2013 (2012 in New South Wales) through the Australian Cancer Database (N = 16,501) and linked these to the national prescription database and National Death Index to identify statin use and survival outcomes to December 2015. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between statin use and survival.  Results:   Among the 15,703 women with endometrial cancer, pre-diagnosis statin use was not associated with survival. Endometrial cancer-specific mortality was lower among women who used statins after diagnosis (time-varying models: HR = 0.92; 95%CI 0.82-1.03) but the association was only seen among women with type 1 cancers (0.87; 0.76-1.00), for hydrophilic statins (0.84; 0.68-1.03) and for new use of statins after diagnosis (0.75; 0.59-0.95). There was a weak dose-response with increasing number of statin prescriptions. Sensitivity analyses using inverse probability of treatment weights were similar.  Conclusion:   Women with endometrial cancer who take statins after diagnosis may have better survival than those who do not use statins. However, it is impossible to completely rule out bias, particularly reverse causation where disease status may affect statin use.

However, the quality of continence care is often poor, compromising patient health and well-being, increasing the risk of infection, and is a predisposing factor to nursing and residential home placement.  Objective:   To identify factors that help or hinder good continence care for patients aged 65 years and over in hospital medical ward settings. Medical care, not surgical, was our exclusive focus.  Methods:   We conducted 27 qualitative interviews with nursing, medical and allied health practitioners in three hospitals. We used a purposive sample and analysed data thematically, both manually and with the aid of NVivo software.  Results:   Interviews revealed perspectives on practice promoting or inhibiting good quality continence care, as well as suggestions for improvements. Good continence care was said to be advanced through person-centred care, robust assessment and monitoring, and a proactive approach to encouraging patient independence. Barriers to quality care centred on lack of oversight, automatic use of incontinence products and staffing pressures. Suggested improvements centred on participatory care, open communication and care planning with a higher bladder and bowel health profile. In order to drive such improvements, hospital-based practitioners indicate a need and desire for regular continence care training.  Conclusions:   Findings help explain the persistence of barriers to providing good quality care for patients aged 65 years and over with incontinence. Resolute continence promotion, in hospitals and throughout the National Health Service, would reduce reliance on products and the accompanying risks of patient dependency and catheter-associated gram-negative bacteraemia. Robust assessment and care planning, open communication and regular continence care training would assist such promotion and also help mitigate resource limitations by developing safer, time-efficient continence care.""","""['John Percival', 'Katharine Abbott', 'Theresa Allain', 'Rachel Bradley', 'Fiona Cramp', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Candy McCabe', 'Kyra Neubauer', 'Sabi Redwood', 'Nikki Cotterill']""","""[' Nursing and Midwifery, University of the West of England Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, Bristol, UK john.percival@uwe.ac.uk.', ' North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.', ' Department of Medicine for Older Persons, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', ' Department of Geriatric & Orthogeriatric Medicine, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', ' Nursing and Midwifery, University of the West of England Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, Bristol, UK.', ' Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', ' National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care West (NIHR CLAHRC West), Bristol, UK.', ' Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, UK.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""BMJ Open Qual""","""['Geriatrics.', 'Hospital practitioner views on the benefits of continence education and best ways to provide training.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Do nurses promote urinary continence in hospitalized older people?: An exploratory study.', 'National audit of continence care for older people: management of urinary incontinence.', ""Caring for continence in stroke care settings: a qualitative study of patients' and staff perspectives on the implementation of a new continence care intervention."", 'Hospital practitioner views on the benefits of continence education and best ways to provide training.']"""

Despite the strong relationship between screening and lung cancer staging, the role of healthcare expenditure in lung cancer outcomes remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between economic status and clinical outcomes in lung cancer.  Methods:   Data were obtained from GLOBOCAN and the World Health Organization. Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) and their change over time, calculated as the difference between the MIRs of 2012 and 2018 (δMIR), were used to evaluate their correlation to expenditures on healthcare and human development index (HDI) disparities via Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.  Results:   Regions such as North America have relatively high crude incidence rates but low MIR values. Furthermore, countries with lower crude incidence rates spent less on healthcare. The results show significant negative associations between HDI, current health expenditure (CHE) per capita, CHE as a percentage of gross domestic product (CHE/GDP), and MIR.

Recent epidemiological reports suggest the influence of sex-steroids in modulating a wide variety of disease conditions. Sex-based discrepancies have been reported in pulmonary physiology and various chronic inflammatory responses associated with lung diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and rare lung diseases. Notably, emerging clinical evidence suggests that several respiratory diseases affect women to a greater degree, with increased severity and prevalence than men. Although sex-specific differences in various lung diseases are evident, such differences are inherent to sex-steroids, which are major biological variables in men and women who play a central role to control these differences. The focus of this chapter is to comprehend the sex-steroid biology in inflammatory lung diseases and to understand the mechanistic role of sex-steroids signaling in regulating these diseases. Exploring the roles of sex-steroid signaling in the regulation of lung diseases and inflammation is crucial for the development of novel and effective therapy. Overall, we will illustrate the importance of differential sex-steroid signaling in lung diseases and their possible clinical implications for the development of complementary and alternative medicine to treat lung diseases.""","""['Nilesh Sudhakar Ambhore', 'Rama Satyanarayana Raju Kalidhindi', 'Venkatachalem Sathish']""","""[' Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, College of Health Professions, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA.', ' Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, College of Health Professions, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA. s.venkatachalem@ndsu.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021;130""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Sex steroid signaling: implications for lung diseases.', 'Sex differences and sex steroids in lung health and disease.', 'Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation.', 'Sex Steroids Effects on Asthma: A Network Perspective of Immune and Airway Cells.', 'Sex Steroids Induce Membrane Stress Responses and Virulence Properties in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.', 'Sexual dimorphism in chronic respiratory diseases.', 'Steady-state estradiol triggers a unique innate immune response to allergen resulting in increased airway resistance.', 'The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds and modulates estrogen receptors.', 'Molecular determinants of airway smooth muscle cells in health and disease.', 'The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds and modulates estrogen receptors.']"""

Methods:   The POLBOS I and POLBOS II were international, multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled trials. Patients were randomly assigned to BiOSS Expert (in POLBOS I, biodegradable polymer eluting paclitaxel)/BiOSS LIM (in POLBOS II, biodegradable polymer eluting sirolimus) stent implantation or regular drug-eluting stent (rDES) deployment. A provisional T-stenting strategy was the default treatment option. The primary endpoint of this pooled data study was the cumulative rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Telephone follow-up was performed annually up to 72 months. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: POLBOS I-NCT02192840, POLBOS II-NCT02198300).  Results:   The total study population consisted of 445 patients, 222 patients in the BiOSS group and 223 patients in the rDES group. The follow-up rate was 93.7% in the BiOSS group and 91.9% in the rDES group.

We conducted a survey to determine the current practices of physicians working in ICUs regarding RA for the management of chest trauma in patients with multiple traumas.  Methods:   An online questionnaire was sent to medical doctors (n = 1230) working in French ICUs, using the Société Française d'Anesthésie Réanimation (SFAR) mailing list of its members. The questionnaire addressed 3 categories: general characteristics, practical aspects of RA, and indications and contraindications.  Results:   Among the 333 respondents (response rate = 27%), 78% and 40% of 156 respondents declared that they would consider using thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and thoracic paravertebral blockade (TPB), respectively. The main benefits declared for performing RA were the ability to have effective analgesia, a more effective cough, and early rehabilitation. For 70% of the respondents, trauma patients with a theoretical indication of RA did not receive TEA or TPB for the following reasons: the ICU had no experience of RA (62%), no anesthesiologist-intensivist working in the ICU (46%), contraindications (27%), ignorance of the SFAR guidelines (19%), and no RA protocol available (13%). In this survey, 95% of the respondents thought the prognosis of trauma patients could be influenced by the use of RA.  Conclusions:   While TEA and TPB are underused because of several limitations related to the patterns of injuries in multitrauma patients, lack of both experience and confidence in combination with the absence of available protocols appear to be the major restraining factors, even if physicians are aware that patients' outcomes could be improved by RA.

Improved risk stratification may inform personalized triage and surveillance strategies. We aim to develop a urinary mRNA biomarker panel for risk stratification in patients undergoing BCa screening and surveillance.  Methods and materials:   Urine samples were collected from patients undergoing cystoscopy for BCa screening or surveillance. In patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, urine samples were categorized based on tumor histopathology, size, and focality. Subjects with intermediate and high-risk BCa based on American Urological Association (AUA) guideline for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were classified as ""increased-risk""; those with no cancer and AUA low-risk BCa were classified as ""low-risk"". Urine was evaluated for ROBO1, WNT5A, CDC42BPB, ABL1, CRH, IGF2, ANXA10, and UPK1B expression. A diagnostic model to detect ""increased-risk"" BCa was created using forward logistic regression analysis of cycle threshold values. Model validation was performed with ten-fold cross-validation. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of ""increased-risk"" BCa was determined and net benefit analysis performed.  Results:   Urine samples (n = 257) were collected from 177 patients (95 screening, 76 surveillance, 6 both). There were 65 diagnoses of BCa (12 low, 22 intermediate, 31 high risk). ROBO1, CRH, and IGF2 expression correlated with ""increased-risk"" disease yielding sensitivity of 92.5% (95% CI, 84.9%-98.1%) and specificity of 73.5% (95% CI, 67.7-79.9%). The overall calculated standardized net benefit of the model was 0.81 (95%CI, 0.71-0.90).

C. difficile prevalence was determined by quantitative polymerase-chain reaction detection of Toxin genes tcdA and tcdB; microbiome composition was determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We used mixed-effect random forest modeling machine to determine bacterial taxa whose abundance is associated with C. difficile prevalence while controlling for clinical covariates including demographics, medications, and past medical history.We enrolled 167 NH elders who contributed 506 stool samples. Of the 123 elders providing multiple samples, 30 (24.4%) elders yielded multiple samples in which C. difficile was detected and 78 (46.7%) had at least one C. difficile positive sample. Elders with C. difficile positive samples were characterized by increased abundances of pathogenic or inflammatory-associated bacterial taxa and by lower abundances of taxa with anti-inflammatory or symbiotic properties. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is associated with lower prevalence of C. difficile (Odds Ratio 0.46; 95%CI, 0.22-0.99) and the abundance of bacterial species with known beneficial effects was higher in PPI users and markedly lower in elders with high C. difficile prevalence.C. difficile is prevalent among NH elders and a dysbiotic gut microbiome associates with C. difficile colonization status.

Results:   Pre- to posttreatment effect sizes were mostly moderate to large (r between 0.21 and 0.62). Associations between changes in processes and changes in outcomes were moderate to large for both, bivariate correlations (r between 0.30 and 0.54) and shared variances accounting for all three processes combined (R2 between 0.21 and 0.29).  Conclusion:   The present investigation suggests that changes in pain acceptance, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility are meaningfully associated with changes in clinical outcomes. It provides evidence on particular process-outcome associations that had not been investigated in this way before. The focus on comorbid mental disorders informs clinicians about a population of chronic pain patients who often have a severe course of illness and have seldom been studied.""","""['Ludwig Ohse', 'Ronald Burian', 'Eric Hahn', 'Hanna Burian', 'Thi Minh Tam Ta', 'Albert Diefenbacher', 'Kerem Böge']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Königin Elisabeth Herzberge, Berlin, Germany.', ' Psychologische Hochschule Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ' Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Pain Med""","""['Treatment of Chronic Pain for Adults 65 and Over: Analyses of Outcomes and Changes in Psychological Flexibility Following Interdisciplinary Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).', 'Change in fatigue in acceptance and commitment therapy-based treatment for chronic pain and its association with enhanced psychological flexibility.', 'Acceptance and commitment-based therapy for patients with psychiatric and physical health conditions in routine general hospital care - Development, implementation and outcomes.', 'A Comparative Meta-Analysis of Unidisciplinary Psychology and Interdisciplinary Treatment Outcomes Following Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Adults with Chronic Pain.', 'Processes of change in psychological flexibility in an interdisciplinary group-based treatment for chronic pain based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.']"""

The aim of this study is to report the first known human parechovirus type 3 outbreak in Portugal.  Material and methods:   Descriptive study of an outbreak that occurred between the 8th June to the 12th August 2016. Laboratory diagnosis was made by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or in stools. Genotyping was made by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction and sequencing in stool samples from infants and family members.  Results:   Human parechovirus type 3 infection was detected in seven infants, of which six were male. Median age was 23 days (5 - 52). One had seizures, with a magnetic resonance imaging scan showing white matter diffusion restriction. The mean duration of admission was 5.6 days (3 - 11), with favourable outcome in all. In three cases there were symptomatic close family members. Human parechovirus type 3 was identified in the stools of three mothers.  Discussion:   Even though human parechovirus type 3 infection has been well described in the presented age group, most Portuguese hospitals do not have this laboratory diagnosis. Our results are comparable to those obtained in other countries. Besides detection of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, there were no raised local or systemic inflammatory markers.  Conclusion:   This study reports the first known outbreak, in infants, of human parechovirus type 3 in Portugal. Although there is no specific treatment, this diagnosis can avoid unnecessary empirical antibiotic treatment and prolonged admissions.""","""['Maria Inês Linhares', 'Ana Brett', 'Lurdes Correia', 'Henriqueta Pereira', 'Cristina Correia', 'Mónica Oleastro', 'Rita De Sousa', 'Fernanda Rodrigues']""","""[' Serviço de Urgência e Unidade de Infecciologia.

However, the sampling dates of global virus sequences in the last several decades are scattered nonuniformly throughout the calendar. Such temporal structure of samples and the small effective size of viral population hampers the use of conventional methods to calculate summary statistics. Here, we define statistics that overcome this problem by correcting for the sampling-time difference in quantifying a pairwise sequence difference. A simple linear regression method jointly estimates the mutation rate and the level of sequence polymorphism, thus providing an estimate of the effective population size. It also leads to the definition of Wright's FST for arbitrary time-series data. Furthermore, as an alternative to Tajima's D statistic or the site-frequency spectrum, a mismatch distribution corrected for sampling-time differences can be obtained and compared between actual and simulated data. Application of these methods to seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses sampled between 1980 and 2017 and sequences simulated under the model of recurrent positive selection with metapopulation dynamics allowed us to estimate the synonymous mutation rate and find parameter values for selection and demographic structure that fit the observation. We found that the mutation rates of HA and PB1 segments before 2007 were particularly high and that including recurrent positive selection in our model was essential for the genealogical structure of the HA segment. Methods developed here can be generally applied to population genetic inferences using serially sampled genetic data.""","""['Myriam Croze', 'Yuseob Kim']""","""[' Division of EcoScience, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Korea.', ' Department of Life Science, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Genetics""","""['Population genetic processes affecting the mode of selective sweeps and effective population size in influenza virus H3N2.', 'Molecular epidemiology and evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 virus during winter 2012-2013 in Beijing, China.', 'Host-Specific and Segment-Specific Evolutionary Dynamics of Avian and Human Influenza A Viruses: A Systematic Review.', 'The avian-origin PB1 gene segment facilitated replication and transmissibility of the H3N2/1968 pandemic influenza virus.', 'H3N2 influenza viruses in humans: Viral mechanisms, evolution, and evaluation.']"""

Methods:   We queried the NCDB from 2004-2016 for patients with cT1N0M0 SCCA treated non-operatively with radiation, with and without chemotherapy, and at least two months of follow-up. Of the 2,959 patients meeting eligibility, 92% received chemotherapy (n = 2722) and 8% (n = 237) did not. Most patients were white (n = 2676), female (n = 2019), had private insurance (n = 1507) and were treated in a comprehensive cancer center (n = 1389). Average age was 58.5 years.  Results:   Predictors of chemotherapy omission were age > 58 years (OR 0.66, 95% CI [0.49-0.90], P = 0.0087), higher comorbidity score (OR 0.62, 95% CI [0.38-0.99], P = 0.0442), African American race (OR 0.57, 95% CI [0.36-0.90], P = 0.0156) and treatment at the start of the study period (OR 1 for years 2004-2006).

The Aldrete score is based on the evaluation of vital signs and consciousness. Cognitive functions according to the anaesthetic strategy at the time the patient is judged fit for discharge from the PACU (Aldrete's score ≥ 9) have not been previously studied. The aim of this trial was to assess the cognitive status of inpatients emerging either from desflurane or propofol anaesthesia, at the time of PACU discharge (Aldrete score ≥ 9).  Methods:   Sixty adult patients scheduled for hip or knee arthroplasty under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane or propofol anaesthesia. Patients were evaluated the day before surgery using Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Stroop Color Test and Verbal Learning Test. After surgery, the Aldrete score was checked every 5 min until reaching a score ≥ 9. At this time, the same battery of cognitive tests was applied. Each test was evaluated separately. Cognitive status was reported using a combined Z score pooling together the results of all 3 cognitive tests.  Results:   Among the 3 tests, only DSST was significantly reduced at Aldrete Score ≥ 9 in the Desflurane group. Combined Z-scores at Aldrete Score ≥ 9 were (in medians [interquartils]): - 0.2 [- 1.2;+ 0.6] and - 0.4 [- 1.1;+ 0.4] for desflurane and propofol groups respectively (P = 0.62). Cognitive dysfunction at Aldrete score ≥ 9 was observed in 3 patients in the Propofol group and in 2 patients in the Desflurane group) (P = 0.93).  Conclusion:   No difference was observed in cognitive status at Aldrete score ≥ 9 between desflurane and propofol anaesthesia. Although approximately 10% of patients still had cognitive dysfunctions, an Aldrete score ≥ 9 was associated with satisfactory cognitive function recovery in the majority of the patients after lower limb arthroplasty surgery under general anaesthesia.

This longitudinal study analyses the predictive quality of a multidimensional PAHCO assessment for levels of physical activity (PA) and their relevance for quality of life in COPD patients after pulmonary rehabilitation. At the end of an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (T2), 350 COPD patients participating in the Stay Active after Rehabilitation (STAR) study underwent assessments, including a six-factor measurement of PAHCO. PA (triaxial accelerometry) and quality of life (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire) were recorded 6 weeks (T3) and 6 months (T4) after rehabilitation. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to regress the PAHCO assessment on PA, which should, in turn, influence quality of life. In univariable analysis, five and six factors of the PAHCO model were related to PA and quality of life, respectively. Multivariate modelling showed that the predictive analyses for the PA level were dominated by the 6-minute walking test representing movement competence (0.562 ≤ |β| ≤ 0.599). Affect regulation as an indicator of control competence co-predicted quality of life at T3 and levels of PA at T4. The PA level was, in turn, significantly associated with patients' quality of life (0.306 ≤ |β| ≤ 0.388). The integrative PAHCO model may be used as a theoretical framework for predicting PA in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation.

Thus, it is crucial to understand patient perceptions of multiple myeloma and how patients value different treatment options.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory investigation into concepts that could form attributes that influence treatment choices for patients with multiple myeloma and to identify trade-offs that patients are willing to make between treatment attributes.  Methods:   In total, 30 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma from the UK, France, and Germany participated in semistructured interviews talking about their disease experience and symptoms, treatment benefits, treatment burden, perceived side effects, and benefit/risk trade-offs in treatment. The interview audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis to identify treatment and disease aspects relevant to patients.  Results:   Symptoms of fatigue and bone pain and treatment side effects of peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, and constipation were cited by patients as the most disruptive to their HRQoL. Treatment duration was reported most frequently as a major treatment burden, and patients emphasized the importance of increased life expectancy as a treatment benefit. All patients showed good understanding of benefit/risk trade-offs in treatment, and some patients expressed a preference for more convenient modes of treatment administration.  Conclusions:   Qualitative interviews identified key aspects of multiple myeloma treatment that are most important to patients.

Therefore, antibodies that allow the detection of phosphorylated versions of proteins have become important tools both preclinically in molecular cancer research, and at the clinical level by serving as tools in pathological analyses of tumors. In order to ensure reliable results, validation of the phospho-specificity of these antibodies is extremely important, since this ensures that they are indeed able to discriminate between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated versions of the protein of interest, specifically recognizing the phosphorylated variant. A recommended validation approach consists in dephosphorylating the target protein and assessing if such dephosphorylation abrogates antigen immunoreactivity when using the phospho-specific antibody. In this chapter, we describe a protocol to validate the specificity of a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes a phosphorylated variant of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in lung cancer cell lines. The protocol consists in the dephosphorylation of the Rb-containing protein lysates by treating them with bovine intestinal phosphatase, followed by assessment of the dephosphorylation by immunoblot.""","""['Wilfredo M Pedreira-García', 'Jaileene Pérez-Morales', 'Camille Chardón-Colón', 'Jennifer Cabán-Rivera', 'Pedro G Santiago-Cardona']""","""[' Biochemistry and Cancer Biology Divisions, Ponce Health Sciences University-Ponce Research Institute, Ponce, Puerto Rico.', ' Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Ponce Health Sciences University-Ponce Research Institute, Ponce, Puerto Rico.', ' Biochemistry and Cancer Biology Divisions, Ponce Health Sciences University-Ponce Research Institute, Ponce, Puerto Rico. psantiago@psm.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021;227""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb S249 together with CDK5R2/p39 overexpression are associated with impaired cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition: Implications as a potential lung cancer grading and staging biomarker.', 'Differential expressions of cyclin A and the retinoblastoma gene product in histological subtypes of lung cancer cell lines.', 'Analysis of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation by immunoblotting.', 'Optimized protocol to make phospho-specific antibodies that work.', 'Toward an in situ phospho-protein atlas: phospho- and site-specific antibody-based spatio-temporally systematized detection of phosphorylated proteins in vivo.']"""

This study evaluates the rates of readmissions within 90 days for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and bleeding among patients with cancer who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  Methods and results:   Patients treated with PCI in the years from 2010 to 2014 in the US Nationwide Readmission Database were evaluated for the influence of cancer on 90-day readmissions for AMI and bleeding. A total of 1 933 324 patients were included in the analysis (2.7% active cancer, 6.8% previous history of cancer). The 90-day readmission for AMI after PCI was higher in patients with active cancer (12.1% in lung, 10.8% in colon, 7.5% in breast, 7.0% in prostate, and 9.1% for all cancers) compared to 5.6% among patients with no cancer. The 90-day readmission for bleeding after PCI was higher in patients with active cancer (4.2% in colon, 1.5% in lung, 1.4% in prostate, 0.6% in breast, and 1.6% in all cancer) compared to 0.6% among patients with no cancer. The average time to AMI readmission ranged from 26.7 days for lung cancer to 30.5 days in colon cancer, while the average time to bleeding readmission had a higher range from 38.2 days in colon cancer to 42.7 days in breast cancer.

Ischemia-reperfusion injury produced by renal hilum clamping during surgery might have contributed to the development of AKI. In this study we tested the hypothesis that goal-directed fluid and blood pressure management may reduce AKI in patients following partial nephrectomy.  Methods:   This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. Adult patients who were scheduled to undergo partial nephrectomy were randomized into two groups. In the intervention group, goal-directed hemodynamic management was performed from renal hilum clamping until end of surgery; the target was to maintain stroke volume variation < 6%, cardiac index 3.0-4.0 L/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure > 95 mmHg with crystalloid fluids and infusion of dobutamine and/or norepinephrine. In the control group, hemodynamic management was performed according to routine practice. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within the first 3 postoperative days.  Results:   From June 2016 to January 2017, 144 patients were enrolled and randomized (intervention group, n = 72; control group, n = 72). AKI developed in 12.5% of patients in the intervention group and in 20.8% of patients in the control group; the relative reduction of AKI was 39.9% in the intervention group but the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-1.28; P = 0.180). No significant differences were found regarding AKI classification, change of estimated glomerular filtration rate over time, incidence of postoperative 30-day complications, postoperative length of hospital stay, as well as 30-day and 6-month mortality between the two groups.  Conclusion:   For patients undergoing partial nephrectomy, goal-directed circulatory management during surgery reduced postoperative AKI by about 40%, although not significantly so.

Setting:   Multicenter study enrolled former American collegiate football players from 16 different National Collegiate Athletic Association member institutions.  Participants:   Fifty-eight former American collegiate football players approximately 15 years following sport discontinuation.  Design:   Participants completed in-person evaluations including comprehensive semistructured interviews with detailed concussion history and sport history, as well as self-reported measures of depression symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Years of football participation were included as a covariate. Mediation modeling examined the degree to which sleep quality accounted for the association between repeated concussion and depression symptoms.  Results:   Within the mediation model, concussion history significantly predicted sleep quality (B = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.65; P = .002) and sleep quality significantly predicted depressive symptom severity (controlling for the effects of concussion history; B = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.24; P = .001). The association between prior concussion and depressive symptom severity was fully mediated by sleep quality. With inclusion of the indirect effects, concussion history did not predict depressive symptom severity (direct effect: B = 0.14; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.41; P = .249; indirect effect: 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.29; P = .016).  Conclusions:   Current findings raise the possibility that the greater risk of depression reported in those with a history of mTBI/concussion is mediated by sleep quality, a common sequela of mTBI.

Children are particularly vulnerable to infection and drive norovirus transmission due to their high contact rates with each other and the environment. Despite the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks, attack rates in schools and daycares remain low with the majority of students not reporting symptoms.  Methods:   We explore immunologic and epidemiologic mechanisms that may underlie epidemic norovirus transmission dynamics using a disease transmission model. Towards this end, we compared different model scenarios, including innate resistance and acquired immunity (collectively denoted 'immunity'), stochastic extinction, and an individual exclusion intervention. We calibrated our model to daycare and school outbreaks from national surveillance data.  Results:   Including immunity in the model led to attack rates that were consistent with the data. However, immunity alone resulted in the majority of outbreak durations being relatively short. The addition of individual exclusion (to the immunity model) extended outbreak durations by reducing the amount of time that symptomatic people contribute to transmission. Including both immunity and individual exclusion mechanisms resulted in simulations where both attack rates and outbreak durations were consistent with surveillance data.  Conclusions:   The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in daycare and school settings cannot be well described by a simple transmission model in which all individuals start as fully susceptible. More studies on how best to design interventions which leverage population immunity and encourage more rigorous individual exclusion may improve venue-level control measures.

Objective:   We hypothesized that white matter connectivity measured using diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) would be restructured in WTC responders with MCI versus cognitively unimpaired responders.  Methods:   Twenty responders (mean age 56; 10 MCI/10 unimpaired) recruited from an epidemiological study were characterized using NIA-AA criteria alongside controls matched on demographics (age/sex/occupation/race/education). Axial DSI was acquired on a 3T Siemen's Biograph mMR scanner (12-channel head coil) using a multi-band diffusion sequence. Connectometry examined whole-brain tract-level differences in white matter integrity. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and quantified anisotropy were extracted for region of interest (ROI) analyses using the Desikan-Killiany atlas.  Results:   Connectometry identified both increased and decreased connectivity within regions of the brains of responders with MCI identified in the corticothalamic pathway and cortico-striatal pathway that survived adjustment for multiple comparisons. MCI was also associated with higher FA values in five ROIs including in the rostral anterior cingulate; lower MD values in four ROIs including the left rostral anterior cingulate; and higher MD values in the right inferior circular insula. Analyses by cognitive domain revealed nominal associations in domains of response speed, verbal learning, verbal retention, and visuospatial learning.

Methods:   We analyzed data for 12 107 participants (mean age 50.48 years). A Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate the association of METS-IR with incident T2DM by using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); a logistic regression model was used to assess the association of 6-year METS-IR change with incident T2DM by using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. We used subgroup analyses of the association of METS-IR and its 6-year change with incident T2DM by sex, age, and baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level as well as restricted cubic splines to describe the dose-response association.  Results:   The association of METS-IR and 6-year METS-IR change with incident T2DM was significant (per SD unit increase: HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.60-2.02 for METS-IR, OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.28-1.57 and OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.44-1.76 for relative and absolute METS-IR change).

Methods:   In two online studies, we aimed to determine differences and similarities in COVID-19-related fear, generalized anxiety, depression and distress levels, as well as in the adherence to safety behaviour between the first lockdown in March and April and the second lockdown in November.  Results:   This study showed continued high psychological burden and even increased levels of depression symptoms, as well as less safety behaviour in the second phase of restrictions.  Conclusions:   The results hint at a prolonged negative impact on people's mental health and their safety behaviour despite lesser restrictions in the second lockdown, which may be interpreted as pandemic fatigue and hence strengthens the argument for a low-threshold access to psychological care.""","""['Sheila Moradian', 'Alexander Bäuerle', 'Adam Schweda', 'Venja Musche', 'Hannah Kohler', 'Madeleine Fink', 'Benjamin Weismüller', 'Anke-Verena Benecke', 'Nora Dörrie', 'Eva-Maria Skoda', 'Martin Teufel']""","""[' University of Duisburg-Essen, Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, LVR Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""J Public Health (Oxf)""","""['How do you feel during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Like most of the US, barely half of Vermont teens are up-to-date with the vaccination, with comparable deficits in New Hampshire and Maine. The rates for HPV vaccine initiation and completion are as low as 33% in rural New England. Consequently, there is a compelling responsibility to communicate its importance to unvaccinated teenagers before their risk for infection increases. Messaging in rural areas promoting HPV vaccination is compromised by community-based characteristics that include access to appropriate medical care, poor media coverage, parental and peer influence, and skepticism of science and medicine. Current strategies are predominantly passive access to literature and Internet-based information. Evidence indicates that performance-based messaging can clarify the importance of HPV vaccination to teenagers and their parents in rural areas. Increased HPV vaccination will significantly contribute to the prevention of a broadening spectrum of cancers. Reducing rurality-based inequities is a public health priority. Development of a performance-based peer-communication intervention can capture a window of opportunity to provide increasingly effective and sustained HPV protection. An effective approach can be partnering rural schools and regional health teams with a program that is nimble and scalable to respond to public health policies and practices compliant with COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications on physical distancing and interacting in the foreseeable future.""","""['Christine Finley', 'Matthew J Dugan', 'Jan Kirk Carney', 'Wendy Sue Davis', 'Thomas V Delaney', 'Victoria C Hart', 'Breena W Holmes', 'Gary S Stein', 'Robin Katrick', 'Holly Morehouse', 'Bernard Cole', 'Leslie S Bradford', 'Maureen B Boardman', 'Heidi Considine', 'Nancy C Kaplan', 'Merideth Plumpton', 'Linda Schadler', 'Jennifer J Smith', 'Kate McAllister']""","""[' Vermont Department of Health, Vermont, USA.', ' University of Vermont, Vermont, USA.', ' Vermont Child Health Improvement Program, Vermont, USA.', ' Vermont Department of Health, Vermont, USA; Vermont Child Health Improvement Program, Vermont, USA.', ' Department of Biochemistry, Robert Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA.', ' Vermont Afterschool Inc., Vermont, USA.', ' Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Maine, USA.', ' Dartmouth-Northern New England Practice-Based Research Network CO-OP, New Hampshire, USA.', ' University of Vermont, Vermont, USA; Vermonters Taking Action Against Cancer, Vermont, USA.', '0 KM Consulting, New Jersey, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021;31(""","""Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr""","""['Overcoming barriers to HPV vaccination in rural Vermont through a multicomponent peer-based approach.', 'Urban-Rural Inequities in the Parental Attitudes and Beliefs Towards Human Papillomavirus Infection, Cervical Cancer, and Human Papillomavirus Vaccine in Mysore, India.', 'Effect of a Health Care Professional Communication Training Intervention on Adolescent Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'The European response to the WHO call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.', 'Policy opportunities to increase HPV vaccination in rural communities.']"""

Yet, funeral directors have been exposed to the same risks for compassion fatigue as other caregivers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  Methods:   An online survey was spread two times to 287 employees of funeral home DELA, in Belgium. Once during the height of the first wave of COVID-19 in Belgium, and a second time at the end of the first wave. The professional quality of life-scale 5 (PROQOL-5) was used to measure compassion fatigue, which includes burnout, compassion satisfaction and secondary trauma. Non-parametric tests were performed.  Results:   In total, 104 participants answered the first survey, and 107 the second. Burnout increases from survey 1 to survey 2 (P < 0.001), while compassion satisfaction (P = 0.011) and secondary trauma decrease (P < 0.001). In survey 1, only age (P = 0.007) and gender (P = 0.040) were found to be significantly associated with secondary trauma. In survey 2, having more work experience is associated with having a higher burnout (P = 0.008) and secondary trauma (P = 0.001) score. Neither for burnout (P < 0.001), nor for secondary trauma (P < 0.001) are there any respondents in the highest category.

Therefore, PFAS may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no previous study has evaluated associations between PFAS exposure and arterial calcification.  Methods and results:   This study used data from 666 prediabetic adults enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program trial who had six PFAS quantified in plasma at baseline and two years after randomization, as well as measurements of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and ascending (AsAC) and descending (DAC) thoracic aortic calcification 13-14 years after baseline. We performed multinomial regression to test associations between PFAS and CAC categorized according to Agatston score [low (<10), moderate (11-400) and severe (>400)]. We used logistic regression to assess associations between PFAS and presence of AsAC and DAC. We adjusted models for baseline sex, age, BMI, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, education, treatment assignment (placebo or lifestyle intervention), and statin use. PFAS concentrations were similar to national means; 53.9% of participants had CAC > 11, 7.7% had AsAC, and 42.6% had DAC. Each doubling of the mean sum of plasma concentrations of linear and branched isomers of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was associated with 1.49-fold greater odds (95% CI: 1.01, 2.21) of severe versus low CAC. This association was driven mainly by the linear (n-PFOS) isomer [1.54 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.25) greater odds of severe versus low CAC]. Each doubling of mean plasma N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid concentration was associated with greater odds of CAC in a dose-dependent manner [OR = 1.26 (95% CI:1.08, 1.47) for moderate CAC and OR = 1.37 (95% CI:1.07, 1.74) for severe CAC, compared to low CAC)]. Mean plasma PFOS and n-PFOS were also associated with greater odds of AsAC [OR = 1.67 (95% CI:1.10, 2.54) and OR = 1.70 (95% CI:1.13, 2.56), respectively], but not DAC.

Methods:   Bedtime was recorded based on self-reported habitual time of going to bed in 112,198 participants from 21 countries in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Participants were prospectively followed for 9.2 years. We examined the association between bedtime and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure. Participants with a usual bedtime earlier than 10PM were categorized as 'earlier' sleepers and those who reported a bedtime after midnight as 'later' sleepers. Cox frailty models were applied with random intercepts to account for the clustering within centers.  Results:   A total of 5633 deaths and 5346 major cardiovascular events were reported. A U-shaped association was observed between bedtime and the composite outcome. Using those going to bed between 10PM and midnight as the reference group, after adjustment for age and sex, both earlier and later sleepers had a higher risk of the composite outcome (HR of 1.29 [1.22, 1.35] and 1.11 [1.03, 1.20], respectively). In the fully adjusted model where demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors (including total sleep duration) and history of diseases were included, results were greatly attenuated, but the estimates indicated modestly higher risks in both earlier (HR of 1.09 [1.03-1.16]) and later sleepers (HR of 1.10 [1.02-1.20]).

This study hypothesized that changes in both monitored and self-reported measures of sleep would relate to changes in circulating cytokine levels in an emotionally distressed population of cervical cancer survivors.  Methods:   Biospecimens, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and actigraphy were collected from cervical cancer survivors enrolled in a biobehavioral clinical trial. Longitudinal changes over a 4-month period were examined. Sleep time measured by actigraphy and PRO were analyzed for correlative changes with emotional distress and serum cytokines (n = 71).  Results:   Longitudinal change in the actigraph measure of sleep time was inversely associated with changes in depression and anxiety (test for linear trend, p = 0.02 and p = 0.05 respectively), as well as acute-phase response/pro-inflammatory cytokines (test for linear trend, p = 0.003, interleukin (IL)-2; 0.022, IL-1β; 0.0002, IL-6; and 0.049, tumor necrosis factor α). Conversely, changes in self-reported sleep problems were related to an increase in depression and anxiety (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01 respectively), the T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine IL-5 (p = 0.027), and the counter-regulatory cytokine IL-10 (0.016).  Conclusion:   This study showed that an increase in sleep time or decrease in sleep problems corresponded with a reduction in self-reported emotional distress and attenuation of pro-inflammatory, Th2, and counter-regulatory cytokines. Our results support sleep measurement as a meaningful biobehavioral variable in cancer survivorship. This study also indicates that sleep investigators should be aware that choice of methodology might influence concordance with different classes of immune parameters.""","""['Jo A Tucker', 'Kathryn Osann', 'Susie Hsieh', 'Aditi Wahi', 'Bradley J Monk', 'Lari Wenzel', 'Edward L Nelson']""","""[' Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', ' Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', ' Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', ' Arizona Oncology, US Oncology Network, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Creighton University School of Medicine, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', ' Program in Public Health, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', ' Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA. enelson@uci.edu.', ' Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA. enelson@uci.edu.', ' Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92617, USA. enelson@uci.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Int J Behav Med""","""['Sleep, emotional distress, and physical health in survivors of childhood cancer: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.', 'Concordance between self-reported sleep and actigraphy-assessed sleep in adult survivors of childhood cancer: the impact of psychological and neurocognitive late effects.', 'Relationship between social support, quality of life, and Th2 cytokines in a biobehavioral cancer survivorship trial.', 'Psychosocial telephone counseling for survivors of cervical cancer: results of a randomized biobehavioral trial.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Opposing inflammatory biomarker responses to sleep disruption in cancer patients before and during oncological therapy.', 'Exploring the links among inflammation and gut microbiome with psychoneurological symptoms and gastrointestinal toxicities in gynecologic cancers: a systematic review.', 'Translational Sleep Science in Behavioral Medicine: Introduction to this Special Issue.']"""

Understanding the health and economic factors that affect screening cost-effectiveness in different countries will help address when and where it makes most sense to screen for gastric cancer.  Methods:   We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare screening and surveillance strategies for gastric cancer in Brazil, France, Japan, Nigeria, and the United States. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how each variable affected the overall model.  Results:   In all countries, the most cost-effective strategies, measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to no screening, were screening every 10 years, surveillance of high- and low-risk patients every 5 and 10 years, respectively, and screening every 5 years. Only Japan had at least one cost-effective screening strategy. The most important variables across different screening strategies and countries were starting age of screening, cost of endoscopy, and baseline probability of local gastric cancer at time of diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Our model suggests that screening for gastric cancer is cost-effective in countries with higher incidence and lower costs of screening, but screening may still be a viable option in high-risk populations within low incidence countries.""","""['Benjamin Ascherman', 'Aaron Oh', 'Chin Hur']""","""[' Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ba2461@columbia.edu.', ' Department of Medicine, Division of General Medicine, New York Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 622 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', ' Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', ' Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Gastric Cancer""","""['Comparing endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal X-ray for gastric cancer screening in South Korea: a cost-utility analysis.', 'Cost Effectiveness of Gastric Cancer Screening According to Race and Ethnicity.', 'Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer.', 'Endoscopy for Gastric Cancer Screening Is Cost Effective for Asian Americans in the United States.', 'Screening for gastric cancer and surveillance of premalignant lesions: a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies.', 'Promising Advances in LINC01116 Related to Cancer.']"""

However, molecular mechanisms that govern this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that carbonic anhydrase 13 (CA13) plays a potential role in suppressing bone metastasis. iRFP713-labeled iCSCL-10A (iRFP-iCSCL-10A) breast cancer cells, which exhibit the hallmarks of cancer stem cells, exerted the ability of bone metastasis in hind legs after 5-week injections, whereas no metastasis was observed in control iRFP713-labeled MCF-10A (iRFP-MCF10A) cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of several genes, including metabolism-related CA13, was reduced in bone metastatic iRFP-iCSCL-10A cells. In vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrated that overexpression of CA13 in iRFP-iCSCL-10A cells suppressed migration, invasion, and bone metastasis, together with the reduction of VEGF-A and M-CSF expression. Furthermore, we found that breast cancer patients with a low CA13 expression had significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival rates compared to those with higher CA13 expression. These findings suggest that CA13 may act as a novel prognostic biomarker and would be a therapeutic candidate for the prevention of bone metastasis in breast cancer.""","""['Satomi Yogosawa', 'Jun Nakayama', 'Mayuko Nishi', 'Akihide Ryo', 'Kiyotsugu Yoshida']""","""[' Department of Biochemistry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.', ' Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Department of Microbiology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', ' Department of Biochemistry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.

Methods:   This analysis used data from the Healthy Minds Study Survey administered between 2007 and 2019, yielding a sample of 320,817 university students. Survey data were examined via descriptive analyses.  Results:   Over the last decade from 2007 to 2018-2019, there was an increase in use of nearly all classes of psychiatric medications, with reported antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], etc.) use increasing from 8.0% to 15.3%, anti-anxiety medication (benzodiazepines, buspirone, etc.) from 3.0% to 7.6%, psychostimulants from 2.1% to 6.3%, antipsychotics from 0.38% to 0.92%, and mood stabilizers from 0.8% to 2.0% (all p < 0.0001), respectively. In addition, the use of more than one category of medication at a time has increased, from 28.2% in 2007 to 40.8% in 2018-2019 (p < 0.0001). The proportion of students who received their most recent prescription for psychiatric medication from primary care providers has risen from 49.1% in 2007 to 58.8% in 2018-2019 (p < 0.0001), while the proportion receiving these prescriptions from psychiatric providers did not increase significantly and stands at 36.1% in 2018-2019. The percentage of students taking psychiatric medication without a prescription varied from year to year, starting at 11.9% in 2007 and ending at 7.7% in 2018-2019 (p < 0.0001). The proportion of students who discussed their use of psychiatric medication with their doctor or other health professional three or more times in the previous year has increased from 39.2% in 2007 to 49.5% in 2018-2019 (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The proportion of college students who have taken psychiatric medications of all categories has risen in the last decade; these students are increasingly likely to be on more than one kind of psychiatric medication and be treated by healthcare providers at a greater frequency.

We hypothesize that the free plate technique results in a lower diplopia prevalence.  Methods:   We performed a prospective study of patients who underwent BGI surgery with the free plate technique and compared them with patients from a previous study who had undergone BGI surgery with the sutured technique. Their ductions, ocular alignment and fusion range and the prevalence of diplopia were measured before surgery and at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively.  Results:   We analysed 57 free plate and 51 sutured plate patients. One year postoperatively, we found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of diplopia between the two techniques. All duction changes between baseline and 1-year follow-up were restrictions and occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the free plate than in the sutured plate group (p = 0.03; 60% versus 34%). About the ocular alignment, in the horizontal direction, a change in exodirection was more common in both groups, while in the vertical direction, a hyperdeviation of the operated eye was more common. The vertical ocular alignment change was smaller in the free plate group than in the sutured plate group (p = 0.04 at near and p = 0.02 at distance).

We compare patterns of alcohol use between Veterans Health Administration (VA) transgender and nontransgender outpatients.  Method:   National VA electronic health record data were used to identify all patients' last documented Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) screen (October 1, 2009-July 31, 2017). Transgender patients were identified using diagnostic codes. Logistic regression models estimated four past-year primary outcomes: (a) alcohol use (AUDIT-C > 0); (b) unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT-C ≥ 5); (c) high-risk alcohol use (AUDIT-C ≥ 8); and (d) heavy episodic drinking (HED; ≥6 drinks on ≥1 occasion). Two secondary diagnostic-based outcomes, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-specific conditions, were also examined.  Results:   Among 8,872,793 patients, 8,619 (0.10%) were transgender. For transgender patients, unadjusted prevalence estimates were as follows: 52.8% for any alcohol use, 6.6% unhealthy alcohol use, 2.8% high-risk use, 10.4% HED, 8.6% AUD, and 1.3% alcohol-specific conditions. After adjustment for demographic characteristics, transgender patients had lower odds of patient-reported alcohol use but higher odds of alcohol-related diagnoses compared with nontransgender patients. Differences in alcohol-related diagnoses were attenuated after adjustment for comorbid conditions and utilization.  Conclusions:   This is the largest study of patterns of alcohol use among transgender persons and among the first to directly compare patterns to nontransgender persons. Findings suggest nuanced associations with patterns of alcohol use and provide a base for further disparities research to explore alcohol use within the diverse transgender community.

We discern effects of peer influence from friend selection based on alcohol use, whether such effects vary in strength across the school year, and whether alcohol has different effects on friendship formation versus friendship maintenance.  Method:   We gathered data on friendships, alcohol use, and binge drinking from 300 residence hall students (71% female) at a large, public U.S. university. Surveys were conducted at four time points during the 2015-2016 academic year. We used a stochastic actor-oriented model to test whether alcohol use was influenced by one's friends, while simultaneously testing for friend selection based on alcohol use and related network processes.  Results:   Students were 7.0 times more likely to drink alcohol weekly if all versus none of their friends drank weekly and 6.8 times more likely to binge drink when all versus none of their friends engaged in binge drinking, after we controlled for friend selection. Alcohol use differentially affected friendship creation and maintenance in a complex manner: (a) weekly drinkers were more likely to form new friendships and dissolve existing friendships than nondrinkers and (b) similarity on drinking fostered new friendships but had no effect on friendship persistence.

We examined the moderating role that valuing cultural activities has on the relationship between positive alcohol expectancies and alcohol use and heavy drinking in a sample of Indigenous youth.  Method:   First Nation adolescents between ages 11 and 18 living on a reserve in eastern Canada (N = 106; mean age = 14.6; 50.0% female) completed a pencil-and-paper survey regarding their positive alcohol expectancies, alcohol use, and beliefs about the importance of cultural activities.  Results:   A significant interaction was identified between positive alcohol expectancies and valuing cultural activities on past-3-month alcohol use (b = -0.01, SE = 0.001, p < .001) and past-3-month heavy drinking (b = -0.01, SE = 0.001, p < .001). Simple slopes analysis revealed that the association between positive alcohol expectancies and past-3-month alcohol use and heavy drinking was significant for those with low (b = 0.06, SE = 0.007, p < .001; b = 0.07, SE = 0.008, p < .001; respectively) but not high levels of valuing cultural activities (b = 0.01, SE = 0.008, p = .12; b = 0.01, SE = 0.009, p = .08; respectively).  Conclusions:   Highly valuing cultural activities may interrupt the relationship between positive alcohol expectancies and alcohol use.

The alcohol industry has voluntary advertising guidelines to restrict the placement of alcohol advertisements only to media in which youth younger than age 21 comprise no more than 28.4% of the audience. However, the current guidelines do not account for variations in exposure among subpopulations of underage television viewers. Most youth exposure to alcohol advertising in traditional media in the United States comes from advertisements placed on cable television. Therefore, this study assessed trends among underage populations in per capita alcohol advertising exposure on cable television programs.  Method:   Advertising placement and audience data on cable television were licensed from Nielsen (New York, NY). Per capita alcohol advertising exposure (gross rating points, or GRPs) was calculated for youth ages 2-11, 12-17, and 18-20 years from 2013 to 2018. We compared relative trends in exposure between age groups.  Results:   Alcohol advertising exposure among youth ages 2-11 grew from 13,011 to 15,470 GRPs from 2013 to 2018, whereas exposure declined among youth ages 12-17 (24,663 to 17,780), and 18-20 (35,022 to 25,700). From 2016 to 2018, youth exposure to noncompliant advertising declined for all three underage groups assessed in this study.  Conclusions:   Alcohol advertising exposure among younger children grew faster than in other age groups assessed in this study. This was also the case for advertisements that complied with the alcohol industry's placement guidelines. Continued monitoring of alcohol advertising exposure among underage populations can help detect emerging trends.""","""['Elizabeth R Henehan', 'David H Jernigan', 'Craig S Ross']""","""[' Epidemiology Department, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.', ' Department of Health Law, Policy, and Management, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""J Stud Alcohol Drugs""","""['Youth Exposure to Alcohol Advertising in the United States: Assessment of Two Types of Television Ratings and Implications for Voluntary Advertising Guidelines.', 'Evaluation of monitoring youth exposure to alcohol advertising on cable television, United States 2016-19.', 'The Potential Impact of a ""No-Buy"" List on Youth Exposure to Alcohol Advertising on Cable Television.', 'Similarities Between Alcohol and Tobacco Advertising Exposure and Adolescent Use of Each of These Substances.', 'A Neurobiological Model of Alcohol Marketing Effects on Underage Drinking.']"""

Methods:   Participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database with a clinical diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an ACE-I or an ARB at any visit were selected. The primary outcome was delayed recall memory on the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised - Logical Memory IIA. Other cognitive domains were explored, including attention and psychomotor processing speed (Trail Making Test [TMT]-A and Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST]), executive function (TMT-B), and language and semantic verbal fluency (Animal Naming, Vegetable Naming, and Boston Naming Tests). Random slopes mixed-effects models with inverse probability of treatment weighting were used, yielding rate ratios (RR) or regression coefficients (B), as appropriate to the distribution of the data. Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 status and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrance were investigated as effect modifiers.  Results:   Among 1689 participants with AD, ARB use (n = 578) was associated with 9.4% slower decline in delayed recall performance over a mean follow-up of 2.28 years compared with ACE-I use (n = 1111) [RR = 1.094, p = 0.0327]; specifically, users of BBB-crossing ARBs (RR = 1.25, p = 0.002), BBB-crossing ACE-Is (RR = 1.16, p = 0.010), and non-BBB-crossing ARBs (RR = 1.20, p = 0.005) had better delayed recall performance over time compared with non-BBB-crossing ACE-I users. An interaction with APOE ε4 status (drug × APOE × time RR = 1.196, p = 0.033) emerged; ARBs were associated with better delayed recall scores over time than ACE-Is in non-carriers (RR = 1.200, p = 0.003), but not in carriers (RR = 1.003, p = 0.957). ARB use was also associated with better performance over time on the TMT-A (B = 2.023 s, p = 0.0004) and the DSST (B = 0.573 symbols, p = 0.0485), and these differences were significant among APOE ε4 non-carriers (B = 4.066 s, p = 0.0004; and B = 0.982 symbols, p = 0.0230; respectively). Some differences were seen also in language and verbal fluency among APOE ε4 non-carriers.

The programme has increased its services and resources to strengthen the accurate and early detection of TB. It is important to estimate the cost of TB diagnosis in India considering the advancement and implementation of new diagnostic tools under the NTEP. The objective of this study was to estimate the unit costs of providing TB diagnostic services at different levels of public health facilities with different algorithms implemented under the NTEP in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, South India.  Methods:   This costing study was conducted from the perspective of the health system. This study used only secondary data and information that were available in the public domain. Data were collected with the approval of health authorities. The patient's diagnostic path from the point of registration until the final diagnosis was considered in the costing exercise. The unit costs of different diagnostic tools used in the NTEP implemented by Chennai Corporation were calculated.  Results:   We estimated the unit cost of the eight laboratory tests (Ziehl-Neelsen [ZN], fluorescence microscopy [FM], x-ray, digital x-ray, gene Xpert MTB/RIF (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] that identifies rifampicin resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis) Mycobacterium Tuberculosis/Rifampicin [MTB/RIF], mycobacteria growth indicator tube [MGIT], line probe assay [LPA] and Lowenstein Jensen [LJ] culture) for diagnosis of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. The unit costs included fixed and variable costs for smear examination by ZN microscopy (₹ [Indian Rupee] 326 [US${\$}$4.72], FM (₹104 [US${\$}$1.5]), x-ray (₹218 [US${\$}$3.15]), digital X-ray (₹281 [US${\$}$4.07]), gene Xpert MTB/RIF (₹1137 [US${\$}$16.47]), MGIT (₹7038 [US${\$}$102]), LPA (₹6448 [US${\$}$93.44]) and LJ culture (₹4850 [US${\$}$70.28]). Out of 10 diagnostic algorithms used for TB diagnosis, algorithms using only smear microscopy had the lowest cost, followed by smear microscopy with x-ray for drug-sensitive TB (₹104 [US${\$}$1.5] to ₹544 [US${\$}$7.88]). Diagnostic algorithms for drug-resistant TB involving LPA and gene Xpert MTB/RIF were the most expensive.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a low molecular weight peptide hormone with similar metabolic activity and structural characteristics of proinsulin, which exerts its biological effects by binding with its receptor. Emerging evidence has shown that IGF1 is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, but its special role in establishment and maintenance of pregnancy is largely unknown. Here, we found that the expression of IGF1 in the decidua was significantly higher than that in the endometrium. Additionally, decidua from women with normal pregnancy had high levels of IGF1 compared with that from women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous miscarriage. Estrogen and progesterone led to the increase of IGF1 in DSCs through upregulating the expression of WISP2. Recombinant IGF1 or DSCs-derived IGF1 increased the survival, reduced the apoptosis of DSCs, and downregulated the cytotoxicity of decidual NK cells (dNK) through interaction with IGF1R. These data suggest that estrogen and progesterone stimulate the growth of DSCs and impair the cytotoxicity of dNK possibly by the WISP2/IGF1 signaling pathway.""","""['Jia-Wei Shi', 'Hui-Li Yang', 'Zhen-Zhen Lai', 'Hui-Hui Shen', 'Xue-Yun Qin', 'Xue-Min Qiu', 'Yan Wang', 'Jiang-Nan Wu', 'Ming-Qing Li']""","""["" Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, NHC Key Lab of Reproduction Regulation (Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research), Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Clinical Epidemiology, Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", "" Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Reproduction""","""['Pigment epithelium-derived factor, a novel decidual natural killer cells-derived factor, protects decidual stromal cells via anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in early pregnancy.', 'Decidual stromal cells promote the differentiation of CD56bright CD16- NK cells by secreting IL-24 in early pregnancy.', 'Trophoblast-derived CXCL12 promotes CD56bright CD82- CD29+ NK cell enrichment in the decidua.', 'Human Decidual Stromal Cells as a Component of the Implantation Niche and a Modulator of Maternal Immunity.', 'miRNAs in decidual NK cells: regulators worthy of attention during pregnancy.', 'Transcriptomic profiling of canine decidualization and effects of antigestagens on decidualized dog uterine stromal cells.', 'An IGF1-expressing endometrial stromal cell population is associated with human decidualization.', 'Comprehensive Exploration of Tumor Microenvironment Modulation Based on the ESTIMATE Algorithm in Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Microenvironment.']"""

Here, we conducted a post hoc pharmacogenomic study of COLCOT with the aim to identify genetic predictors of the efficacy and safety of treatment with colchicine.  Methods:   There were 1522 participants of European ancestry from the COLCOT trial available for the pharmacogenomic study of COLCOT trial. The pharmacogenomic study's primary cardiovascular end point was defined as for the main trial, as time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina requiring coronary revascularization. The safety end point was time to the first report of gastrointestinal events. Patients' DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Global Screening array followed by imputation. We performed a genome-wide association study in colchicine-treated patients.  Results:   None of the genetic variants passed the genome-wide association study significance threshold for the primary cardiovascular end point conducted in 702 patients in the colchicine arm who were compliant to medication. The genome-wide association study for gastrointestinal events was conducted in all 767 patients in the colchicine arm and found 2 significant association signals, one with lead variant rs6916345 (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.52-2.35], P=7.41×10-9) in a locus which colocalizes with Crohn disease, and one with lead variant rs74795203 (hazard ratio, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.82-3.47]; P=2.70×10-8), an intronic variant in gene SEPHS1. The interaction terms between the genetic variants and treatment with colchicine versus placebo were significant.

This study employs longitudinal neuro-imaging, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), resting state-fMRI (rs-fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to determine mechanisms and predictors of EAT outcomes for PTSD.  Method:   Nineteen veterans with PTSD completed eight weekly group sessions of EAT undergoing multimodal MRI assessments before and after treatment. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up.  Results:   At post-treatment patients showed a significant increase in caudate functional connectivity (FC) and reduction in the gray matter density of the thalamus and the caudate. The increase of caudate FC was positively associated with clinical improvement seen immediately at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. In addition, higher baseline caudate FC was associated with greater PTSD symptom reduction post-treatment.

Results:   In the time up to and after MCI diagnosis, incident MCI participants opened their pillbox later in the day (by 19 min/mo; β=0.46, P<0.001) and had increased day-to-day variability in the first pillbox opening over time (by 4 min/mo) as compared with stable cognitively intact participants (β=4.0, P=0.003).  Discussion:   Individuals who transitioned to MCI opened their pillboxes later in the day and were more variable in their medication-taking habits.

As long-term surveillance on norovirus gastroenteritis is scarce in western China, this study aims to update the epidemiological knowledge of norovirus gastroenteritis and to characterize the genotypes of norovirus strains.  Methods:   Stool samples were collected from hospitalized children under 5 years old with gastroenteritis in Chengdu, China. All samples were tested for norovirus as well as rotavirus, sapovirus, enteric adenovirus, and astrovirus by real-time RT-PCR. RdRp and VP1 genes were sequenced in norovirus-positive samples to investigate viral phylogenies.  Results:   Of the 1181 samples collected from 2015 to 2019, 242 (20.5%) were positive for norovirus. Among norovirus-positive cases, 65 cases had co-infection with another virus; norovirus/enteric adenovirus was most frequently detected (50.8%, 33/65). The highest positive rate was observed in children aged 13-18 months (23.7%, 68/287). Norovirus infection peaked in autumn (36.6%, 91/249), followed by summer (20.3%, 70/345). Pearson correlation analysis showed significant correlation between the norovirus-positive rate and humidity (r = 0.773, P < 0.05). GII.4 Sydney 2012 [P31] (48.5%, 79/163) and GII.3 [P12] (35.6%, 58/163) were the dominant norovirus strains.  Conclusions:   Norovirus has become one of the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old in western China.

The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which neurosurgeons are faced with issues pertaining to this mistreatment.  Methods:   A survey consisting of fourteen questions was distributed among members of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). The survey consisted of three parts: 1) demographics; 2) exposure to mistreatment; 3) experienced burnout symptoms.  Results:   In total 503 out of the 5665 approached CNS members filled in a survey (response rate 8.9 %). Respondents consisted for 85.9 % out of neurosurgeons and for 13.9 % out of residents. Overall, 61.4 % of the respondents was a victim of form of abusive behavior, while 47.9 % was a victim of at least one form of discrimination. Most reported sources of these mistreatments were other neurosurgeons or (family of) patients. Overall, 49.9 % of the respondents experienced burnout symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female respondents had higher odds of being a victim of abuse (OR 2.5, 95 % CI 1.4-4.6). Female respondents (OR 19.8, 95 % CI 8.9-43.9) and ethnic minorities (OR 3.8, 95 % CI 2.3-6.2) had higher odds of being a victim of discrimination.

All 2010–2019 ICSRs (Individual Case Safety Reports) with the PT term “hypoglycemia” and tramadol were included. Two disproportionality analyses were performed: 1/after inclusion of all reports, 2/after exclusion of concomitant hypoglycemic drugs. Results are expressed as Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR; 95% CI). Among 10 038 436 ICSRs, 97 639 were included. In comparison with codeine, a significant association was found between tramadol use and reports of hypoglycemia before [ROR = 1.54 (1.43–1.66)] or after [ROR = 1.43 (1.31–1.56)] exclusion of hypoglycemic drugs. Tramadol use is associated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia reports than codeine, the other step 2 analgesic, in the presence as well as in the absence of other hypoglycemic drugs.

Here we investigate PPE sterilization using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD), in a sealed environment chamber. The efficacy of sterilization by iHP was assessed using bacterial spores in biological indicator assemblies. After one or more iHP treatments, five models of N95 masks from three manufacturers were assessed for retention of function based on their ability to form an airtight seal (measured using a quantitative fit test) and filter aerosolized particles. Filtration testing was performed at a university lab and at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain filtration efficiency up to ten cycles, the maximum number tested to date.

Objective:   To investigate the effectiveness of systematic echocardiographic screening in combination with secondary antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cluster randomized clinical trial included students 9 to 16 years of age attending public and private schools in urban and rural areas of the Sunsari district in Nepal that had been randomly selected on November 17, 2012. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed between January 7, 2016, and January 3, 2019.  Interventions:   In the experimental group, children underwent systematic echocardiographic screening followed by secondary antibiotic prophylaxis in case they had echocardiographic evidence of latent rheumatic heart disease. In the control group, children underwent no echocardiographic screening.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prevalence of the composite of definite or borderline rheumatic heart disease according to the World Heart Federation criteria in experimental and control schools as assessed 4 years after intervention.  Results:   A total of 35 schools were randomized to the experimental group (n = 19) or the control group (n = 16). After a median of 4.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4.0-4.5 years), 17 of 19 schools in the experimental group (2648 children; median age at follow-up, 12.1 years; IQR, 10.3-12.5 years; 1308 [49.4%] male) and 15 of 16 schools in the control group (1325 children; median age at follow-up, 10.6 years; IQR, 10.0-12.5 years; 682 [51.5%] male) underwent echocardiographic follow-up. The prevalence of definite or borderline rheumatic heart disease was 10.8 per 1000 children (95% CI, 4.7-24.7) in the control group and 3.8 per 1000 children (95% CI, 1.5-9.8) in the experimental group (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11-1.07; P = .06). The prevalence in the experimental group at baseline had been 12.9 per 1000 children (95% CI, 9.2-18.1).

Methods:   Fifty-six patients with right temporal lower-grade glioma were divided into GRE (n = 28) and non-GRE groups. Twenty-eight healthy subjects were recruited after matching age, sex, and education level. Sensorimotor, visual, language, and left executive control networks were applied to generate functional connectivity matrices, and their topological properties were investigated.  Results:   No significant alterations in functional connectivity were found. The least significant discovery test revealed differences only in the language network. The shortest path length, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and vulnerability were greater in the non-GRE group than in the other groups. The nodal efficiencies of two nodes (mirror areas to Broca and Wernicke) were weaker in the non-GRE group than in the other groups.

Methods:   We developed the LDL-C PRS using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression in 377 286 White British participants from UK Biobank and tested its association with LDL-C according to FH variant carrier status in another 41 748 whole-exome sequenced individuals. Next, we tested for an enrichment of FH variant carriers among individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia and low LDL-C PRS. Last, we contrasted the effect of the LDL-C PRS, measured LDL-C and FH variant carrier status on risk of ischemic heart disease among 3010 cases and 38 738 controls.  Results:   Among the 41 748 whole-exome sequenced White British individuals, 1-SD increase in the LDL-C PRS was associated with elevated LDL-C among both FH variant carriers (0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.47] mmol/L) and noncarriers (0.42 [95% CI, 0.42-0.43] mmol/L). Among individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia, FH variant carriers were enriched in those with a low LDL-C PRS (odds ratio, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.66-2.71] per SD). Each SD increase in the LDL-C PRS was associated with risk of ischemic heart disease to the comparable magnitude as measured LDL-C (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.20-1.29] and odds ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.23], respectively). The LDL-C PRS was not strongly associated with other traditional ischemic heart disease risk factors.  Conclusions:   An LDL-C PRS could be used to identify individuals with a higher probability of harboring FH variants. The association between ischemic heart disease and the LDL-C PRS was comparable to measured LDL-C, likely because the PRS reflects lifetime exposure to LDL-C levels.""","""['Haoyu Wu', 'Vincenzo Forgetta', 'Sirui Zhou', 'Sahir R Bhatnagar', 'Guillaume Paré', 'J Brent Richards']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health (H.W., S.Z., S.R.B., J.B.R.), Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, QC, Canada.', ' Center for Clinical Epidemiology (H.W., V.F., S.Z., J.B.R.), Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, QC, Canada.', ' Department of Diagnostic Radiology (S.R.B.) and Department of Human Genetics (J.B.R.), McGill University, Montréal, QC, Canada.', ' Population Health Research Institute, David Braley Cardiac, Vascular and Stroke Research Institute, Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences, ON, Canada (G.P.).', ' Departments of Pathology and Molecular Medicine (G.P.), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ' Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (G.P.), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ' Department of Biochemistry (G.P.), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', "" Department of Twin Research, King's College London, United Kingdom (J.B.R.).""]""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Circ Genom Precis Med""","""['Relationship of Familial Hypercholesterolemia and High Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol to Ischemic Stroke: Copenhagen General Population Study.', 'Polygenic Contribution to Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Cardiovascular Risk in Monogenic Familial Hypercholesterolemia.', 'Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Utility of Sequencing Familial Hypercholesterolemia Genes in Patients With Severe Hypercholesterolemia.', 'ABCG5 and ABCG8 genetic variants in familial hypercholesterolemia.', 'Association of Monogenic vs Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia With Risk of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Polygenic risk score for hypercholesterolemia in a Brazilian familial hypercholesterolemia cohort.', 'Lipoprotein profiles of fat distribution and its association with insulin sensitivity.', 'LDL-C Concentrations and the 12-SNP LDL-C Score for Polygenic Hypercholesterolaemia in Self-Reported South Asian, Black and Caribbean Participants of the UK Biobank.', 'Successful Genetic Screening and Creating Awareness of Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Other Heritable Dyslipidemias in the Netherlands.', 'Polygenic risk scores for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and familial hypercholesterolemia.']"""

The extensive pressure of managing health care during the pandemic establishes the need for rapid implementation of telemedicine. Across our large statewide practice of 640 practitioners at 221 sites of service, an aggressive multidisciplinary telemedicine strategy was implemented in March by coordinating and training many different parts of our healthcare delivery system. From March to September, telemedicine grew to serve 15%-20% of new patients and 20%-25% of established patients, permitting the practice to implement safety protocols and reduce volumes in clinic while continuing to manage the acute and chronic care needs of our patient population. We surveyed practice leaders, queried for qualitative feedback, and established 76% were satisfied with the platform. The common challenges for patients were the first-time use and technology function, and patients were, in general, grateful and happy to have the option to visit their clinicians on a telemedicine platform. In addition to conducting new and established visits remotely, telemedicine allows risk assessments, avoidance of hospitalization, family education, psychosocial care, and improved pharmacy support. The implementation has limitations including technical complexity; increased burden on patients and staff; and broadband access, particularly in rural communities. For telemedicine to improve as a solution to enhance the longitudinal care of patients with cancer, payment coverage policies need to continue after the pandemic, technologic adoption needs to be easy for patients, and broadband access in rural areas needs to be a policy priority. Further research to optimize the patient and clinician experience is required to continue to make progress.""","""['Debra A Patt', 'Lalan Wilfong', 'Sara Toth', 'Stephanie Broussard', 'Kristen Kanipe', 'Jason Hammonds', 'Victoria Allen', 'Beatrice Mautner', 'Nakedra Campbell', 'Ajay K Dubey', 'Nini Wu', 'Marcus Neubauer', 'Ben S Jones', 'R Steven Paulson']""","""[' Texas Oncology, Austin, TX.', ' US Oncology, The Woodlands, TX.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['Telemedicine for cancer care: implementation across a multicenter community oncology practice.', 'Implementation of Telemedicine in a Tertiary Hospital-Based Ambulatory Practice in Detroit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study.', 'Practice-Level Variation in Telemedicine Use in a Pediatric Primary Care Network During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Analysis and Survey Study.', 'Digitally-Enabled Remote Care for Cancer Patients: Here to Stay.', 'COVID-19 and supportive cancer care: key issues and opportunities.', '""Double whammy"": a rapid review of rural vs urban psychosocial cancer experiences and telehealth service in five countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Access to telehealth services for colorectal cancer patients in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.', ""Breast Medical Oncologists' Perspectives of Telemedicine for Breast Cancer Care: A Survey Study."", 'Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult Cancer Patients through Telehealth Adoption: A Systematic Review.', ""Patients' Experiences with Cancer Care: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.""]"""

However, little is known about the pathways through which lifetime parent traumatic events (PTEs) influence their adolescents' internalizing symptoms. Our study examined whether PD mediates the association between PTE and adolescent depressive and anxious symptoms among youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS).  Methods:   We used baseline data from a randomized effectiveness trial of collaborative care for treatment of persistent postconcussive symptoms among sports-injured adolescents aged 11-18 years. Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited from pediatric clinics throughout western Washington. Eligible adolescents had three or more PPCS that lasted for at least 1 month but <9 months and spoke English. Of 1,870 potentially eligible adolescents, 1,480 (79%) were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the eligible 390 adolescents, 189 (49%) declined to participate/consent. Participants included 200 parent-adolescent dyads (adolescent Mage = 14.7 years, SD = 1.7). Parent respondents were mostly female (83%) and mothers (81%). Adolescents reported on their depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) and anxious symptoms (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-Short Version [anxiety subscale]) and parents reported on their depressive symptoms (M = 3.7, SD = 3.7; PHQ-9).  Results:   Mediation analyses revealed two (out of four) significant indirect effects of PTE on both adolescent and parent report of depressive symptoms, but not anxiety.  Conclusions:   This study elucidates one pathway (PD) through which PTE history influences adolescent depressive symptoms, supporting a two-generation approach to pediatric patient care for youth experiencing PPCS.""","""['Lyscha A Marcynyszyn', 'Carolyn A McCarty', 'Frederick P Rivara', 'Ashleigh M Johnson', 'Jin Wang', 'Douglas F Zatzick']""","""["" Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development, Seattle Children's Research Institute."", ' Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington.', ' Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, University of Washington.', ' Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""J Pediatr Psychol""","""['Effect of Collaborative Care on Persistent Postconcussive Symptoms in Adolescents: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Child- compared with parent-report ratings on psychosocial measures following a mild traumatic brain injury among youth with persistent post-concussion symptoms.', 'Psychological Resilience as a Predictor of Symptom Severity in Adolescents With Poor Recovery Following Concussion.', ""Do Injured Adolescent Athletes and Their Parents Agree on the Athletes' Level of Psychologic and Physical Functioning?"", 'Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents.']"""

However, olfaction has been evaluated solely on reported symptoms, after COVID-19 diagnosis, and in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases, but rarely has it been assessed in prospectively unselected populations.  Objective:   To evaluate the diagnostic value of a semiobjective olfactory test developed to assess patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction prior to testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients attending a COVID-19 screening facility.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective diagnostic study with participants and observers blinded to COVID-19 status was conducted in a COVID-19 screening center of a tertiary university hospital in France from March 23 to April 22, 2020. Participants were 854 consecutively included health care workers or outpatients with symptoms or with close contact with an index case. Exclusion criteria were prior chemosensory dysfunction, testing inability, or contraindications (n = 45).  Main outcomes and measures:   Participants were interviewed to ascertain their symptoms and then underwent Clinical Olfactory Dysfunction Assessment (CODA), an ad hoc test developed for a simple and fast evaluation of olfactory function. This assessment followed a standardized procedure in which participants identified and rated the intensity of 3 scents (lavender, lemongrass, and mint) to achieve a summed score ranging from 0 to 6. The COVID-19 status was assessed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected via nasopharyngeal swab (reference standard) to calculate the diagnostic values of patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction and CODA.  Results:   Of 809 participants, the female to male sex ratio was 2.8, and the mean (SD) age was 41.8 (13.0) years (range, 18-94 years). All participants, if symptomatic, had mild disease at the time of testing, and 58 (7.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 20 of 58 participants (34.5%) with confirmed COVID-19 vs 29 of 751 participants (3.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 (absolute difference, 30.6% [95% CI, 18.3%-42.9%]). Olfactory dysfunction, either self-reported or clinically ascertained (CODA score ≤3), yielded similar sensitivity (0.31 [95% CI, 0.20-0.45] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.48]) and specificity (0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.98) vs 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]) for COVID-19 diagnosis. Concordance was high between reported and clinically tested olfactory dysfunction, with a Gwet AC1 of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Of 19 participants, 15 (78.9%) with both reported olfactory dysfunction and a CODA score of 3 or lower were confirmed to have COVID-19. The CODA score also revealed 5 of 19 participants (26.3%) with confirmed COVID-19 who had previously unperceived olfactory dysfunction.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this prospective diagnostic study of outpatients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19, systematically assessed anamnesis and clinical testing with the newly developed CODA were complementary and specific for chemosensory dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction was suggestive of COVID-19, particularly when clinical testing confirmed anamnesis.

Methods: Using data from Waves I (1994-1995; participants ages 12-18 years) and V (2016-2018; participants ages 34-42 years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 10,685), we examined adolescent and adult demographic, mental and physical health, substance use, and behavioral characteristics associated with past 30-day prescription opioid use only, misuse only, and both use and misuse to no recent use or misuse in adulthood. Results: Overall, 2.3% of adult participants reported past 30-day prescription opioid use only, 6.3% reported past 30-day misuse only, and 1.3% reported both prescribed use and misuse in the past 30 days. Physical health conditions in adolescence and adulthood were most common among those reporting use only and both use and misuse. Mental health conditions, other substance use, and delinquent behaviors in adolescence and adulthood were most common among those reporting misuse only and both use and misuse.

Results:   Five longitudinal patterns of insomnia characterized the majority of the sample: ""No Insomnia"" (no insomnia symptoms at any timepoint; 31%), ""Deployment-related Insomnia"" (no pre-deployment insomnia, developed insomnia symptoms during deployment and recovered; 40%), ""Incident Insomnia"" (development insomnia during or shortly after deployment that did not remit; 14%), ""Chronic Insomnia"" (insomnia both pre- and post-deployment; 11%), and ""Other Insomnia"" (reported insomnia at ≥1 timepoint, but no clear pattern across the deployment cycle; 4%). Several pre-deployment factors were predictive of insomnia trajectories, including lifetime major depressive episodes, traumatic brain injury history, posttraumatic stress disorder, and past year personal life stressors.  Conclusions:   Distinct longitudinal patterns of insomnia were identified, with more than half of the sample reporting insomnia at some point in the deployment cycle. Identifying mental health conditions that are associated with different insomnia patterns prior to deployment can inform targeted interventions to reduce long-term sleep difficulty.""","""['Katherine E Miller', 'Christine M Ramsey', 'Elaine M Boland', 'Elizabeth A Klingaman', 'Philip Gehrman']""","""[' Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center, Corporal Michael J.

We investigated the epidemiology of noroviruses among hospitalized children at two hospitals in East Java, Indonesia. Stool samples were collected from 966 children with AGE during September 2015-July 2019. All samples were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the amplification of both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the capsid genes of noroviruses. The genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analyses. In 2015-2019, noroviruses were detected in 12.3% (119/966) of the samples. Children <2 years old showed a significantly higher prevalence than those ≥2 years old (P = 0.01). NoV infections were observed throughout the year, with the highest prevalence in December. Based on our genetic analyses of RdRp, GII.[P31] (43.7%, 31/71) was the most prevalent RdRp genotype, followed by GII.[P16] (36.6%, 26/71). GII.[P31] was a dominant genotype in 2016 and 2018, whereas GII.[P16] was a dominant genotype in 2015 and 2017. Among the capsid genotypes, the most predominant norovirus genotype from 2015 to 2018 was GII.4 Sydney_2012 (33.6%, 40/119). The most prevalent genotype in each year was GII.13 in 2015, GII.4 Sydney_2012 in 2016 and 2018, and GII.3 in 2017. Based on the genetic analyses of RdRp and capsid sequences, the strains were clustered into 13 RdRp/capsid genotypes; 12 of them were discordant, e.g., GII.4 Sydney[P31], GII.3[P16], and GII.13[P16]. The predominant genotype in each year was GII.13[P16] in 2015, GII.4 Sydney[P31] in 2016, GII.3[P16] in 2017, and GII.4 Sydney[P31] in 2018.

Yunnan Province, widely covered by flourishing vegetation and mainly relying on farming husbandry, is abundant with Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the viral profile present in R. microplus parasitizing on cattle in Yunnan Province. In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan. These viruses consist of single-stranded, circular and segmented sense RNAs, showing a greatly diversity in genomic organization. Furthermore, continuous epidemiological survey among ticks reveals broad prevalence of three viruses (Yunnan mivirus 1, Wuhan tick vrius 1 and YN tick-associated phlebovirus 1) and two possible prevalent viruses including a flavivirus-like segmented virus (Jingmen tick virus) and a bovine hokovirus 2 in Yunnan. Serological investigation among cattle indicates that these identified viruses may be infectious to cattle and can elicit corresponding antibody. Our findings on R. microplus-associated viral community will contribute to the prevention of viral disease and tracking the viral evolution. Further analysis is needed to better elucidate the pathogenicity and natural circulation of these viruses.""","""['Junming Shi', 'Shu Shen', 'Hui Wu', 'Yunzhi Zhang', 'Fei Deng']""","""[' State Key Laboratory of Virology and National Virus Resource Center, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China.', ' University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', ' Institute of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Dali University, Dali, 671000, China.', ' Xianning Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xinanning, 437000, China.', ' Institute of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Dali University, Dali, 671000, China. zhangyunzhi1818@163.com.', ' State Key Laboratory of Virology and National Virus Resource Center, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China. df@wh.iov.cn.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Virol Sin""","""['Viral diversity of Rhipicephalus microplus parasitizing cattle in southern Brazil.', 'Identification of Tick-Borne Pathogens and Genotyping of Coxiella burnetii in Rhipicephalus microplus in Yunnan Province, China.', 'Metatranscriptomic virome assessment of Rhipicephalus microplus from Colombia.', 'Review of cattle ticks (Acari, Ixodida) in Ivory Coast and geographic distribution of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, an emerging tick in West Africa.', 'Immunological control of ticks and tick-borne diseases that impact cattle health and production.', 'Detection and Characterization of Alongshan Virus in Ticks and Tick Saliva from Lower Saxony, Germany with Serological Evidence for Viral Transmission to Game and Domestic Animals.', 'Diversity of RNA viruses of three dominant tick species in North China.', 'Extensive diversity of RNA viruses in ticks revealed by metagenomics in northeastern China.', 'Jingmenviruses: Ubiquitous, understudied, segmented flavi-like viruses.', 'Metatranscriptomics Reveals the Diversity of the Tick Virome in Northwest China.']"""

Methods Participants were 889 (51.2% male; 62.3% White) children who were born <28 weeks gestation. Child and family demographic data were collected at birth. When the children were 10, parents (n = 871) and teachers (n = 640) rated the level of anxiety and depression in children through the Child Symptom Inventory-4. Child academic functioning was assessed via the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-III. Parents completed questionnaires about child academic functioning and physical health issues. Data analyses were conducted with multivariate linear modeling. Results Level of prematurity was significantly related to both parent and teacher reports of anxiety. Public health insurance and individualized education program (IEP) status were associated with both parent and teacher reports of depression. Hispanic ethnicity, public insurance, IEP status, and asthma were significantly associated with both parent-reported anxiety and depression. Gross motor impairment was associated with parent-reported anxiety and teacher-reported depression.

Methods:   We use a simulation framework that generates data on full GWAS for two traits under a realistic model for effect-size distribution coherent with the heritability, co-heritability and polygenicity typically observed for complex traits. We further use recent data generated from GWAS of 38 biomarkers in the UK Biobank and performed down sampling to investigate trends in estimates of causal effects of these biomarkers on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Results:   Simulation studies show that weighted mode and MRMix are the only two methods that maintain the correct type I error rate in a diverse set of scenarios. Between the two methods, MRMix tends to be more powerful for larger GWAS whereas the opposite is true for smaller sample sizes. Among the other methods, random-effect IVW (inverse-variance weighted method), MR-Robust and MR-RAPS (robust adjust profile score) tend to perform best in maintaining a low mean-squared error when the InSIDE assumption is satisfied, but can produce large bias when InSIDE is violated. In real-data analysis, some biomarkers showed major heterogeneity in estimates of their causal effects on the risk of T2D across the different methods and estimates from many methods trended in one direction with increasing sample size with patterns similar to those observed in simulation studies.  Conclusion:   The relative performance of different MR methods depends heavily on the sample sizes of the underlying GWAS, the proportion of valid instruments and the validity of the InSIDE assumption. Down-sampling analysis can be used in large GWAS for the possible detection of bias in the MR methods.""","""['Guanghao Qi', 'Nilanjan Chatterjee']""","""[' Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ' Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Int J Epidemiol""","""['The use of two-sample methods for Mendelian randomization analyses on single large datasets.', 'Robust inference in summary data Mendelian randomization via the zero modal pleiotropy assumption.', 'Assessment of causality between serum gamma-glutamyltransferase and type 2 diabetes mellitus using publicly available data: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Bias in two-sample Mendelian randomization when using heritable covariable-adjusted summary associations.', 'Assessing the suitability of summary data for two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses using MR-Egger regression: the role of the I2 statistic.', 'Reciprocal causation mixture model for robust Mendelian randomization analysis using genome-scale summary data.', 'Likelihood-based Mendelian randomization analysis with automated instrument selection and horizontal pleiotropic modeling.', 'Welch-weighted Egger regression reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy in Mendelian randomization.', 'Investigating Causal Relationships Between Psychiatric Traits and Intracranial Aneurysms: A Bi-directional Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Selection into shift work is influenced by educational attainment and body mass index: a Mendelian randomization study in the UK Biobank.']"""

CD147 is known to be functioning in cell invasion. In this study, we showed that CD147 was translocated from the cell membrane to the mitochondria in advanced melanoma. Melanoma patients with CD147 localized to the mitochondria confer a worse prognosis. The mitochondrial CD147 levels are correlated with the invasion potential of various melanoma cell lines as well as mitochondrial energy metabolism. Depletion of CD147 decreased the activity of mitochondrial complex V. STRING analysis for protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) in CD147-depleted melanoma cells showed that mitochondrial proteins HSP60 and ATP5B, a subunit of mitochondrial complex V, were node proteins. HSP60 upregulation was correlated with a worse prognosis of melanoma patients. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay indicates that CD147 interacts with HSP60. These data suggested that mitochondrial CD147 may prompt HSP60 to activate ATP5B, thereby promoting the mitochondrial aerobic oxidation and the invasive abilities of melanoma cells. Correlation analysis of the data acquired from patients was helpful to draw a 5-year survival curve for patients who screened positive and negative for mitochondrial CD147.

Objectives:   To determine (1) aspects of care that patients and families valued during their ICU encounter, (2) outcomes that patients and families prioritized after hospital discharge, and (3) outcomes perceived as equivalent to or worse than death.  Methods:   Semistructured interviews (n = 49) of former patients of an urban, academic medical ICU and their family members. Two investigators reviewed all transcripts line by line to identify key concepts. Codes were created and defined in a codebook with decision rules for their application and were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.  Results:   Salient themes were identified and grouped into 2 major categories: (1) processes of care within the ICU- communication, patient comfort, and a sense that the medical team was ""doing everything"" (ie, providing exhaustive medical care) and (2) patient and surrogate outcomes after the ICU-survival, quality of life, physical function, and cognitive function. Several outcomes were deemed worse than death: severe cognitive/physical disability, dependence on medical machinery/equipment, and severe/constant pain.  Conclusion:   Although survival was important, most participants qualified this preference.

Children with stunting were more likely than controls to have lower mean peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-8h) of rifampin (RIF) and pyrazinamide (PZA), as well as a higher frequency of Cmax below the normal range. Wasting and underweight were associated with lower mean ethambutol (EMB) Cmax and AUC0-8h.CONCLUSIONS: The current WHO-recommended dosages were associated with lower plasma exposure of RIF, PZA and EMB in children with stunting, wasting and underweight. Anti-TB drugs dosing models for children may need to include height.""","""['N A H Seneadza', 'S Antwi', 'H Yang', 'A Enimil', 'A Dompreh', 'L Wiesner', 'C A Peloquin', 'M Lartey', 'M Lauzardo', 'A Kwara']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, Department of Community Health, University of Ghana Medical School, Kumasi, Ghana.', ' Directorate of Child Health, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana, Department of Child Health, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.', ' Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', ' Directorate of Child Health, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana.', ' Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', ' Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', ' Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Ghana Medical School, Accra, Ghana, Fevers Unit, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana.', ' Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Int J Tuberc Lung Dis""","""['Observations on malnutrition and anti-TB drugs in Ghana.', 'Reply to: Observations on malnutrition and anti-TB drugs in Ghana.', 'Pharmacokinetics of the First-Line Antituberculosis Drugs in Ghanaian Children with Tuberculosis with or without HIV Coinfection.', 'Evaluation of the Adequacy of the 2010 Revised World Health Organization Recommended Dosages of the First-line Antituberculosis Drugs for Children: Adequacy of Revised Dosages of TB Drugs for Children.', 'Evaluation of the Adequacy of WHO Revised Dosages of the First-Line Antituberculosis Drugs in Children with Tuberculosis Using Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulations.', 'Global estimates and determinants of antituberculosis drug pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.', 'Optimizing treatment outcome of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs: the role of therapeutic drug monitoring.']"""

However, it is unclear whether the higher iron concentration in patients stems from an influx of iron into the tissue or a relative reduction in tissue compartments without much iron. By taking into account structural volume, we investigated tissue iron content in the deep gray matter (DGM) over 2 years, and compared findings to previously reported changes in iron concentration. 120 MS patients and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Clinical testing and MRI were performed both at baseline and after 2 years. Overall, iron content was calculated from structural MRI and quantitative susceptibility mapping in the thalamus, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. MS patients had significantly lower iron content than controls in the thalamus, with progressive MS patients demonstrating lower iron content than relapsing-remitting patients. Over 2 years, iron content decreased in the DGM of patients with MS, while it tended to increase or remain stable among controls. In the thalamus, decreasing iron content over 2 years was associated with disability progression. Our study showed that temporally increasing magnetic susceptibility in MS should not be considered as evidence for iron influx because it may be explained, at least partially, by disease-related atrophy. Declining DGM iron content suggests that, contrary to the current understanding, iron is being removed from the DGM in patients with MS.""","""['Ferdinand Schweser', 'Jesper Hagemeier', 'Michael G Dwyer', 'Niels Bergsland', 'Simon Hametner', 'Bianca Weinstock-Guttman', 'Robert Zivadinov']""","""[' Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center, Department of Neurology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA.', ' Center for Biomedical Imaging, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA.', ' IRCCS, Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Milan, Italy.', ' Department of Neuroimmunology, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ' Jacobs Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Hum Brain Mapp""","""['Automated segmentation of cerebral deep gray matter from MRI scans: effect of field strength on sensitivity and reliability.', 'Increased mean R2* in the deep gray matter of multiple sclerosis patients: Have we been measuring atrophy?', 'Changes of deep gray matter magnetic susceptibility over 2\xa0years in multiple sclerosis and healthy control brain.', 'Five year iron changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis deep gray matter compared to healthy controls.', 'Deep gray matter changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis detected by multi-parametric, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'Clinical correlates of R1 relaxometry and magnetic susceptibility changes in multiple sclerosis: a multi-parameter quantitative MRI study of brain iron and myelin.', 'Iron deposition in multiple sclerosis: overall load or distribution alteration?', 'Sex bias in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders: How it influences clinical course, MRI parameters and prognosis.', 'Cerebral Iron Deposition in Neurodegeneration.', 'Evaluating iron deposition in gray matter nuclei of patients with unilateral middle cerebral artery stenosis using quantitative susceptibility mapping.']"""

Patients and their referred relatives have been evaluated regarding clinical features and genetic counseling. The database of our collaborative team was used for the study.Results: Total 141 individuals have been evaluated. Among 84 subjects genetic counseling was given, diagnosis of HD was confirmed genetically in 34 (42.0%) of individuals (25 were symptomatic-HD, 9 were presymptomatic-HD). Fifty-seven patients were previously diagnosed with HD. The mean age of onset was 42.4 (11.9) years. Chorea was mostly reported initial symptom. The mean CAG repeat number of the expanded allele was 44.1 (5.1) and correlated inversely with the age of onset (p < 0.001). During a 4.8 (3.1) year follow-up, 10% of the patients were deceased. At the last visit, over half of patients had all of the movement, behavioral and cognitive problems, and 41.6% of them had required 24-hr supervision appropriate (UHDRS-independence score 64.6 (24.4)). Paternal inheritance was related to higher CAG repeats, younger age of disease onset, and higher UHDRS-motor scores.Conclusion: HD in Turkey is a severe disabling disease affecting a younger adult population.

Following this line of work, the current study uses machine learning approaches to predict aphasia severity and specific language measures based on a multimodal neuroimaging dataset. A total of 116 individuals with chronic left-hemisphere stroke were included in the study. Neuroimaging data included task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion-based fractional anisotropy (FA)-values, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and lesion-load data. The Western Aphasia Battery was used to measure aphasia severity and specific language functions. As a primary analysis, we constructed support vector regression (SVR) models predicting language measures based on (i) each neuroimaging modality separately, (ii) lesion volume alone, and (iii) a combination of all modalities. Prediction accuracy across models was subsequently statistically compared. Prediction accuracy across modalities and language measures varied substantially (predicted vs. empirical correlation range: r = .00-.67). The multimodal prediction model yielded the most accurate prediction in all cases (r = .53-.67). Statistical superiority in favor of the multimodal model was achieved in 28/30 model comparisons (p-value range: <.001-.046). Our results indicate that different neuroimaging modalities carry complementary information that can be integrated to more accurately depict how brain damage and remaining functionality of intact brain tissue translate into language function in aphasia.""","""['Sigfus Kristinsson', 'Wanfang Zhang', 'Chris Rorden', 'Roger Newman-Norlund', 'Alexandra Basilakos', 'Leonardo Bonilha', 'Grigori Yourganov', 'Feifei Xiao', 'Argye Hillis', 'Julius Fridriksson']""","""[' Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.', ' Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.', ' Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', ' Advanced Computing and Data Science, Cyberinfrastructure and Technology Integration, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA.', ' Department of Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', ' Department of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Hum Brain Mapp""","""['Multimodal Neural and Behavioral Data Predict Response to Rehabilitation in Chronic Poststroke Aphasia.', 'Enhanced estimations of post-stroke aphasia severity using stacked multimodal predictions.', 'The utility of lesion classification in predicting language and treatment outcomes in chronic stroke-induced aphasia.', 'Anatomical predictors of aphasia recovery: a tractography study of bilateral perisylvian language networks.', 'Neuroimaging in aphasia treatment research: quantifying brain lesions after stroke.', 'A Comparative Investigation of Automatic Speech Recognition Platforms for Aphasia Assessment Batteries.', 'Brain age predicts long-term recovery in post-stroke aphasia.', 'Mapping lesion, structural disconnection, and functional disconnection to symptoms in semantic aphasia.', 'Predictors of Therapy Response in Chronic Aphasia: Building a Foundation for Personalized Aphasia Therapy.', 'Multimodal Neural and Behavioral Data Predict Response to Rehabilitation in Chronic Poststroke Aphasia.']"""

Based on a validated 360-degree assessment simulating a first day of residency we developed a training for final-year medical students including patient consultation, patient management, and patient hand-off. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the training was changed to a telemedicine format and evaluated. Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly designed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items. The two formats were compared with t-tests. Results: The students were similarly satisfied with the content of the training independently of its format. Both groups found the patient cases interesting (presence: 4.68 ± 0.49, telemedicine: 4.66 ± 0.48). With respect to the telemedicine format, participants were glad that an option had been found that could be offered throughout the final year (4.94 ± 0.24) despite the COVID-19 pandemic and they regarded it as a very useful training for their final examination (4.94 ± 0.24). Conclusion: The telemedicine format of the competence-based training worked as well as the presence format.

A life course approach challenges us to consider if, and how, these inequities trace back to early life conditions, and chronic inflammation represents a potentially important mechanism through which early environments may have lasting effects on health in adulthood. Low birth weight (LBW) and shorter durations of breastfeeding both predict increased inflammation in adulthood, which is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and all-cause mortality. Using data from a large representative sample of young adults in the US (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)), we document the socioeconomic status (SES) gradient in chronic inflammation, as indicated by concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). Using a nested set of structural equation models and marginal standardization techniques, we investigate the extent to which this gradient is explained by patterns of LBW and breastfeeding in infancy. Findings reveal a particularly important role for breastfeeding duration: Based on model predictive margins, increasing breastfeeding duration to three or more months corresponds to a flattening of the SES gradient by 80%, and 83% when LBW is eliminated.

As MM is evolving toward a chronic disease, we sought to determine the prevalence of self-reported symptom burden and psychological distress, and to determine the association of distress with survival.  Methods:   The CPASS-7 patient-reported outcome instrument was administered to a convenience sample of MM patients at 7 outpatient cancer centers.  Results:   A total of 239 patients completed the CPASS-7 between September 2015 and October 2016%; 57% of respondents were male, and median age was 67 years. Forty-eight percent were concerned that they could not do the things they wanted to do, with 33% reporting decreased performance status. Financial toxicity concerns were self-reported by 44%, with family burdens noted in 24%. Although depression was reported by only 15%, 41% noted lack of pleasure. Pain was a concern in 36%. With a median follow-up of 316 days since CPASS-7 completion, 13% of patients had died. A high total distress score was noted in 57 (24%) and trended toward an association with a decreased survival rate compared to the 182 patients (76%) with a low total distress score (P = .066).

In reality, the aftermath is powerfully nuanced by the presence of risk factors and specific molecular mechanisms. Our objective was to raise awareness around the unpredictable association between COVID-19 pandemics and the upcoming flu season, and make arguments about the need to develop new routine testing protocols for both viruses, at least during the period with an expected high incidence. Our reasoning is built around the various impacts that the whole range of risk groups, common immunological mechanisms, and complex interactions, such as influenza vaccination, will have on patients' prognosis.

Many with overweight or obesity ascribe negative ideas to themselves, resulting in internalized weight bias (IWB). In adults, IWB has been associated with psychosocial problems; however, this relationship has been studied little in children. This study aims to describe IWB in children with overweight and obesity and to study the association of children's IWB with experienced weight bias, self-esteem, and their parents' IWB. Methods: Children ages 9-18 with overweight or obesity completed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Perception of Teasing Scale; parents completed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale-Modified and the Perceived Weight Discrimination Scale. Descriptive statistics were used to assess IWB, self-esteem, and experienced weight stigma. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine associations between categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify correlates of IWB in children. Results: Of 111 child participants, the median WBIS score was 2.8 out of 7. Higher IWB was associated with more peer teasing (p < 0.001) and lower self-esteem (p < 0.001). IWB in children was not associated with child BMI z-score (p = 0.590) or higher parent IWB (p = 0.287). Conclusions: Children with overweight and obesity who have experienced more teasing by peers or who have lower self-esteem are more likely to have a higher IWB.

Methods:   Study centers in China were identified using data from five double-blind, randomized, phase III studies of adjunctive perampanel (2-12 mg/day) and their open-label extensions (OLEx). Efficacy assessments included median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days, and 50% and 75% responder and seizure-freedom rates. Safety/tolerability assessments included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  Results:   Overall, 277 patients (placebo, n = 79; perampanel, n = 198) were included in the double-blind safety analysis set. The full analysis set comprised 274 patients (FS, n = 238 [placebo, n = 60; perampanel, n = 178]; FBTCS, n = 120 [placebo, n = 31; perampanel, n = 89]; GTCS, n = 36 [placebo, n = 18; perampanel, n = 18]). Median percent reductions in seizure frequency for placebo vs perampanel were as follows: 16.6% vs 32.4% (FS; P < 0.05) and 39.1% vs 48.2% (FBTCS; not significant [NS]) at 4-12 mg/day, and 37.9% vs 82.6% (GTCS; NS) at 8 mg/day; 50% responder rates were 31.7% vs 37.4% (FS; NS), 48.4% vs 51.9% (FBTCS; NS), and 33.3% vs 61.1% (GTCS; NS), respectively. Seizure-freedom rates were 1.7% vs 9.2%, 16.1% vs 25.3%, and 16.7% vs 44.4%, respectively (all NS). Overall, 262 patients entered the OLEx (FS, n = 228; GTCS, n = 34). Perampanel was efficacious for up to four years for FS and FBTCS and up to two years for GTCS. Across the double-blind and OLEx studies, TEAEs were reported in 65.7% and 81.3% of perampanel-treated patients, respectively; the most common was dizziness. Efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes were generally similar between Chinese and non-Chinese patients.

This study sought to investigate predictors of comorbid patterns of anaemia and diarrhoea using the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS).  Methods:   The study employed analysis of secondary data from the 2014 GDHS. We performed a multivariate complex sample logistic regression and spatial analysis.  Results:   The weighted prevalence of comorbid anaemia and diarrhoea was 9.28% with the highest burden (16.45%) found in the Upper West region. Independent predictors (risk factors) of comorbid patterns of anaemia and diarrhoea were children aged 6-23 mo (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.33), male gender (OR=1.50, 95% C1 1.04 to 2.16), history of fever (OR=4.37, 95% CI 2.94 to 6.50) and living in a household with two children aged <5 y (OR=1.80, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.84). Protective factors were having a father with secondary or higher education (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.97), living in a household with ≥6 members (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75) and living in a richer household (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.89). Surface maps revealed inter-regional and subregional variations.  Conclusion:   The study shows that the independent predictors of comorbid patterns of anaemia and diarrhoea among children aged <5 y in Ghana are age, gender, history of fever, the number of children aged <5 y in the household, parental education, household size and household wealth.

We collected data from a sample of 323 new mothers in Washington, D.C., who described their infant sleep practices and perceived personal social networks. We find evidence that mothers' social networks play a significant role in the likelihood that they adjust their infant sleep practices within the first few months of their infants' lives. Mothers are more likely to change sleep practices when health professionals and/or (lay) family members advise them to do so. The influence of network members is not always positive. For mothers who initially follow safe practices, their probability of change increases if their network members substantially espouse unsafe practices. Among mothers with initially unsafe practices, network members' level of support for safe sleep practices is not predictive of the likelihood of sleep practice change.

In this study, we determined nearly complete genome sequences of four BastVs in the feces of healthy pigs. Genetic characterization revealed that these porcine BastVs (PBastVs) and BastVs from other animals including humans, had the same genome organization, that is, they contained three predicted conserved domains of viral methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and RdRp in the nonstructural ORF1 and the astrovirus capsid domain in the structural ORF2. Phylogenetic analyses using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the capsid region revealed that PBastVs branched with bat and rat BastVs; however, the groups formed by each host were distantly related to human BastVs. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparison demonstrated that PBastVs shared 95.2-98.6% and 76.1-95.5% sequence identity among each other in the ORF1 and ORF2 regions, respectively; the sequence identities between PBastVs and BastVs from other animals were 21.4-42.5% and 9.1-20.6% in the ORF1 and ORF2 regions, respectively.

As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is a significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.""","""['Andrew Wen', 'Liwei Wang', 'Huan He', 'Sijia Liu', 'Sunyang Fu', 'Sunghwan Sohn', 'Jacob A Kugel', 'Vinod C Kaggal', 'Ming Huang', 'Yanshan Wang', 'Feichen Shen', 'Jungwei Fan', 'Hongfang Liu']""","""[' Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ' Advanced Analytics Service Unit, Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ' Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

In this study, we examined if individuals admitted for suicide-related concerns were more likely than those admitted for other reasons to have elevated PTSD symptoms or a probable PTSD diagnosis. We also examined the moderating role of impulsivity. Participants were 188 trauma-exposed adult psychiatric inpatients (M [SD]age = 33.6 y [11.7 y], 63.3% male, 46.3% white). We used the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 to assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, suicidal ideation severity, and impulsivity, respectively. We controlled for trauma load, number of psychiatric diagnoses, and comorbid depressive and substance use disorders. Patients admitted for suicide-related concerns (55.3%; n = 104), compared with those admitted for other reasons (44.7%; n = 84), had more severe PTSD symptoms, corresponding to medium-to-large effect sizes; associations were stronger at higher levels of impulsivity. Additionally, patients admitted for suicide-related concerns were nearly four times more likely than their counterparts to screen positive for a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Among the subset of individuals admitted for suicide-related concerns, greater PTSD symptoms were associated with more severe suicidal ideation. In sum, PTSD symptoms are elevated among psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide-related concerns, and among this subgroup, greater PTSD symptom severity covaries with suicidal ideation severity.

Methods:   We describe 11 patients who had both recurrent acute and/or chronic pancreatitis and type 1 diabetes (T1D) requiring insulin therapy.  Results:   All 11 patients had positive autoantibodies and 8 patients tested had minimal to undetectable (7/8) or moderate (1/8) stimulated C-peptide at 12 months after T1D onset. Three had biopsy confirmation of insulitis.  Conclusions:   These cases lend support to the theory that pancreatitis may increase risk for T1D.

Antiepileptic drugs reported to interact with ≥1 form of hormonal contraception were reviewed. Scaled concordance was quantified using linearly weighted percent agreement (wPA). Differences in interaction severity rankings between hormonal contraception forms were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. There was high agreement among compendia for interactions of combined hormonal contraception interactions with AEDs (wPA = 0.82-0.84), especially potent enzyme-inducing AEDs (wPA = 0.89). However, concordance was reduced for AED interactions with progestin-only contraception (wPA = 0.69-0.81). Extreme interaction reporting discrepancies were found for less potent enzyme-inducing AEDs. The greatest variability in interaction reporting was observed for injectable and intrauterine contraception (wPA = 0.69 and 0.70, respectively), which are the only hormonal contraception options currently classified as not interacting with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Drug-drug interaction reporting variability can have major clinical implications and highlights critical knowledge gaps in the care of women with epilepsy of childbearing age.

The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April-July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies - primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic - weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states. We provide insight about how specific existing and emergency-related policies can reduce adverse mental health consequences of household income shocks.""","""['Rachel Donnelly', 'Mateo P Farina']""","""[' Department of Sociology, Vanderbilt University, United States.

Methods: A total of 2,968 lifetime cocaine users were identified from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III. Mediation analysis was utilized to examine cocaine use quantity, frequency, and duration as potential mediators in the association between CM PSU and CocUD. A parallel multiple mediator model and a structural equation model were used, respectively, to examine: (1) the individual contribution of cocaine use quantity, frequency, and duration, and (2) combined contribution as a set specified by a latent variable. Results: Cocaine users were divided into 2,782 (93.7%) CM polysubstance users and 186 (6.3%) cocaine only users. CM PSU was associated with decreased risk of CocUD, but after including the mediators, the association was no longer significant. Examined separately, only quantity was found to be a significant mediator over and above frequency and duration, while the latent variable with three cocaine use pattern indicators explained 56.6% of the total association between CM PSU and CocUD. Conclusions: Compared to cocaine only users, CM polysubstance users were less likely to use cocaine heavily; this lower intensity of cocaine use was in turn associated with decreased risk of CocUD.

Methods:   We collected data as part of a randomized clinical trial that examined whether SBIRT delivered electronically (e-SBIRT) or by a clinician (SBIRT) is superior to enhanced usual care (EUC) for substance misuse. Participants were a convenience sample of 439 women from two reproductive health care centers who used cigarettes, risky amounts of alcohol, illicit drugs, or misused prescription medication. For each participant, we measured economic outcomes by self-report 6 months pre- and post-intervention.

Results:   None of the difference-in-differences estimates weas statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.  Conclusion:   In a population of women receiving routine care in reproductive health care settings, we did not find a significant effect of either e-SBIRT or SBIRT, compared to EUC, on general health care utilization, criminal activity, or motor vehicle outcomes.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the comorbid depression in schizophrenia are still unknown. The main purpose of this study was to characterize the structural abnormalities of first-episodes drug-naïve (FEDN) schizophrenia comorbid with depression by utilizing both volume-based and surface-based morphometric measurements. Forty-two patients with FEDN schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls were recruited. The 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) was administrated to divide all patients into depressive patients (DP) and non-depressive patients (NDP). Compared with NDP, DP had a significantly larger volume and surface area in the left isthmus cingulate cortex and also had a greater volume in the left posterior cingulate cortex. Correlation analysis showed that HAMD total score was positively correlated with the surface area of the left isthmus cingulate and gray matter volume of the left isthmus cingulate cortex. In addition, gray matter volume of the left isthmus cingulate was also correlated with the PANSS general psychopathology or total score. The findings suggest that prominent structural abnormalities of gray matter are mainly concentrated on the cingulate cortex in FEDN schizophrenia patients comorbid with depression, which may contribute to depressive symptoms and psychopathological symptoms.""","""['Gao-Xia Wei', 'Likun Ge', 'Li-Zhen Chen', 'Bo Cao', 'Xiangyang Zhang']""","""[' CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China.', ' CAS Key Laboratory of Behavioral Science, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China.', ' Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ' Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Hum Brain Mapp""","""['The contribution of the cingulate cortex: treating depressive symptoms in first-episode drug naïve schizophrenia.', 'Prevalence, demographic and clinical features of comorbid depressive symptoms in drug naïve patients with schizophrenia presenting with first episode psychosis.', 'Association of cerebral deficits with clinical symptoms in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia: an optimized voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional connectivity study.', 'Dimensions of depressive symptoms and cingulate volumes in older adults.', 'A cross-sectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study of cingulate gyrus gray matter volume abnormalities in first-episode schizophrenia and first-episode affective psychosis.', 'The contribution of the cingulate cortex: treating depressive symptoms in first-episode drug naïve schizophrenia.', 'A comparison of uni- and multi-variate methods for identifying brain networks activated by cognitive tasks using intracranial EEG.']"""

Methods:   The study was conducted among 14 653 women aged 15-49 y using data from the 2016-2018 Papua New Guinea Demographic and Health Survey. The outcome variable was barriers to accessing healthcare. Descriptive and multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted. Statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05.  Results:   Women aged 15-19 y were more likely to experience at least one barrier compared with those aged 40-49 y (adjusted OR [AOR]=1.48; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.86). Women with secondary/higher education (AOR=0.68; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.81), women in the richest wealth quintile (AOR=0.36; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46) and those in the least disadvantaged socioeconomic status (AOR=0.46; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.64) had lower odds of having challenges with at least one barrier to healthcare.

Methods:   Tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-naive patients with inflammatory back pain with at least 2 SpA features and high disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index score ≥4), without the requirement of a positive finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac (SI) joint and/or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, were randomized (1:1) to receive ETN (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 16 weeks and subsequently were followed up for a further 8 weeks (to 24 weeks from baseline) without study medication. The primary end point was the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 20 (ASAS20) response at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and changes in disease parameters, including the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), CRP level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada index scores (MRI of the SI joint), after 16 and 24 weeks.  Results:   Patient characteristics at baseline were comparable between the ETN and placebo groups. At 16 weeks, there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients exhibiting ASAS20 response between the ETN group (6 patients [16.7%]) and the placebo group (4 patients [11.1%]) (relative risk 0.7 [95% confidence interval 0.2-2.2], P = 0.5). Only the ESR showed more improvement in the ETN group compared to the placebo group at 16 weeks (decreases of 2.2 mm/hour and 1.4 mm/hour, respectively), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Between 16 and 24 weeks, without study medication, the BASMI, CRP level, and ESR had worsened to a greater extent in the ETN group compared to the placebo group, with the difference being significant for the CRP level.

We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health. There were also notable differences in psychological outcome; Hong Kong, with very strict social distancing protocols plus ongoing political unrest, suffered the most drastic deterioration of mental health.

Our objective was to determine the prevalence and patterns of co-occurring substance use disorders identified at delivery hospitalizations among US women.  Methods:   Using data from the National Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative sample of hospitalizations in the US, we identified females ages 15 to 44 years with a delivery hospitalization from 2007 to 2016 (weighted N = 38 million). We identified diagnoses for use of any of the following substance use disorders: alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, opioids, sedatives, or tobacco. Using multivariable regression, we calculated the weighted adjusted prevalence of additional substances used within each specific substance use disorder category.  Results:   Seven percent of women were diagnosed with any substance use disorder at delivery hospitalization (6.5% tobacco, 1% cannabis, 0.5% opioids, and <1% amphetamines, alcohol, cocaine, and sedatives). Among those with any substance use disorder diagnosis, the adjusted prevalence of any co-occurring use disorder was greatest for those who used alcohol (69%), cocaine (69%), amphetamines (63%), and opioids (62%). Among pregnant women who were diagnosed with cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol or opioid use disorder, tobacco (>45% in all groups), and cannabis (>10% in all groups) were the most common additional substances used. Tobacco and cannabis use disorders were commonly diagnosed together.  Conclusions:   Co-occurring substance use disorders are common among women with any substance use disorder in pregnancy.

Methods:   We conducted a qualitative descriptive study of interviews between HH nurses and the study investigator. Thirty-two interviews with HH nurses were transcribed and analyzed. Nurses were mostly female, college-educated, and had several years of experience in HH nursing.  Results:   We identified findings in four major themes: 1) HH nurses' definition and identification of UI, 2) the absence of formal guidelines for diagnosing UI in HH patients, 3) UI's adverse effect on HH patients and their families, and 4) the lack of standardized guidelines for the management of UI in the HH setting. We found that there was a general lack of clarity on the subtypes of UI and no standardized guidelines for management of UI in the HH setting. Nurses reported that UI was bothersome to HH patients and their caregivers, citing patient discomfort, loss of dignity, and additional labor burden as reasons for this. Management strategies for UI lacked standardization.  Conclusion:   UI is a prevalent and debilitating condition in HH patients.

Urine was collected from participants on the day of oocyte retrieval. Samples were analyzed for a series of phthalates, MEP, MBP, MPP, MHxP, MEHP, MEHHP, MECPP, MiNP, MiDP, MCHP, and MBzP, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We employed Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to estimate associations between urinary phthalate levels and biochemical pregnancy and live birth, adjusted for partner's concentration and confounding factors. Doublings in women's MBP (relative risk (RR) = 0.32, 95 % CI: 0.13, 0.78), and men's MEHP (RR = 0.28, 95 % CI: 0.09, 0.83), were associated with a lower likelihood for pregnancy.

Methods:   Using the National Provider Identifier data, we identified two types of oncology workforce via the healthcare provider taxonomy codes. Oncologists were physicians self-identified as providing oncologic care to patients. Oncology pharmacists were pharmacists with an oncology subspecialty. We calculated the geographic density of physician and pharmacist oncology workforce and used county-level cancer crude rates to quantify the demand for oncology workforce. We used spatial data to plot the density of oncology workforces relative to county-level cancer rates and compared the county-level density of oncologists and oncology pharmacists.  Results:   Of the 30,553 members of the oncology workforce in 2019, 28,681 were oncologists and 1,090 were oncology pharmacists. The mean county-level density of oncologists was 2.94 (SD = 7.32) per 100,000 persons. Sixty-four percent of counties had no oncologists with primary practice location in that county and 12% had no oncologists in the local and adjacent counties. Counties in the top quartile of cancer rates had the highest percentage without any oncologists with primary practice location in the county (75%) and with no oncologists in the local as well as adjacent counties (16%).

Yet, dynamic measures for inertia and instability of negative and positive affect have not been studied in terms of their association with cigarette dependence. This study builds an important bridge between the psychology and substance use literatures by introducing these novel measures and conducting a comprehensive examination of such association with intervention implications.  Methods:   This study conducted secondary analysis on the data from a community sample of 136 dual users (e-cigarette + cigarette) and 101 exclusive smokers who completed both the two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and cigarette dependence assessments in a recent study.  Results:   Among dual users, a higher average level of negative affect, lower inertia of negative affect (i.e., less sustained negative affect), and higher instability of positive affect (i.e., greater magnitude of changes in positive affect) were associated with higher cigarette dependence. The patterns of associations among exclusive smokers were, however, different. Higher inertia of negative affect, lower instability of positive affect, and higher variability of negative affect were associated with higher dependence.  Conclusions:   The results illustrate the importance of examining not only negative affect but also positive affect in order to fully understand the association between emotion dynamics and cigarette dependence. The different patterns of association between emotion dynamics and cigarette dependence across the two groups of cigarette users also call for future research that is designed to compare cigarettes and e-cigarettes in terms of their effects on emotion regulation.""","""['Anne Buu', 'Zhanrui Cai', 'Runze Li', 'Su-Wei Wong', 'Hsien-Chang Lin', 'Wei-Chung Su', 'Douglas E Jorenby', 'Megan E Piper']""","""[' Department of Health Promotion and Behavioral Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center, 7000 Fannin St., Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

Personality disorders are a significant correlate of IPA, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Much of that work, however, had been conducted in younger samples. IPA in older adults is a relatively understudied area of research generally. Thus, examining the association between personality pathology and IPA in older adults is novel and important. In previous work using the St. Louis Personality and Aging Network sample, we found that borderline personality disorder was a robust correlate of perpetrating partner aggression in older, romantically involved participants. In the current analyses, we attempted to replicate our original findings in the same sample assessed 2.5 years later. We also extended the original work by using both self- and partner-reported IPA and by using latent factors of personality pathology. We found that prevalence of IPA in this sample was similar to the baseline assessment; 69.1% reported IPA in the past year, with the vast majority being psychological/verbal rather than physical aggression. Agreement between partners on perpetration was modest. Borderline personality pathology was again the strongest and most consistent predictor of IPA. Our findings speak to the continuing public health burden of borderline personality pathology into older age as evidenced by associations with perpetration of IPA.

Transgender people report more drug use than cisgender people; however, it is unclear whether they have higher likelihood of drug use disorders. We examined whether transgender patients have increased likelihood of documented drug use disorders relative to cisgender patients in the national Veterans Health Administration (VA).  Methods:   Electronic health record data were extracted for VA outpatients from 10/1/09 to 7/31/17. Transgender status and past-year documentation of drug use disorders (any, opioid, amphetamine, cocaine, cannabis, sedative, hallucinogen) were measured using diagnostic codes. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios for drug use disorders among transgender compared to cisgender patients, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity and year. Effect modification by presence of ≥1 mental health condition was tested using multiplicative interaction.  Results:   Among 8,872,793 patients, 8619 (0.1%) were transgender. Transgender patients were more likely than cisgender patients to have any drug use disorder (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-1.83), amphetamine (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.82-2.70), cocaine (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.29-1.95), and cannabis (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.62-2.05) use disorders. There was no significant interaction by presence of ≥1 mental health condition.

The current study investigated the time to conception as well as the gestational and the neurodevelopmental outcomes of offspring of men with epilepsy on ASM compared to controls. Additionally, the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, and measures of sexual performance in males with and without epilepsy were analyzed.  Methods:   A total of 450 male patients with and without epilepsy at one hospital were provided questionnaires to determine demographic characteristics, epilepsy history, type of ASM at the time of conception, comorbidities and sexual health. Time to conception, fertility methods and offspring birth and developmental history born to males with and without epilepsy was recorded. Survey data was evaluated using Student's t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Odds ratio (OR) were calculated to determine associations between the measured data.  Results:   After matching for age, we analyzed a total of 110 males with epilepsy and 110 without epilepsy. In the epilepsy group there was a higher rate of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation when compared to the control group (N = 110; OR 3.39; 95% IC: 1.87-6.13, p < 0.001). Males with epilepsy also had a higher frequency of low erection scores when compared to males without epilepsy (N = 70 with epilepsy, N = 76 without epilepsy; OR 3.67; 95% IC: 1.44-9.39, p = 0.005). Of the 110 men with a diagnosis of epilepsy, 17 conceived children while using ASMs (38 total children). A total of 18.42% of children born to fathers on ASMs experienced developmental delays compared to 2.63% of controls, however this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.056). In addition, we did not find that offspring had significantly different birth weights or gestational ages in men on ASM compared to controls (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   The present study suggests that men with epilepsy have an increased incidence of psychiatric comorbidities, and altered sexual performance, specifically erectile dysfunction, when compared with men without epilepsy.

Better targeting of public health interventions is needed to achieve rubella elimination goals. To that end, we measured the epidemiological characteristics and seasonal dynamic patterns of rubella and determined its association with meteorological factors in Shaanxi Province, China. Data on rubella cases in Shaanxi Province from 2005 to 2018 were obtained from the Chinese National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. The Morlet wavelet analysis was used to estimate temporal periodicity of rubella incidence. Mixed generalized additive models were used to measure associations between meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) and rubella incidence. A total of 17,185 rubella cases were reported in Shaanxi during the study period, for an annual incidence of 3.27 cases per 100,000 population. Interannual oscillations in rubella incidence of 0.8-1.4 years, 3.8-4.8 years, and 0.5 years were detected. Both temperature and relative humidity exhibited nonlinear associations with the incidence of rubella. The accumulative relative risk of transmission for the overall pooled estimates was maximized at a temperature of 0.23°C and relative humidity of 41.6%. This study found that seasonality and meteorological factors have impact on the transmission of rubella; public health interventions to eliminate rubella must consider periodic and seasonal fluctuations as well as meteorological factors.""","""['Yu Ma', 'Kun Liu', 'Weijun Hu', 'Shuxuan Song', 'Shaobai Zhang', 'Zhongjun Shao']""","""["" 1Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Hazard Assessment and Control in Special Operational Environment, School of Public Health, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", "" 2Shaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Am J Trop Med Hyg""","""['Impact of meteorological factors on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in 19 cities in China, 2005-2014.', 'Effects and interaction of meteorological factors on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence in Huludao City, northeastern China, 2007-2018.', 'Correlation Analysis of Rubella Incidence and Meteorological Variables Based on Chinese Medicine Theory of Yunqi.', 'Spatiotemporal characteristics and meteorological determinants of hand, foot and mouth disease in Shaanxi Province, China: a county-level analysis.', ""Population-based study and a scoping review for the epidemiology and seasonality in and effect of weather on Bell's palsy.""]"""

Methods:   We tested the effect of residency status (rural areas [RA < 2500 inhabitants] vs. urban clusters [UC ≥ 2500 inhabitants] vs. urbanized areas [UA, ≥50,000 inhabitants]) on BCa stage at presentation, as well as on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other cause mortality (OCM), according to the US Census Bureau definition. Multivariate competing risks regression (CRR) models were fitted after matching of RA or UC with UA in stage-stratified analyses.  Results:   Of 222,330 patients, 3496 (1.6%) resided in RA, 25,462 (11.5%) in UC and 193,372 (87%) in UA. Age, tumor stage, radical cystectomy rates or chemotherapy use were comparable between RA, UC and UA (all p > 0.05). At 10 years, RA was associated with highest OCM followed by UC and UA (30.9% vs. 27.7% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.01). Similarly, CSM was also marginally higher in RA or UC vs. UA (20.0% vs. 20.1% vs. 18.8%, p = 0.01). In stage-stratified, fully matched CRR analyses, increased OCM and CSM only applied to stage T1 BCa patients.  Conclusion:   We did not observe meaningful differences in access to treatment or stage distribution, according to residency status. However, RA and to a lesser extent UC residency status, were associated with higher OCM and marginally higher CSM in T1N0M0 patients. This observation should be further validated or refuted in additional epidemiological investigations.""","""['Marina Deuker', 'L Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Claudia Collà Ruvolo', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Zhe Tian', 'Frederik C Roos', 'Andreas Becker', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Derya Tilki', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[' Department of Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

However, it is unclear how molecular pathways regulate the infiltration of immune cells, as well as how interactions between tumor-infiltrating immune cells and T cell activation affect breast cancer patient survival. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the relative abundance of 22 immune cell types. The association between mRNAs and immune cell abundance were assessed by Spearman correlation analysis. Enriched pathways were identified using MetaCore pathway analysis. The interactions between the T cell activation status and the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox regression models in a publicly available dataset of 1081 breast cancer patients. The role of tumor-infiltrating B cells in antitumor immunity, immune response of T cell subsets, and breakdown of CD4+ T cell peripheral tolerance were positively associated with M1 macrophage and CD8+ T cell but negatively associated with M2 macrophage. Abundant plasma cell was associated with prolonged survival (HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67), and abundant M2 macrophage was associated with shortened survival (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.23-2.60). There exists a significant interaction between the T cell activation status and the resting DC abundance level (p = 0.025).

Aim:   To describe outcomes of obesity treatment for children with developmental disabilities and a comparison group of children without developmental disabilities.  Methods and procedures:   We examined weight outcomes of children with and without developmental disabilities seen in a family-centered, multidisciplinary treatment center over a ten-year period. We stratified by age and developmental disability diagnosis. We assessed whether intake demographic or health behavior data was associated with successful reduction of adiposity over six and twelve month follow-up periods, using a ≥5% absolute reduction in percent over the 95th percentile body mass index (BMIp95) as the primary outcome.  Outcomes and results:   Over a ten-year period, 148 of 556 children in the obesity clinic (27 %) had a developmental disability. In children <12 years of age, 36 % of children with developmental disabilities reduced their adiposity compared with 18 % of children without developmental disabilities at six months, p = .01. This pattern continued at twelve months. Active transport to school was associated with reduced adiposity for those without a disability. Older children with disabilities rarely had a significant reduction (2 of 26 children), and they took more medications with weight-related side effects.  Conclusions and implications:   Younger children with developmental disabilities experienced relative success in reducing their adiposity.

The newly created COVID-19 programs include 7 weekly sessions (Community Health Worker [in English and Spanish], Critical Care, Education, First-Responder Resiliency, Infectious Disease Office Hours, and Multi-specialty) and 3 one-day special sessions. We calculated the total number of attendees, along with the range and standard deviation, per session by program. Certain programs (Critical Care, Infectious Disease Office Hours, Multi-specialty) recorded the profession of attendees when available. The Project ECHO research team collected COVID-19 infection data by county from March 11 through May 31, 2020. During that same period, 9765 health care and general education professionals participated in the COVID-19 programs, and participants from 31 of 35 (89%) counties in New Mexico attended the sessions. Our initial evaluation of these programs demonstrates that an interprofessional clinician group and teachers used the Project ECHO network to build a community of practice and social network while meeting their educational and professional needs.

There are limited data on the impact of increased recipient age on post-simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) transplant outcomes among patients with CKD, leading some centers to employ subjective age cutoffs for potential SLK recipients.  Methods:   We evaluated United Network for Organ Sharing data of adult SLK recipients from February 27, 2002, to December 31, 2018, restricted to recipients with ≥90 days of waiting time and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate persistently <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥90 d using the modification of diet in renal disease-4 equation). We fit mixed-effects Cox regression models (center as random effect) to evaluate the association of recipient age and patient survival.  Results:   Among 3146 SLK recipients with CKD, nearly two-thirds were 50-64 years of age, while 465 (14.8%) and 93 (3.0%) were 65-69 years and ≥70 years, respectively. Compared with nondiabetic SLK recipients aged 50-59 years, SLK recipients ≥70 years of age without diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23; P = 0.007) and with diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.16-3.09; P = 0.01) had higher mortality compared with the reference group. In absolute terms, SLK recipients ≥70 years of age had 25% lower patient survival at 5 years compared to recipients aged 40-49 years.

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) analyzed statewide surveillance data to identify missed opportunities for prevention and collaborated with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) to inform response activities.  Methods:   ADHS developed a metric to identify missed opportunities for CS prevention during pregnancy by using medical records, vital records, and case investigation notes for all mothers of infants born with CS from January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. AHCCCS conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to calculate the effect of increasing perinatal syphilis screening.  Results:   Arizona had 57 cases of CS during the study period, of which 17 (29.8%) could have been prevented through third-trimester screening for women who were in prenatal care but screened late (n = 9), were infected after their first prenatal visit screen (n = 7), or were reinfected after an initial reactive syphilis test and appropriate treatment and not rescreened (n = 1). The estimated net cost of combining the additional primary (screening) and secondary (treatment) costs of a third-trimester screen for all pregnant AHCCCS members and the estimated total per-year savings of all newborn hospitalizations was $527.  Practice implications:   Third-trimester syphilis screening could prevent CS in regions where syphilis transmission is high. Partnering with health insurance agencies to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening recommendations may improve the accuracy of the estimate of the potential cost savings by using insurance agency-specific data for the population at risk for CS.""","""['Kaitlyn J Sykes', 'Rebecca A Scranton', 'Lisa Villarroel', 'Bree V Anderson', 'Sara Salek', 'Jonathan Stall']""","""[' 6577 Arizona Department of Health Services, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', ' 48679 Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, Phoenix, AZ, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Public Health Rep""","""['Third-Trimester Prenatal Syphilis Screening: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.', 'Characteristics Associated With Delivery of an Infant With Congenital Syphilis and Missed Opportunities for Prevention-California, 2012 to 2014.', 'Epidemic of congenital syphilis--Baltimore, 1996-1997.', 'Strategies of testing for syphilis during pregnancy.', 'Congenital syphilis in the twenty-first century: an area-based study.', 'Syphilis response policies and their assessments: A scoping review.']"""

Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity.

Methods:   In an 11-month case series, we investigated the use of cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic next-generation sequencing to diagnose viral infections among pediatric hospitalized patients presenting with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology. Cerebrospinal fluid from patients with known enterovirus meningitis were included as positive controls. Cerebrospinal fluid from patients with primary intracranial hypertension were included to serve as controls without known infections.  Results:   Cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic next-generation sequencing was performed for 37 patients. Among 27 patients with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, 4 were later diagnosed with viral encephalitis, 6 had non-central nervous system infections with central nervous system manifestations, 6 had no positive diagnostic tests, and 11 were found to have a noninfectious diagnosis. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified West Nile virus (WNV) in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 immunocompromised patient. Among the 4 patients with known enterovirus meningitis, metagenomic next-generation sequencing correctly identified enteroviruses and characterized the viral genotype. No viral sequences were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with primary intracranial hypertension. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing also identified sequences of nonpathogenic torque Teno virus in cerebrospinal fluid specimens from 13 patients.  Conclusions:   Our results showed viral detection by cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic next-generation sequencing only in 1 immunocompromised patient and did not offer a diagnostic advantage over conventional testing. Viral phylogenetic characterization by metagenomic next-generation sequencing could be used in epidemiologic investigations of some viral pathogens, such as enteroviruses. The finding of torque Teno viruses in cerebrospinal fluid by metagenomic next-generation sequencing is of unknown significance but may merit further exploration for a possible association with noninfectious central nervous system disorders.""","""['Guliz Erdem', 'Irina Kaptsan', 'Himanshu Sharma', 'Arvind Kumar', 'Shawn C Aylward', 'Amit Kapoor', 'Masako Shimamura']""","""["" Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, 2650Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", "" Center for Vaccines and Immunity, the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", "" Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, 2650Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""J Child Neurol""","""['Enhanced Virus Detection and Metagenomic Sequencing in Patients with Meningitis and Encephalitis.', 'Diagnosis of Streptococcus suis Meningoencephalitis with metagenomic next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid: a case report with literature review.', 'Clinical Metagenomic Sequencing for Diagnosis of Meningitis and Encephalitis.', 'Acute West Nile Virus Meningoencephalitis Diagnosed Via Metagenomic Deep Sequencing of Cerebrospinal Fluid in a Renal Transplant Patient.', 'Next-generation Sequencing of Cerebrospinal Fluid for the Diagnosis of Unexplained Central Nervous System Infections.', 'Evaluation of extraction and enrichment methods for recovery of respiratory RNA viruses in a metagenomics approach.', 'Metagenomics next-generation sequencing for the diagnosis of central nervous system infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals the Profile of Viral Infections in Kidney Transplant Recipients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Direct Metagenomic Diagnosis of Community-Acquired Meningitis: State of the Art.', 'Etiology, Clinical Phenotypes, Epidemiological Correlates, Laboratory Biomarkers and Diagnostic Challenges of Pediatric Viral Meningitis: Descriptive Review.']"""

Cost-related assessments are important to best allocate prevention funds.  Objectives:   To determine the (1) overall cost for implementing the Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) model, (2) cost of implementation per child, and (3) cost per case of maltreatment averted.  Design:   Cost-effective analysis of a randomized controlled trial.  Participants and setting:   102 pediatric providers at 18 pediatric primary care practices. 924 families with children < 6 years receiving care by those providers.  Methods:   Practices and their providers were randomized to either SEEK training and implementation or usual care. Families in SEEK and control practices were recruited for evaluation. Rates of psychological and physical abuse were calculated by parent self-report 12 months following recruitment. Model costs were calculated including salaries for team members, provider time for training and booster sessions, and development and distribution of materials.  Results:   Implementing SEEK in all 18 practices would have cost approximately $265,892 over 2.5 years; $3.59 per child per year; or $305.58 ($229.18-$381.97) to prevent one incident. Based on a very conservative cost estimate of $2779 per maltreatment incident, SEEK would save an estimated $2,151,878 in health care costs for 29,610 children.  Conclusions:   The SEEK model is cost saving. Cost per case of psychological and physical abuse averted were significantly lower than the short-term costs of medical and mental health care for maltreated children. SEEK model expansion has the potential to significantly decrease medical, mental health, and other related costs associated with maltreatment.""","""['Wendy G Lane', 'Howard Dubowitz', 'Kevin D Frick', 'Josh Semiatin', 'Laurence Magder']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 660 W.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between prediagnostic radiation exposure and survival after cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Participants in the Life Span Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive stomach, colon, or rectal cancer between 1958 and 2009 were followed for mortality during 1958-2014. Cox regression models were used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of radiation dose from atomic bomb exposure with survival (cancer-specific and overall) after cancer diagnosis. Analyses were adjusted for city of primary exposure, sex, age at diagnosis, and year of diagnosis.  Results:   We identified 7,728 eligible patients with cancer for analysis. We observed no statistically significant associations between radiation dose and cancer-specific survival among LSS participants with a gastrointestinal cancer. Higher radiation doses (≥1 Gy) were suggestively, but not significantly, associated with modestly poorer cancer-specific survival for colon cancer only (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90-2.12), and were associated with poorer overall survival regardless of cancer site.  Conclusions:   Although radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer incidence and mortality, study results are inconclusive about an association between prediagnostic radiation exposure and survival after gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis.  Impact:   Radiation exposure from the atomic bomb before gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis was not associated with cancer survival, but should be evaluated in relation to survival for other cancer types.""","""['Brandie Bockwoldt', 'Hiromi Sugiyama', 'Kevin Tsai', 'Parveen Bhatti', 'Alina V Brenner', 'Audrey Hu', 'Kathleen F Kerr', 'Eric Morenz', 'Benjamin French', 'Amanda I Phipps']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ' Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.', ' Cancer Control Research, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', ' Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ' Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. aiphipps@uw.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Effect of radiation exposure on survival after first solid cancer diagnosis in A-bomb survivors.', 'Solid Cancer Incidence among the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009.', 'Radiation-Related Risk of Cancers of the Upper Digestive Tract among Japanese Atomic Bomb Survivors.', 'Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012.', 'Cancer incidence in atomic bomb survivors.

We sought to explore the strength of correlation between reductions in self-reported alcohol use and change in PEth among a sample of women living with HIV (WLWH) who participated in a clinical trial to reduce heavy alcohol use. We also sought to determine whether this correlation was stronger in women with lower body mass index (BMI) and women without an alcohol use disorder (AUD).  Methods:   81 WLWH (mean age = 48.7, 80% Black) engaging in a randomized trial of naltrexone versus placebo with a positive baseline PEth (≥8 ng/ml), and alcohol use data at baseline, 2, and 7 months were included in this analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients were compared to measure the correlation between baseline PEth and number of drinks per week by demographic, biological, and alcohol use factors. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to screen for AUD. Further analyses were stratified by BMI and AUD. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the change in PEth and the change in number of drinks per week over 7 months, including 3 time-points: baseline, 2, and 7 months.  Results:   At baseline, the correlation between baseline PEth and the number of drinks per week was significantly stronger for those with a BMI ≤25 compared to those with a BMI > 25 (r = 0.66; r = 0.26, respectively). Similarly, the correlation between baseline PEth and number of drinks was stronger for those who did not screen positive for AUD compared with those who did (r = 0.66; r = 0.25, respectively). When stratifying by BMI, a low-to-moderate correlation (r = 0.32, p = 0.02) was present for persons with a BMI > 25; when stratifying by AUD, a moderate correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.01) was present for persons without an AUD between 0 and 2 months only.

A convenience sample of 902 Israeli adults (mean age = 46.21) completed measures of peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms and resilience, and reported on their media use experiences one month following the initial outbreak of the disease in Israel (April 2020). After controlling for COVID-19 related events and demographic covariates, experiencing media use as having a negative impact on coping was related to higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of resilience. In contrast, experiencing media as having a positive impact was not related to peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms or resilience. The findings suggest that those reporting that media use had a negative impact on coping are at greater risk of experiencing higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms as well as lower resilience.

Gender differences in latency have been found; however, research in this general area is limited. As cannabis use increases and perceived risk declines, a better understanding of how these factors interact in predicting treatment outcomes is critical.  Methods:   A secondary data analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trial for cannabis dependence (N = 302) examined the associations between age of cannabis use onset, time to cannabis dependence (latency), and gender on cannabis use during the trial. Mediation analysis tested whether the association between age of onset and cannabis use during the trial was mediated by latency to cannabis dependence differentially for men and women.  Results:   Age of use initiation was inversely correlated with latency to dependence prior to treatment [HR(95% CI) = 1.18 (1.06, 1.30); p = .002] and cannabis use during treatment (β=-1.27; SE = 0.37; p < .001). There was a significant mediation effect between age of onset, latency, and cannabis use that varied by gender. Earlier age of onset predicted longer latency, and subsequently, greater cannabis use during the trial in men (21.4% mediated; p < .05), but not women. Other substance use, race, and past psychiatric diagnosis did not predict latency either independently or in interaction models.  Conclusion:   Findings support existing evidence that early cannabis use onset is associated with worse outcomes and add new knowledge on the differential associations between age of onset, latency to cannabis dependence, and treatment outcomes for men and women.""","""['Brian J Sherman', 'Nathaniel L Baker', 'Katherine M Schmarder', 'Aimee L McRae-Clark', 'Kevin M Gray']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.

Cigarettes have been historically used to control weight. Little is known about use of non-cigarette products for weight control, particularly among non-college young adults. Tobacco use in the military is higher than civilians, and personnel have increased motivation for weight control due to military fitness standards. This population might be vulnerable to use tobacco for this purpose. Purpose: Exploring prevalence, as well as demographic and behavioral correlates, of using tobacco products for weight control, among a large, diverse sample of military young adults. Methods: U.S. Air Force recruits (N = 24,543) completed a questionnaire about tobacco use. Among users of tobacco products, recruits reported if they had ever used that product to maintain their weight. Results: Smokeless tobacco was most commonly used for weight control (12.2%), followed by cigarettes (7.3%), e-cigarettes (5.5%), cigarillos (3.3%), and hookah/pipe (3.2%). Using tobacco for weight control was associated with fewer harm beliefs and more regular use of that product. Among e-cigarette users, having a higher BMI and a lower educational background was associated with ever using this product for weight control. Conclusions: The belief that a tobacco product helps control one's weight might increase the prevalence, and frequency of use, of that product among military young adults. Tobacco cessation programs should assess for this motivation of use and provide education about tobacco harm and alternative strategies for weight maintenance.""","""['M C Fahey', 'M A Little', 'R C Klesges', 'G W Talcott', 'P A Richey', 'K Mehmet', 'R A Krukowski']""","""[' Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', ' Department of Public Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', ' Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021;56(""","""Subst Use Misuse""","""['Trends in Tobacco Use among Young Adults Presenting for Military Service in the United States Air Force between 2013 and 2018.', 'When, How, & Where Tobacco Initiation and Relapse Occur During U.S. Air Force Technical Training.', 'Openness to Using Non-cigarette Tobacco Products Among U.S. Young Adults.', 'Efficacy of a Brief Tobacco Intervention for Tobacco and Nicotine Containing Product Use in the US Air Force.', 'Correlates of cigarette and alternative tobacco product use among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness.', 'Prospective Associations of Tobacco Weight Control Beliefs with E-Cigarette Use Patterns in the PATH Study.']"""

This study sought to determine the incidence of helmeted riders among pediatric bicyclists involved in a collision and hypothesized the risk of a serious head and cervical spine injuries to be higher in nonhelmeted bicyclists (NHBs) compared with helmeted bicyclists (HBs).  Methods:   The Pediatric Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2014-2016) was queried for pediatric (age <16 years) bicyclists involved in a collision. Helmeted bicyclists were compared with NHBs. A serious injury was defined by an abbreviated injury scale grade of greater than 2.  Results:   From 3693 bicyclists, 3039 (82.3%) were NHBs. Compared with HBs, NHBs were more often Black (21.6% vs 3.8%, P < 0.001), Hispanic (17.5% vs 9.3%, P < 0.001), without insurance (4.6% vs 2.4%, P = 0.012), and had a higher rate of a serious head injury (24.6% vs 9.3%, P < 0.001). Both groups had similar rates of complications and mortality (P > 0.05). The associated risk of a serious head (odds ratio = 3.17, P < 0.001) and spine injury (odds ratio = 0.41, P = 0.012) were higher and lower respectively in NHBs. Associated risks for cervical spine fracture or cord injury were similar (P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Pediatric bicyclists involved in a collision infrequently wear helmets, and NHBs was associated with higher risks of serious head injury. However, the associated risk of serious spine injury among NHBs was lower. The associated risks for cervical spine fracture or cervical cord injuries were similar. Nonhelmeted bicyclists were more likely to lack insurance and to be Black or Hispanic.

However, they suffer from several drawbacks: (a) Not all the variance components of the outcome variable Y are related to the effect of moderation, and so an effect size with the total variance of Y as the denominator cannot accurately characterize the moderation effect; (b) moderation and interaction are conflated; and (c) the assumption of homoscedasticity might be violated when moderation exists. By arguing that measures for the size of moderation effect should be based on the variance of the outcome Y via the predictor variable X (i.e., X→Y), this article develops a new conceptualization of moderation effects that leads to 2 ways of defining new measures of moderation effects size. One is by using regression models that include the moderator, the predictor, and the product term sequentially. The other is based on a variance decomposition of the outcome variable Y. These new effect size measures effectively differentiate the role of the predictor variable from that of the moderator variable. Two empirical examples are provided to contrast the new measures against the traditional ΔR2 and f2, and to illustrate the applications of the new ones. R code is also provided for researchers to compute the new effect size measures.

However, its genetic bases and tissues of origin remain largely unknown. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated nucleotide variants in non-coding sequences that control genes with important roles in cartilage, muscle, bone, connective tissue and intervertebral disks (IVDs) as drivers of AIS susceptibility. Here, we set out to define the expression of AIS-associated genes and active regulatory elements by performing RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing against H3 lysine 27 acetylation in these tissues in mouse and human. Our study highlights genetic pathways involving AIS-associated loci that regulate chondrogenesis, IVD development and connective tissue maintenance and homeostasis. In addition, we identify thousands of putative AIS-associated regulatory elements which may orchestrate tissue-specific expression in musculoskeletal tissues of the spine. Quantification of enhancer activity of several candidate regulatory elements from our study identifies three functional enhancers carrying AIS-associated GWAS SNPs at the ADGRG6 and BNC2 loci. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide catalog of AIS-relevant genes and regulatory elements and aid in the identification of novel targets for AIS causality and treatment.""","""['Nadja Makki', 'Jingjing Zhao', 'Zhaoyang Liu', 'Walter L Eckalbar', 'Aki Ushiki', 'Anas M Khanshour', 'Joe Wu', 'Jonathan Rios', 'Ryan S Gray', 'Carol A Wise', 'Nadav Ahituv']""","""[' Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.', ' Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ' Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ' Department of Pediatrics and Nutritional Sciences, Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', ' Center for Pediatric Bone Biology and Translational Research, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, Dallas, TX, USA.', ' Health Science Center Libraries, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', ' McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development and Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['An adhesion G protein-coupled receptor is required in cartilaginous and dense connective tissues to maintain spine alignment.', 'Replication Study for the Association of GWAS-associated Loci With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Susceptibility and Curve Progression in a Chinese Population.', 'A Functional SNP in BNC2 Is Associated with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.', 'Association between common variants near LBX1 and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis replicated in the Chinese Han population.', 'Genome-wide association study for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.', 'Ancestry- and sex-specific effects underlying inguinal hernia susceptibility identified in a multiethnic genome-wide association study meta-analysis.', 'An adhesion G protein-coupled receptor is required in cartilaginous and dense connective tissues to maintain spine alignment.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a survey of US households from February 28 through March 2, 2020, using a probability-based web-panel survey of 1021 US residents. To assess knowledge about COVID-19, we asked respondents a series of 16 true/false questions. We conducted descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses to examine differences in knowledge scores based on demographic and background characteristics.  Results:   Knowledge about COVID-19 and the virus was relatively low overall at the beginning of the outbreak, with average scores of 62% on a 16-item knowledge index (ie, answers for 6 of the 16 questions were incorrect or unknown). Knowledge was especially low among people who had low education and income levels, were unemployed, were Hispanic, were non-Hispanic Black, were aged 18-24 and 35-49, indicated having ""other"" health insurance, and had limited exposure to information about the pandemic. Non-Hispanic Black respondents were less knowledgeable about COVID-19 and the virus at every education level compared with non-Hispanic White respondents at higher education levels.

Hierarchical, mixed effects, repeated-measures analyses were used to assess partner-level (demographic) and individual-level (demographic and behavioral) factors associated with recent (past 6 months) HAI. Thirty-two percent of participants (n = 243) reported HAI with at least one recent sex partner, and 49% reported ever having anal intercourse (AI). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, HAI was more than twice as likely to occur in relationships (n = 503) lasting more than a year compared to relationships lasting less than one month. HAI was also more likely to occur in relationships where intimate partner violence (IPV) was reported either as IPV initiated by the respondent (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.08-4.41) or IPV initiated by the partner (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.27-4.47).

CMV has been associated with alterations of the immune compartment leading to improved responses, while inflammation has been shown to adversely impact outcomes. We investigated whether CMV serostatus predicts outcomes in ovarian cancer in the presence or absence of inflammation.  Methods:   A total of 106 patients with serous ovarian cancer from 2006 to 2009 were analyzed. CMV and systemic inflammation was measured using CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively, in serum collected prior to cytoreduction. Patients were stratified by CMV IgG (non-reactive, reactive/borderline) and CRP (≤10, >10 mg/L) status. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared by group using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for age at surgery.  Results:   Of 106 eligible patients, 40 (37.7%) were CMV+/CRP+, 24 (22.6%) CMV+/CRP-, 19 (17.9%) CMV-/CRP+, and 23 (21.7%) CMV-/CRP-. CRP+ had higher CA-125 levels (P = 0.05) and higher rates of suboptimal debulking (P = 0.03). There were no other significant differences in demographic, surgical, or pathologic factors between groups. CMV+/CRP+ patients median RFS and OS were 16.9 months (95% CI: 9.0-21.1) and 31.7 months (95% CI: 25.0-48.7), respectively, with a significantly worse RFS (aHR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.05-3.24, P = 0.03) and OS (aHR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.17-3.82, P = 0.01) compared to CMV-/CRP- (RFS = 31.2 months (95% CI: 16.0-56.4) and OS = 63.8 months (95% CI: 50.7-87.0)). CMV+/CRP- group displayed the longest OS (89.3 months).  Conclusions:   Previous exposure to CMV and high CRP at surgery portended worse RFS and OS compared to women who tested negative. The CMV+/CRP- group had the longest OS, indicating that CMV status alone, in the absence of inflammation, may be protective.""","""['Erin Wesley', 'Locke D Uppendahl', 'Martin Felices', 'Carly Dahl', 'Audrey Messelt', 'Kristin L M Boylan', 'Amy P N Skubitz', 'Rachel I Vogel', 'Heather H Nelson', 'Melissa A Geller']""","""["" Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States."", ' Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', ' Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', ' Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', "" Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States."", ' Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', "" Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.

MetS and its components (glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, adiposity) were defined using the National Institutes of Health criteria. Neither the presence of MetS nor the MetS score was associated with Aβ or neurodegeneration. Among the MetS components, elevated glucose was associated with lower Aβ burden, and this association was not explained by diabetes treatment.

Methods:   This study assessed area-level markers for region, race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, and smoke-free law coverage as predictors of Tobacco 21 passage as of December 20, 2019, using modified Poisson and negative binomial regression models with robust SEs. Data were analyzed in 2020.  Results:   Before the passage of the national policy, 191 million people were covered by Tobacco 21 laws. Counties with higher percentages of non-Hispanic Blacks and individuals living below the poverty line had a lower probability of coverage, whereas counties with higher percentages of Hispanics/Latinxs and individuals with a college degree had a higher probability of coverage. Tobacco 21 coverage also varied by region, with far greater coverage in the Northeast than in the Midwest and South.  Conclusions:   The national Tobacco 21 law may address disparities in coverage by SES, race/ethnicity, and region that could have lasting implications with regard to health equity.""","""['David C Colston', 'Andrea R Titus', 'James F Thrasher', 'Michael R Elliott', 'Nancy L Fleischer']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Neuronal extracellular vesicle levels of phosphorylated insulin signaling cascade proteins were quantified. Brain volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume were assessed using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. After adjusting for demographic variables and extracellular vesicle marker Alix, higher levels of a neuronal insulin signaling composite measure were associated with lower WMH and greater temporal lobe volume. Secondary analyses found the levels of downstream protein kinases involved in cell survival (p70S6K) and tau phosphorylation/neuroinflammation (GSK-3β) to be most strongly associated with WMH and temporal lobe volume, respectively. Associations between neuronal insulin signaling and lower WMH volume were attenuated in participants with elevated cortical amyloid.

Objective:   We sought to characterize kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) within a randomized controlled trial in the Peruvian Andes. The intervention included the provision of an LPG stove and continuous fuel distribution with behavioral messaging to maximize compliance.  Methods:   We measured 48-hour kitchen area NO2 concentrations at high temporal resolution in homes of 50 intervention participants and 50 control participants longitudinally within a biomass-to-LPG intervention trial. We also collected 48-hour mean personal exposures to NO2 among a subsample of 16 intervention and 9 control participants. We monitored LPG and biomass stove use continuously throughout the trial.  Results:   In 367 post-intervention 24-hour kitchen area samples of 96 participants' homes, geometric mean (GM) highest hourly NO2 concentration was 138 ppb (geometric standard deviation [GSD] 2.1) in the LPG intervention group and 450 ppb (GSD 3.1) in the biomass control group. Post-intervention 24-hour mean NO2 concentrations were a GM of 43 ppb (GSD 1.7) in the intervention group and 77 ppb (GSD 2.0) in the control group. Kitchen area NO2 concentrations exceeded the WHO indoor hourly guideline an average of 1.3 h per day among LPG intervention participants. GM 48-hour personal exposure to NO2 was 5 ppb (GSD 2.4) among 35 48-hour samples of 16 participants in the intervention group and 16 ppb (GSD 2.3) among 21 samples of 9 participants in the control group.  Discussion:   In a biomass-to-LPG intervention trial in Peru, kitchen area NO2 concentrations were substantially lower within the LPG intervention group compared to the biomass-using control group. However, within the LPG intervention group, 69% of 24-hour kitchen area samples exceeded WHO indoor annual guidelines and 47% of samples exceeded WHO indoor hourly guidelines. Forty-eight-hour NO2 personal exposure was below WHO indoor annual guidelines for most participants in the LPG intervention group, and we did not measure personal exposure at high temporal resolution to assess exposure to cooking-related indoor concentration peaks.

Methods:   An ethnically/socioeconomically diverse sample of 751 sixth-graders (mean age 11.5 years) across 14 schools in Texas were block-randomized by school (2011-2012) to receive singly or in combination: (1) a mental illness anti-stigma curriculum; (2) contact with 2 young adults with mental illness; or (3) merged control (printed materials/no intervention). Pre- and post-test assessments were self-completed during health education classes; prior to randomization, 484 (64.5%) agreed to 2-year, home-based longitudinal assessments. Statistical models tested short- and long-term effects on physical, verbal, and relational/social violence victimization/perpetration.  Results:   At 1-month post-test, students who received the curriculum versus control made fewer verbal threats (p < .05). Those with high-level mental health symptoms in the curriculum group versus control used less violence overall and received fewer verbal threats from peers short-term (p < .05). Curriculum effects of reducing violence perpetration sustained long-term among adolescents with high-symptoms (p < .01). The comparator contact intervention was ineffective short- and long-term.

Therefore, we assessed the association between concurrent antibiotic administration at insertion and short-term catheter-related infections.  Methods:   We used individual data gathered from five large, randomized, controlled ICU trials. We analysed adult patients who required arterial, short-term central venous or dialysis catheter insertion in the ICU. The effect of antibiotics at insertion on major catheter-related infection (MCRI), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and colonization was estimated using multivariate marginal Cox and propensity score models.  Results:   We included 10 269 patients and 18 743 catheters from 36 ICUs. Antibiotic use was ongoing at the time of 11 361 catheter insertions (60.6%). After adjusting for well-known risk factors for intravascular catheter infection, we observed a similar risk for MCRI (HR 0.83, 95%CI 0.62-1.10, p 0.19) and CRBSI (HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.60-1.22, p 0.38) between the antibiotic and no-antibiotic groups. A confirmatory analysis using propensity score showed consistent results. No specific antibiotic subclasses reduced the risk of MCRI. Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli were more frequently observed in the antibiotic group.  Conclusions:   Ongoing antibiotic administration at the time of catheter insertion was not associated with a decrease risk of catheter-related infections and should not be carried out for preventing such infections. Our results bring new insights to antimicrobial stewardship in critically ill patients and may direct empirical antimicrobial therapy if an intravascular catheter infection is suspected.""","""['Niccolò Buetti', 'Bertrand Souweine', 'Leonard Mermel', 'Olivier Mimoz', 'Stéphane Ruckly', 'Ambre Loiodice', 'Nicolas Mongardon', 'Jean-Christophe Lucet', 'Jean-Jacques Parienti', 'Jean-François Timsit']""","""[' University of Paris, INSERM, IAME, F-75006, Paris, France; Infection Control Program and WHO Collaborating Centre on Patient Safety, University of Geneva Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland.

Methods:   Pediatric patients <18 years old with in-hospital cardiac arrest recorded in the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database between 2002 and 2018 were included. The annual adjusted odds of receiving each intra-arrest medication was determined. The association between changes in the PALS Guidelines and medication use over time was assessed interrupted time series analyses.  Results:   A total of 6107 patients were analyzed. The adjusted odds of receiving lidocaine (0.33; 95% CI, 0.18, 0.61; p < 0.001), atropine (0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.30; p < 0.001) and bicarbonate (0.54; 95% CI 0.35, 0.86; p = 0.009) were lower in 2018 compared to 2002. For lidocaine, there were no significant changes in the step (-2.1%; 95% CI, -5.9%, 1.6%; p = 0.27) after the 2010 or 2015 (Step: -1.5%; 95% CI, -8.0%, 5.0; p = 0.65) guideline releases. There were no significant changes in the step for bicarbonate (-2.3%; 95% CI, -7.6%, 3.0%; p = 0.39) after the 2010 updates. For atropine, there was a downward step change after the 2010 guideline release (-5.9%; 95% CI, -10.5%, -1.3%; p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   Changes to the PALS guidelines for lidocaine and bicarbonate were not temporally associated with acute changes in the use of these medications; however, better alignment with these updates was observed over time. A minor update to the language surrounding atropine in the PALS text was associated with a modest acute change in the observed use of atropine.

The aim of this study was to explore antimalarial resistance in Bangladesh by molecular analysis of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance transporter 1 (pfmdr1) genetic markers of P. falciparum. Samples were obtained from uncomplicated malaria patients between 2009 and 2014 from six malaria-endemic districts. Based on parasite transmission intensity, the endemic districts were divided into high-transmission (Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT]) and low-transmission (non-CHT) regions. Falciparum malaria-positive isolates were genotyped for K76T of the pfcrt gene, and N86Y and Y184F of the pfmdr1 gene: in total, 262 P. falciparum clinical isolates were analyzed. In CHT areas, the prevalence of polymorphisms was 70.6% for 76T, 14.4% for 86Y, and 7.8% for 184F. In non-CHT areas, 76T and 86Y mutations were found in 78.0% and 19.5% of the samples, respectively, whereas no 184F mutations were observed. We compared our data with previous similar molecular observations, which shows a significant decrease in pfcrt 76T mutation prevalence. No pfmdr1 amplification was observed in any of the samples suggesting an unaltered susceptibility to amino alcohol drugs such as mefloquine and lumefantrine.

Emergency departments (EDs) may serve as an effective, nontraditional setting to screen for chlamydia/gonorrhea (CT/GC). The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a universally offered CT/GC screening program in two pediatric ED settings.  Methods:   This was a prospective, delayed start pragmatic study conducted over 18 months in two EDs within the same academic institution among ED adolescents aged 14-21 years with any chief complaint. Using a tablet device, adolescents were confidentially informed of CT/GC screening recommendations and were offered screening. If patients agreed to CT/GC testing, a clinical decision support tool was triggered to inform the provider and order testing. The main and key secondary outcomes were the proportion of CT/GC testing and positive CT/GC test results in each respective ED.  Results:   Both EDs experienced modest but statistically significant increases in CT/GC testing post- versus pre-intervention (main: 11.5% vs. 7.9%; confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-4.2; p < .0001 and satellite: 3.8% vs. 2.6%; 95% CI: .7-1.7; p < .0001). Among those tested, the positivity rate at the main ED did not significantly change post- versus pre-intervention (24.1% vs. 23.2%; 95% CI: -1.9 to 3.8; p = .71) but significantly decreased at the satellite ED (7.6% vs. 14.8%; 95% CI: -12.2 to -2.2; p = .01).  Conclusions:   A universally offered screening intervention increased the proportion of adolescents who were tested at both EDs and the detection rates for CT/GC at the main ED, but patient acceptance of screening was low.""","""['Jennifer L Reed', 'Evaline A Alessandrini', 'Judith Dexheimer', 'Andrea Kachelmeyer', 'Maurizio Macaluso', 'Nanhua Zhang', 'Jessica A Kahn']""","""["" Division of Emergency Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Method: The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, 2012-2013, sampled, recruited, and assessed 36,309 adults, with interviews on drug use and other characteristics. The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule DSM-5 Version (AUDADIS-5) was used to identify psychiatric conditions. Latent class models were developed based on various psychiatric diagnoses. Multinomial logistic regression estimated the significance of covariates in predicting class membership. Results: Four latent classes optimally distinguished the population: no comorbid conditions (63%), comorbid affective disorders (16%), those with alcohol use disorder (AUD; 17%), and a highly comorbid subgroup (i.e., co-occurring affective and drug use disorders; 4%). Current smoking was about twice as prevalent in the classes defined by psychiatric conditions compared to the group with no comorbid conditions. The highly comorbid class was more likely to be current smokers than the comorbid affective disorders class and the AUD class. Furthermore, the highly comorbid class was younger and had lower income, and the AUD class had a higher proportion of males than the other classes. Conclusions: Cigarette smoking was higher in the nearly 40% of respondents characterized by psychiatric disorders, particularly those with drug use disorders. Correlates of membership in these classes were consistent with known vulnerabilities for smoking, highlighting the need for mental health interventions and future research to explicitly address tobacco cessation in clinical settings based on psychiatric diagnoses.""","""['Maria A Parker', 'Andrea C Villanti']""","""[' Vermont Center on Behavior & Health, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA.', ' School of Public Health, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021;56(""","""Subst Use Misuse""","""['Higher smoking prevalence among United States adults with co-occurring affective and drug use diagnoses.', 'Psychiatric comorbidity and perceived alcohol stigma in a nationally representative sample of individuals with DSM-5 alcohol use disorder.', 'Clinical presentations, social functioning, and treatment receipt among individuals with comorbid life-time PTSD and alcohol use disorders versus drug use disorders: findings from NESARC-III.', 'Sex differences in prevalence and comorbidity of alcohol and drug use disorders: results from wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Relating individual differences in the reinforcing value of smoking and dependence severity to nicotine exposure levels in vulnerable populations.', 'COVID-related distress, mental health, and substance use in adolescents and young adults.', 'Cumulative vulnerabilities as a potential moderator of response to reduced nicotine content cigarettes.']"""

This arises because biological offspring inherit both their genotypes and rearing environment from their parents. We tested for passive gene-environment correlation in adult body composition traits using the 'natural experiment' of childhood adoption, which removes passive gene-environment correlation within families. Specifically, we compared 6165 adoptees with propensity score matched non-adoptees in the UK Biobank. We also tested whether passive gene-environment correlation inflates the association between psychiatric genetic risk and body composition. We found no evidence for inflation of heritability or polygenic scores in non-adoptees compared to adoptees for a range of body composition traits. Furthermore, polygenic risk scores for anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia did not differ in their influence on body composition traits in adoptees and non-adoptees. These findings suggest that passive gene-environment correlation does not inflate genetic effects for body composition, or the influence of psychiatric disorder genetic risk on body composition. Our design does not look at passive gene-environment correlation in childhood, and does not test for 'pure' environmental effects or the effects of active and evocative gene-environment correlations, where child genetics directly influences home environment. However, these findings suggest that genetic influences identified for body composition in this adult sample are direct, and not confounded by the family environment provided by biological relatives.""","""['Avina K Hunjan', 'Rosa Cheesman', 'Jonathan R I Coleman', 'Christopher Hübel', 'Thalia C Eley', 'Gerome Breen']""","""["" Social Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", ' NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK.', ' Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', ' National Centre for Register-based Research, Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', "" Social Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. gerome.breen@kcl.ac.uk."", ' NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK. gerome.breen@kcl.ac.uk.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Behav Genet""","""['Comparison of Adopted and Nonadopted Individuals Reveals Gene-Environment Interplay for Education in the UK Biobank.', 'Childhood Adoption and Mental Health in Adulthood: The Role of Gene-Environment Correlations and Interactions in the UK Biobank.', 'Association Between Genetic Risk for Psychiatric Disorders and the Probability of Living in Urban Settings.', 'Adoption study of environmental modifications of the genetic influences on obesity.', 'Understanding the relative contributions of direct environmental effects and passive genotype-environment correlations in the association between familial risk factors and child disruptive behavior disorders.']"""

This study seeks to further explore this relationship in the context of the recent opioid crisis in which millions of Americans have been diagnosed with an opioid use disorder. Specifically, we analyze how opioid prescriptions relate to intimate partner violence within and between counties over time throughout the rise of the opioid crisis.  Methods:   This study employs an integrated dataset that merges crime data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demographic data from the American Community Survey, and prescription opioid pill counts from the Drug Enforcement Administration to study the relationship between opioid pills prescribed per person and levels of intimate partner violence arrests from 2006-2012. Fixed-effects and mixed-effects techniques are both used.  Results:   Increases in opioid pill distribution volume within-counties over time are related to increases in intimate partner violence arrest volume (p ≤ .001). Additionally, counties which have higher amounts of opioid pills in circulation tend to experience higher levels of arrests for intimate partner violence than counties with fewer pills (p ≤ .001).  Conclusions:   Policymakers who are dealing with the effects of the opioid crisis should consider the relationship between opioids and intimate partner violence when attempting to address either of these issues. Based on the results of this study, addressing opioid dependence and mitigating the extent of the crisis may also reduce intimate partner violence.""","""['Cori Pryor', 'John H Boman th', 'Paul Hemez']""","""[' Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, United States.

Despite the focus on treatment deintensification in clinical trials, little is known about the preferences, experiences and needs of patients with OPSCC when deciding between surgery and radiation therapy as primary treatment with curative intent. In this qualitative study, pre-treatment and post-treatment oropharyngeal cancer patients were recruited to take part in one-on-one interviews (n = 11 pre-treatment) and focus group discussions (n = 15 post-treatment) about treatment decision-making. Recordings were transcribed and assessed for emergent themes using framework analysis. From the one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions with OPSCC patients, fourteen themes were identified. Participants expressed alarm at diagnosis, decisional conflict, and a variety of roles in decision-making (physician-controlled, shared, and autonomous). Decisions were driven by the perceived recommendation of the treatment team, a desire for physical (surgical) tumor removal, fear of adverse effects of treatment, and patient-specific values.

The aim of this paper is to examine depression over two years in a large sample of CHR youth who do not make the transition to psychosis, considering both categorical and dimensional ratings of depression severity. The sample consisted of 267 CHR youth who were followed for two years. Based on DSM-IV diagnoses over this time period, 100 CHR individuals never received a diagnosis of depression, 64 individuals continuously met criteria for depression, 92 individuals received a diagnosis of depression at one or more timepoints, and 11 participants had a diagnosis of depression only at 24-months. These groupings were supported by six-monthly ratings on the Calgary Depression Scale. The majority of this sample experienced a major depressive episode on more than one occasion, suggesting that depression and depressive symptoms identify a domain of substantial unmet clinical need. Recommendations are that depression in CHR youth and young adults should be monitored more frequently and that there is a need for clinical trials to address depression systematically in this vulnerable population.""","""['Jean Addington', 'Megan S Farris', 'Lu Liu', 'Kristin S Cadenhead', 'Tyrone D Cannon', 'Barbara A Cornblatt', 'Thomas H McGlashan', 'Diana O Perkins', 'Larry J Seidman', 'Ming T Tsuang', 'Elaine F Walker', 'Carrie E Bearden', 'Daniel H Mathalon', 'William S Stone', 'Matcheri Keshevan', 'Scott W Woods']""","""[' Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Department of Psychiatry, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

However, further exploration of the intersectional nature of this vulnerability is warranted. California's Central Valley is a largely rural/suburban and politically conservative area, with high rates of injection drug use and overdose mortality, where rates of abusive policing of PWID have not been characterized.  Methods:   We assessed self-reported experiences of abusive policing using a sequential mixed-methods approach, consisting of n = 54 in-depth qualitative interviews followed by a respondent driven survey of n = 494 PWID. Qualitative conclusions were used to guide the development a novel quantitative framework to explore intersectional structural vulnerability, drawing on UpSet visualization and multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Qualitative analysis suggests that abusive policing is not random or isolated; instead it can be understood in the context of routinized police harassment of PWID, which can escalate into physical or other forms of violence. These cycles are mediated by various forms of social disadvantage-often articulated through the frame of ""looking like a drug user""-with deep connections to markers of race, class, gender, occupation and other elements of personal identity. Quantitative results confirm high frequency of abusive encounters with police, including physical violence (42%), verbal abuse (62%), sexual violence (9%), and the confiscation of new/unused syringes (39%). Females report higher rates of sexual violence and exploitation (aOR= 4.2; 95% CI: 2.1-9.0) and males report higher rates of physical violence (aOR=3.6; 95% CI: 2.4-5.6) and all other outcomes. Experiencing homelessness, having traded sex, and living in a rural zip code, are independently associated with numerous forms of police abuse. Intersectional analysis reveals clusters of individuals with highly elevated vulnerability, and in general, having a greater number of vulnerability factors was associated with increased odds of police abuse.  Conclusions:   We find that structural vulnerability is linked-in a highly intersectional manner-with experiencing abusive police encounters among PWID in California's Central Valley. Monitoring, prevention, and response to deleterious law enforcement practices must be integrated into structural interventions to protect vulnerable groups. Reform is especially urgent in rural/suburban areas that are increasingly important focal points to reduce social and health harms associated with injection drug use.""","""['Joseph Friedman', 'Jennifer L Syvertsen', 'Philippe Bourgois', 'Alex Bui', 'Leo Beletsky', 'Robin Pollini']""","""[' Center for Social Medicine and Humanities, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', ' Department of Anthropology, University of California, Riverside, California, United States.', ' Department of Radiological Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, California, United States.', ' School of Law, Department of Health Sciences, and Health in Justice Action Lab, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', ' Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, United States; Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Beltsville, Maryland, United States.

Methods:   Patients anticipated to undergo gastric cancer resection were invited to complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 and STO22 surveys in the preoperative setting and at 0-1.5 months (early), > 1.5-6 months (intermediate), and > 6-18 months (late) following resection. Quality-of-life recovery was measured as paired differences between pre- and postoperative results. Multivariable linear regression identified factors associated with preoperative quality of life and degree of change following resection.  Results:   Across 393 participants, response rates at the intermediate and late postoperative time points were 58% (n = 228) and 71% (n = 277), respectively. Relative to baseline, median global health scale decreased in the early (- 15.1 pts, p < 0.001) and intermediate (- 3.6 pts, p = 0.02) time points, but recovered by the late time point (+ 1.2 pts, p = 0.411). Relative to distal/subtotal gastrectomy, proximal/total gastrectomy was associated with worse recovery in both the early and late time points. Surgical complications were associated with worse early recovery. Patients who presented with locally advanced tumors (T3-T4) had lower preoperative quality-of-life scores, and more readily recovered to baseline after surgery. A minimally invasive approach was not associated with postoperative recovery.  Conclusions:   Most patients recover to baseline within 1 year following major gastrectomy, and recovery is easier with more limited resections. Patients with locally advanced tumors tend to have poorer baseline quality of life, which may improve following resection.""","""['Yinin Hu', 'Elvira L Vos', 'Raymond E Baser', 'Mark A Schattner', 'Makoto Nishimura', 'Daniel G Coit', 'Vivian E Strong']""","""[' Division of General and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Maryland Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ' Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. strongv@mskcc.org.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Assessment of quality of life after gastrectomy using EORTC QLQ-C30 and STO22.', 'Quality of life beyond the early postoperative period after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy: the level of patient expectation as the essence of quality of life.', 'Quality of life after gastrectomy for cancer evaluated via the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 questionnaires: surgical considerations from the analysis of 103 patients.', 'Current advances and changes in treatment strategy may improve survival and quality of life in patients with potentially curable gastric cancer.', 'Minimally Invasive Versus Open Total Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Short-Term Outcomes and Completeness of Resection : Surgical Techniques in Gastric Cancer.', 'Impact of Body Composition and Physical Function on Quality of Life After Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer.']"""

Economic burden estimates that describe the impact of the crisis are needed when considering federal and state resources devoted to addressing overdoses. In this study, we estimate the societal costs for opioid use disorder and fatal overdose from all opioids in 2017.  Methods:   We estimated costs of fatal overdose from all opioids and opioid use disorder based on the incidence of overdose deaths and the prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder for 2017. Incidence of fatal opioid overdose was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System; prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder was estimated from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Costs were estimated for health care, criminal justice and lost productivity. Costs for the reduced quality of life for opioid use disorder and life lost due to fatal opioid overdose were valued using U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for valuing reductions in morbidity and mortality.  Results:   Costs for opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in 2017 were estimated to be $1.02 trillion. The majority of the economic burden is due to reduced quality of life from opioid use disorder and the value of life lost due to fatal opioid overdose.  Conclusions:   These estimates can assist decision makers in understanding the magnitude of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose.

We performed GWASs of DNA methylation in brain tissues from 592 participants and mapped 60,595 cis-SNP-CpG pairs after correction for multiple testing. By linking cis-DNA methylation quantitative trait locus with GWAS results for Aβ load and tau tangles, we identified 47 CpGs showing pleiotropic association with Aβ load by the Mendelian randomization analysis. We then used gene expression data from 537 individuals and performed quantitative trait methylation analysis.

However, it is unclear how seasonal changes in water availability and drinking water source types affect enteric infections in young children. This study investigated seasonal shifts in primary drinking water source type and the effect of water source type on enteric pathogen prevalence in stool samples from 404 children below age 5 in rural communities in Limpopo Province, South Africa. From wet to dry season, 4.6% (n = 16) of households switched from a source with a higher risk of contamination to a source with lower risk, with the majority switching to municipal water during the dry season. In contrast, 2.6% (n = 9) of households switched from a source with a lower risk of contamination to a source with higher risk. 74.5% (n = 301) of the total households experienced interruptions in their water supply, regardless of source type. There were no significant differences in enteric pathogen prevalence between drinking water sources. Intermittent municipal water distribution and household water use and storage practices may have a larger impact on enteric infections than water source type.

Methods:   Two specimen collection devices (OC-Sensor, OC-S; HM-JACKarc, HM-J) were sent to 914 consecutive individuals referred for follow up due to their increased risk of CRC. Agreement of f-Hb around cut-offs of 4, 10 and 150 µg Hb/g faeces and CRC detection rates were assessed. Two OC-S devices were sent to a further 114 individuals, for within test comparisons.  Results:   A total of 732 (80.1%) individuals correctly completed and returned two different FIT devices, with 38 (5.2%) CRCs detected. Median f-Hb for individuals diagnosed with and without CRC were 258.5 and 1.8 µg Hb/g faeces for OC-S and 318.1 and 1.0 µg Hb/g faeces for HM-J respectively.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19.  Methods:   Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics.  Results:   Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset.  Conclusions:   In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.""","""['Tristan D McPherson', 'Isaac Ghinai', 'Alison M Binder', 'Brandi D Freeman', 'Chantel Hoskin Snelling', 'Jennifer C Hunter', 'Kristin M Anderson', 'Polly Davenport', 'Deborah L Rudd', 'Mujeeb Zafer', 'Demian Christiansen', 'Kiran Joshi', 'Rachel Rubin', 'Stephanie R Black', 'Marielle J Fricchione', 'Massimo Pacilli', 'Kelly A Walblay', 'Jacqueline Korpics', 'Darcie Moeller', 'Pearl Quartey-Kumapley', 'Chen Wang', 'E Matt Charles', 'Judy Kauerauf', 'Megan T Patel', 'Vishal S Disari', 'Marc Fischer', 'Max W Jacobs', 'Sandra N Lester', 'Claire M Midgley', 'Mohammed Ata Ur Rasheed', 'Heather E Reese', 'Jennifer R Verani', 'Megan Wallace', 'John T Watson', 'Natalie J Thornburg', 'Jennifer E Layden', 'Hannah L Kirking']""","""[' 1242 Epidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ' 11056 Chicago Department of Public Health, Chicago, IL, USA.', ' 7455 Illinois Department of Public Health, Springfield, IL, USA.', ' 1242 National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ' 1242 Laboratory Leadership Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ' 1242 National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ' 21862 AMITA Health, St. Alexius Medical Center, Hoffman Estates, IL, USA.', ' 6144 Cook County Department of Public Health, Oak Forest, IL, USA.', ' 6144 Cook County Health, Chicago, IL, USA.', '0 Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', '1 Boonshoft School of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA.', '2 Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Erie, PA, USA.', '3 Synergy America, Inc, Duluth, GA, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Public Health Rep""","""['Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity Among US Health Care Personnel.', 'SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and transmission risk factors among high-risk close contacts: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Investigation and Serologic Follow-Up of Contacts of an Early Confirmed Case-Patient with COVID-19, Washington, USA.', 'First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Exposure and Infection Among Health Care Personnel - Minnesota, March 6-July 11, 2020.', 'Missing science: A scoping study of COVID-19 epidemiological data in the United States.']"""

Self-reported surveys on drug use have inherent limitations that underestimate drug use. We evaluated the performance of linking urine drug testing with a local, representative health examination survey in estimating the prevalence of drug use in New York City (NYC).  Methods:   We used urine drug testing from the NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) to estimate the prevalence of drug use (benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, and opioid analgesics) among the study sample and compare the findings with self-reported responses to questions about past-12-month drug use from the same survey.  Results:   Of 1527 respondents to NYC HANES, urine drug testing was performed on 1297 (84.9%) participants who provided urine and consented to future studies. Self-reported responses gave past-12-month weighted estimates for heroin, cocaine, or any prescription drug misuse of 13.8% (95% CI, 11.6%-16.3%), for prescription drug misuse of 9.9% (95% CI, 8.1%-12.1%), and for heroin or cocaine use of 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7%-7.9%).

Latin American Society of Pediatric Intensive Care Transport Committee""","""Methods:   An electronic, anonymous, multicenter survey housed by Monkey Survey was sent to physicians in LA and included questions about hospital and pediatric critical transport, resources available and level of car. Nineteen Latin-American countries were asked to complete the survey.  Results:   A total of 212 surveys were analyzed, achieving a representativity of 19 LA countries, being most participants (59.4%, n = 126) from South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela). Most surveys were conducted by physicians of tertiary level centers (60.8%, n = 129), most of the institutions were classified by the participants as public health care centers (81.6%, n = 173). Most of the surveyed physicians (63.7%, n = 135) reported that there is a coordination center for critical care transport (CCT). In most cases, physicians report that a unified transport system for pediatric critical patients does not exist in their countries (67.45%, n = 143). Only 59 (30.7%) surveys reported the use of an exclusively pediatric critical care transport system. Most of these transport systems are described as a mixture of public and private efforts (51.56%, n = 99), but there is also a considerable involvement of government-funded critical transport systems (43.75%, n = 84). Specific training for personnel devoted to transportation of critically ill patients is reported in 55.6% (90), and the medical equipment necessary to carry out the transport is available in 67.7%. The majority (83.95%, n = 136) mentioned that access to advanced life support courses is possible. Training in triage and disaster is available in 44.1%. Physicians and registered nurse were identified as the transport providers in 41.5%, and only one third were made by pediatricians-pediatric nurse. The main reasons for transfers were respiratory illness, neonatal pathologies, trauma, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Overall, pediatric transport was reported as insufficient (70.19%, n = 148) by the surveyed physicians in LA and nonexisting by some of them (6.83%, n = 15). There were no regulations or laws in the majority of the surveyed countries (63.13%), and in the places where physicians reported regulatory laws, there were no dissemination (84.9%) by the local authorities.  Conclusions:   In LA, there is a great variability in personnel training, equipment for pediatric-neonatal transport, transport team composition, and characterization of critical care transport systems. Continued efforts to improve conditions in our countries by generating documents that standardize practices and generating scientific information on the epidemiology of pediatric transfers, especially of critically ill patients, may help reduce patient morbidity and mortality.""","""['Adriana Yock-Corrales', 'Nils Casson', 'Giordano Sosa-Soto', 'Renan A Orellana']""","""[' From the Pediatric Emergency Department, Hospital Nacional de Niños ""Dr. Carlos Sáenz Herrera"", CCSS, San José, Costa Rica.', ' Pediatric Critical Care Unit, Hospital Regional San Juan de Dios, Tarija, Bolivia.', "" Pediatric Resident, Children's National Hospital, Washington DC."", "" Pediatric Critical Care Unit, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Emerg Care""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'The practice of intensive care in Latin America: a survey of academic intensivists.', 'Pediatric and neonatal transport in Spain, Portugal and Latin America.', 'Trauma intensive care unit (TICU) at Hamad General Hospital.', 'Evidence Brief: The Quality of Care Provided by Advanced Practice Nurses Internet.']"""

Objective:   To compare the risk of overcorrection in RIB and SCI with hypertonic saline in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 178 patients older than 18 years with moderately severe to severe hyponatremia and glucose-corrected serum sodium (sNa) levels of 125 mmol/L or less. Recruitment took place from August 24, 2016, until August 21, 2019, across emergency departments and wards of 3 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea.  Interventions:   Either RIB or SCI of hypertonic saline, 3%, for 24 to 48 hours stratified by the severity of clinical symptoms.  Main outcome and measures:   The primary outcome was overcorrection at any given period, defined as increase in the sNa level by greater than 12 or 18 mmol/L within 24 or 48 hours, respectively. Secondary and post hoc outcomes included efficacy and safety of the treatment approaches. The sNa concentrations were measured every 6 hours for 2 days.  Results:   The 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [12.2] years; 80 (44.9%) male; mean [SD] sNa concentrations, 118.2 [5.0] mmol/L) were randomly assigned to the RIB group (n = 87) or the SCI group (n = 91). Overcorrection occurred in 15 of 87 (17.2%) and 22 of 91 (24.2%) patients in the RIB and SCI groups, respectively (absolute risk difference, -6.9% [95% CI, -18.8% to 4.9%]; P = .26). The RIB group showed lower incidence of relowering treatment than the SCI group (36 of 87 [41.4%] vs 52 of 91 [57.1%] patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, -15.8% [95% CI, -30.3% to -1.3%]; P = .04; number needed to treat, 6.3). Groups did not differ in terms of efficacy in increasing sNa concentrations nor improving symptoms, but RIB, when compared with SCI, showed better efficacy in achieving target correction rate within 1 hour (intention-to-treat analysis: 28 of 87 (32.2%) vs 16 of 91 (17.6%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 14.6% [95% CI, 2%-27.2%]; P = .02; number needed to treat, 6.8; per-protocol analysis: 21 of 72 (29.2%) vs 12 of 73 (16.4%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 12.7% [95% CI, -0.8% to 26.2%]; P = .07). The statistical significance of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were similar for all outcomes except for achieving the target correction rate within 1 hour.  Conclusions and relevance:   This randomized clinical trial found that both RIB and SIC therapies of hypertonic saline for treating hyponatremia were effective and safe, with no difference in the overcorrection risk. However, RIB had a lower incidence of therapeutic relowering treatment and tended to have a better efficacy in achieving sNa within 1 hour than SCI. RIB could be suggested as the preferred treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, which is consistent with the current consensus guidelines.

Studies are yet to examine dyadic relationships between criminal justice involvement and injection drug and sexual HIV risk behaviors of couples who inject drugs in Kazakhstan. This study examined associations between individual and partner level criminal justice involvement and injection drug and sexual HIV risk behaviors among 216 intimate dyads (n = 432) of PWID in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  Methods:   The Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) using structural equation modeling examined individual (actor), partner and dyadic patterns (actor-partner) of associations between arrest, incarceration and drug crime conviction of dyads of male and female intimate partners of PWID using baseline data from Project Renaissance, a couples-focused HIV prevention intervention for PWID and their intimate partners.  Results:   Results from the APIM identified significant associations between lifetime (β=0.10, CI95%=0.01.20, p=.021) and recent (β=0.12, CI95%=0.01.26, p=.045) arrest and increased risk of injection drug use with any partner for female partners. Partner-only effects were identified in which male PWID's recent arrest was associated with an increase in their study partners' injection drug risk behaviors (β=0.10 CI95%=0.02, 0.20, p=.044). For female partners, prior incarceration was associated with increased engagement in injection drug risk behaviors (β=0.10 CI95% =0.02, 0.20, p=.035) with any partner. For male partners' prior incarceration was associated with injection drug risk behaviors with their study partners (β=0.10 CI95%= 0.02, 0.20. p<.05). Female partners prior drug crime conviction was associated with their own (β=0.14 CI95%=0.01, 0.28, p=.048) and their intimate partners' (β=0.18, CI95%=0.03, 0.33, p=.024) engagement in injection drug risk behaviors with any injecting partner. Recent drug crime conviction (β=0.12, CI95%=0.01, 0.24, p=.038) and arrest (β=0.13, CI95%, p=.022) was associated with increased engagement in sexual risk behaviors among female partners.  Conclusion:   Findings from this study identified differences in how criminal justice involvement impacts sexual and injection drug and sexual risk behaviors between male and female partners of PWID.

We designed our independent variable according to three categories: no mental illness (NMI), low or moderate (LMMI) and serious (SMI). We constructed regression models to estimate the odds ratios for those having a mental illness committing (a) a subtype of aggression over the past year compared with no aggression and (b) other-directed compared to self-directed aggression. We found that most respondents with mental illness reported no past-year aggression of any type. However, respondents with mental illness had higher odds of perpetrating all subtypes of aggression. Additionally, respondents with LMMI and SMI were respectively 1.7 and 3 times more likely to engage in self- rather than other-directed aggression. Future research should focus on identifying accurate and reliable predictors of self- and other-directed aggression among individuals with mental illness.""","""['Elias Ghossoub', 'Michele Cherro', 'Carla Akil', 'Yara Gharzeddine']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.

Despite pediatric obesity worsening, lipids improved. Given the relation between EW and abnormal lipids, changes in normal-weight (NW) youth may be relevant. We examined the proportions and temporal trends of youth with abnormal lipids who were NW versus EW.  Methods:   Analysis was done from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1988-2016. Data were extracted for 10- to 20-year-olds measured with anthropometrics and laboratory testing to determine proportions of NW versus EW with total cholesterol >190 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40 mg/dL, and calculated non-HDL-C >145 mg/dL (N = 14,785). In survey-weighted regression analysis, a weight-status interaction term was used to examine effect modification in the lipid temporal trend.  Results:   Over time, EW prevalence increased, whereas dyslipidemia decreased (trend P value < .001 for both). For the pooled sample, EW more than doubled the risk of each lipid disorder (P < .0001 for each). However, for each abnormal lipid, 26%-63% were NW. As the temporal trend in abnormal lipids declined, the proportion with abnormal lipids who were NW also declined. On regression analysis, temporal declines in NW and EW differed for HDL-C.  Conclusions:   NW constituted more than a quarter to half of youth with abnormal lipids. Over time, youth with abnormal lipids were less often NW. The novel observation that a high proportion of youth with abnormal lipids are NW is relevant to debates on universal lipid screening, the focus on weight reduction in youth lipid management, and conventional wisdom in cardiometabolic health.""","""['Justin P Zachariah', 'Teniola Shittu', 'Yunfei Wang']""","""["" Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.

Much of the focus of interventions is upon narcotics, stimulants, hallucinogens, central nervous system depressants, and alcohol. However, inhalants are also commonly used in an unhealthy manner and are under-recognized. The purpose of this study is to describe incident emergency department visits for volatile substance use to induce euphoria (VSUIE) injuries in the U.S. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) for the years 2015 to 2018. Descriptive frequencies, bivariate analyses using Rao-Scott Chi-Square, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to describe and examine the association between ED visits and VSUIE. Results: The estimated (weighted) number of VSUIE ED visits during 2015-2018 was 13,130 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 8,383-17876; Coefficient of variation, CV = 0.18) and accounted for 0.02% of all ED visits. Males were more likely than females (p < .0001), and young adults (ages ≥18 to ≤ 35 years) were more likely than older adults to have a VSUIE ED visit (p <.0001). Conclusion: VSUIE ED visits occur more commonly in young adults than older adults and adolescents. The widespread use of volatile substances to induce euphoria is an under-reported public health issue with life-threatening consequences. Use of volatile substances by adolescents is a particular concern which needs attention and interventions to prevent its initiation.""","""['R Constance Wiener', 'Christopher Waters', 'Ruchi Bhandari', 'Alcinda Shockey']""","""[' Department of Dental Practice and Rural Health, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' Department of Dental Research, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' Department of Epidemiology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' Department of Dental Hygiene, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021;56(""","""Subst Use Misuse""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'US Emergency Department Visits for Outpatient Adverse Drug Events, 2013-2014.', 'Substance abuse and mental health visits among adolescents presenting to US emergency departments.', 'US Emergency Department Visits Attributed to Medication Harms, 2017-2019.', 'Trends in Sports- and Recreation-Related Traumatic Brain Injuries Treated in US Emergency Departments: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) 2001-2012.']"""

A widely used measure of calibration when the outcome is survival time is the expected Brier score. In this paper, methodology is developed to accurately estimate the difference in expected Brier scores derived from nested survival models and to compute an accompanying variance estimate of this difference. The methodology is applicable to time invariant and time-varying coefficient Cox survival models. The nested survival model approach is often applied to the scenario where the full model consists of conventional and new covariates and the subset model contains the conventional covariates alone. A complicating factor in the methodologic development is that the Cox model specification cannot, in general, be simultaneously satisfied for nested models. The problem has been resolved by projecting the properly specified full survival model onto the lower dimensional space of conventional markers alone. Simulations are performed to examine the method's finite sample properties and a prostate cancer data set is used to illustrate its application.""","""['Glenn Heller']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering, 485 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017, USA. hellerg@mskcc.org.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Lifetime Data Anal""","""['Does the SORG Algorithm Predict 5-year Survival in Patients with Chondrosarcoma?

Methods: A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) randomized low-income first-time mothers to BFF or control app. BFF contained breastfeeding education and videos. The control app contained digital breastfeeding handouts. Outcomes included breastfeeding rates until 6 months postpartum and patient-reported best breastfeeding resource. After enrollment, nearly half the participants reported planning formula feeding after breastfeeding initiation, potentially confounding the RCT results. In this secondary analysis, women planning formula feeding were excluded. Outcomes between study groups were compared by intent-to-treat. Results: Of the original 170 participants, 41 in BFF and 46 in control group planned exclusively breastfeeding and were included. Exclusive breastfeeding rates were similar from 2 days postpartum (BFF: n = 19 [48.7%] versus control app: n = 21 [46.7%]; relative risk [RR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.67-1.63]) until 6 months postpartum. At 6 weeks postpartum, the majority of BFF users (n = 23 [62.2%]) believed an app provided the best breastfeeding support compared with 39% of control app users (n = 16; RR = 1.59 [95% CI = 1.01-2.52]). BFF users were 2.5 times more likely to deny having breastfeeding challenges compared with control app users (n = 12 [42.9%] versus n = 6 [16.7%]; RR = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.10-6.00]). Conclusion: BFF reduced self-reported breastfeeding challenges and was perceived as the best breastfeeding resource at home but did not increase breastfeeding rates among low-income first-time mothers desiring to exclusively breastfeed.

Malaria cases were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Two resurgences of malaria occurred during the 10 years in which LLINs have been in use. Since the third renewal of the nets, malaria decreased significantly compared with the first year the nets were implemented (adjusted incidence rate ratio) (95% CI) = 0.35 (0.15-0.85), during the ninth year after net implementation). During the tenth year of net implementation, no cases of malaria were observed among the study population.

Recent results from clinical trials have shown that DENV vaccination can induce the development of severe dengue disease and/or prolong hospitalization after natural infection in certain naive populations. Thus, it is crucial that vaccine development takes into account the history of DENV exposure in the targeted population. In Nepal, DENV infection was first documented in 2004, and despite the increasing prevalence of DENV infection, the population remains relatively naive. However, it is not known which of the four DENV serotypes circulate in Nepal or whether there is evidence of repeated exposure to DENV in the Nepali population. To address this, we studied 112 patients who presented with symptomology suspicious for DENV infection at clinics throughout Nepal during late 2015 and early 2016. Of the 112 patients examined, 39 showed serological and/or genetic evidence of primary or secondary DENV infection: 30 were positive for DENV exposure by IgM/IgG ELISA, two by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and seven by both methods. Dengue virus 1-3, but not DENV4, serotypes were detected by RT-PCR. Whole genome sequencing of two DENV2 strains isolated from patients with primary and secondary infections suggests that DENV was introduced into Nepal through India, with which it shares a porous border.

Design:   Longitudinal panel study.  Setting and participants:   The working sample had 4680 participants of 2006, 2010, and 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). All participants were at least 65 years old at baseline. Proxy responded cases and individuals who suffered from moderate to severe cognitive impairment were excluded from the analysis.  Methods:   Loneliness was measured with the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale. Five GCs were included: falls, incontinence, vision impairment, hearing impairment, and pain. Severity indicators were the number of times fallen in the past 2 years, number of days experiencing loss of bladder control in the past month, self-rated eyesight, self-rated hearing, and participants' perceived level of pain.  Results:   Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were run to analyze the relationship between the severity of each individual GC and loneliness. All models were controlled for baseline demographics, social isolation, self-rated health, physical function, comorbidities, and hospitalization. The longitudinal association between loneliness and fall was bidirectional: a higher loneliness score predicted an increased number of falls and vice versa. Incontinence, vision impairment, hearing impairment, and pain were not significantly associated with loneliness longitudinally. The association between the random intercept of loneliness and some GCs (vision and pain) were significant, indicating the severity of these GCs were related to loneliness at the between-person level at baseline.  Conclusion and implications:   Findings of the longitudinal analysis suggest a reciprocal relationship between fall and loneliness. Fall prevention programs could be integrated with social service for addressing loneliness, and alleviating loneliness might be beneficial for preventing falls.

Objective:   We investigated whether mixtures of paternal urinary bisphenol A (BPA), paraben, and phthalates were associated with pregnancy outcomes among couples attending a fertility center.  Methods:   We included 210 couples undergoing 300 in vitro fertilization (IVF) between 2004 and 2017 in this prospective analysis. We quantified paternal urinary biomarker concentrations in one sample per cycle using isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify correlations of biomarker concentrations and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models for discrete survival time to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between PCA-derived factor scores and probability of failing to achieve a live birth. Interactions were also included in the models to examine strength of associations over three vulnerable periods [embryo transfer to implantation, implantation to clinical pregnancy, and clinical pregnancy to live birth]. Models were adjusted for paternal and maternal ages and body mass indexes, urinary dilution (specific gravity) and year of collection, infertility diagnosis, and other PCA factor scores. Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for maternal PCA factor scores were performed.  Results:   We identified three factors, representing di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, BPA and non-DEHP metabolites, and parabens, accounting for 56%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of the total variance explained. An interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) increase in the DEHP-related factor score was associated with elevated probability of failing prior to live birth (HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.81) and the association was stronger between implantation and clinical pregnancy as well as between clinical pregnancy and live birth compared to before implantation. The overall HRs of failure for the BPA/non-DEHP-related and paraben-related factor scores were HR = 1.24 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.59) and HR = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.24).

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP) are established thyroid hormone disruptors, but their relationship to thyroid cancer is not known.  Methods:   We investigated the relationship between serum PCB and OCP concentrations and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in 250 incident female PTC cases and 250 female controls frequency-matched on age, all residing in Connecticut. Interviews and serum samples were collected from 2010 to 2013. Samples were analyzed for 32 different chemicals using gas chromatography with isotope dilution high resolution mass spectrometry. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using single pollutant logistic regression models for concentrations (per interquartile range) of individual PCB/OCP and summed groups of structurally or biologically similar PCB/OCP, adjusted for education, family history of cancer, alcohol consumption, age, and body mass index. Sub-analyses included stratification by tumor size (≤ and >1 cm) and birth before or during peak PCB production (born in 1960 or earlier and born after 1960), as exposures during early life may be important. We also applied three multi-pollutant approaches (standard multi-pollutant regression, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, principal components regression analysis) to investigate associations with co-exposures to multiple PCB/OCPs.  Results:   No PCB/OCPs were positively associated with PTC in primary analyses. Statistically significant associations were observed for 9 of the 32 chemicals and 3 summed groups of similar chemicals in the those born during peak production based on single-pollutant models. Multi-pollutant analyses suggested null associations overall.  Conclusions:   Our results using single and multi-pollutant modeling do not generally support an association between PCB or OCP exposure and PTC, but some associations in those born during peak production suggest that additional investigation into early-life exposures and subsequent thyroid cancer risk may be warranted.""","""['Nicole C Deziel', 'Joshua L Warren', 'Huang Huang', 'Haoran Zhou', 'Andreas Sjodin', 'Yawei Zhang']""","""[' Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.

Methods:   A prospective evaluation for patients with IC attending their scheduled follow-up was conducted between December 2013 and October 2015. The hernia stage was determined according to the European Hernia Society (EHS) classification as types I and II included defect size < 5 cm without and with a concomitant incisional hernia, respectively. Types III and IV included defect size > 5 cm without and with a concomitant incisional hernia (high-grade hernia). The evaluation was performed by a non-contrast CT scan. PROM were defined as symptomatic if there were hernia-related abdominal discomfort, appliance problems, and/or bowel complications. Perioperative parameters were modeled for prediction of high-grade and PROM outcomes.  Results:   PSH was diagnosed in 138 (39.9%) patients, symptomatic in 119 (34.4%) and high-grade in 59 (17%). Independent predictors of radiologically diagnosed PSH were hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7; 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.7; p = 0.02), localised disease (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9; p = 0.04) and negative lymphadenopathy (OR: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.2-0.8; p = 0.004).

Genetics may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH.  Aims:   To investigate the prevalence of NAFLD/NASH in 5,400 military personnel and evaluate the effect of treatment with 3 statins on NAFLD/NASH using 2 non-invasive scores [NAFLD Activity Score (NAS); Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4)].  Methods:   During the mandatory annual medical check-up, military personnel underwent a clinical and laboratory evaluation. Participants with NAFLD/NASH were randomized into 4 groups (n=151 each): diet-exercise, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin for 1 year (i.e., until the next routine evaluation).  Results:   From all the participants, 613 had NAFLD/NASH (prevalence 11.3 vs 39.8% in the general population, p<0.001), and a total of 604 consented to participate in the study. After a year of treatment, the diet-exercise group showed no significant changes in both scores (NAS 4.98 baseline vs. 5.62, p=0.07; FIB-4 3.42 vs. 3.52, p=0.7). For the atorvastatin group, both scores were reduced (NAS 4.97 vs 1.95, p<0.001, FIB-4 3.56 vs 0.83, p<0.001), for rosuvastatin (NAS 5.55 vs 1.81, p<0.001, FIB-4 3.61 vs 0.79, p<0.001), and for pitavastatin (NAS 4.89 vs 1.99, p<0.001, FIB-4 3.78 vs 0.87, p<0.001).  Conclusion:   Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin have a beneficial and safe effect in NAFLD/NASH patients as recorded by the improvement in the NAS (representing NAFLD activity) and FIB-4 (representing liver fibrosis) scores.

To potentially address this problem, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic foscarnet administered twice daily beginning on day +7 and continuing through engraftment in 25 patients. To determine the impact of foscarnet on HHV-6, engraftment, and other transplantation outcomes, we compared results in 61 identically treated patients with hematologic malignancies. Treatment and control groups underwent reduced-intensity conditioning UCB HCT with a conditioning regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation 200 cGy with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG), using sirolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil immune suppression. The treatment and control groups were similar in terms of age, disease risk, use of ATG, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index, and graft CD34 cell dose; however, foscarnet-treated patients were less likely to receive a double UCB graft and to be treated more recently (2016 to 2018). The cumulative incidence of HHV-6 reactivation by day +100 was 63% for all patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 51% to 75%) and was not significantly different between the 2 groups. HHV-6 reactivation occurred at a median of 34 days in the foscarnet group and 25.5 days in the control group. The incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42 was higher in the foscarnet group compared with the control group (96%; [95% CI, 83% to 100%] versus 75% [95% CI, 64% to 85%]; P< .01). The cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment by 6 months was 92% (95% CI, 69% to 100%) for the foscarnet group versus 75% (95% CI, 60% to 90%) for the control group (P= .08), and multivariate analysis identified the use of foscarnet as an independent predictor of better platelet engraftment. No patients died as a result of graft failure in recipients of foscarnet, whereas 5 patients died from graft failure in the control group. Six-month overall survival (OS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were better in the foscarnet group (96% versus 72% [P= .02] and 4% versus 18% [P= .07], respectively). Even though foscarnet prophylaxis did not prevent HHV-6 viremia, we observed a delay in time to HHV-6 reactivation, a trend toward differences in engraftment, NRM, and OS compared with historical controls.""","""['Najla El Jurdi', 'John Rogosheske', 'Todd DeFor', 'Nelli Bejanyan', 'Mukta Arora', 'Veronika Bachanova', 'Brian Betts', 'Fiona He', 'Shernan Holtan', 'Murali Janakiram', 'Samantha Larson', 'Joseph Maakaron', 'Armin Rashidi', 'Erica Warlick', 'John E Wagner', 'Jo-Anne H Young', 'Daniel Weisdorf', 'Claudio G Brunstein']""","""[' Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Participants were 319 adolescents and adults, ages 11 to 26 (M = 17), enrolled in Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study. At their first follow-up visit, participants completed a diagnostic interview and a 40-item Life Events Scale that reflected whether specific events occurred since their last post treatment assessment. Life events were categorized into domains (i.e., family, academic, health, and social) via researcher consensus. Participants reported having experienced an average of four NLEs. Participants with an anxiety disorder at follow-up were significantly more likely to have failed a grade in school (OR = 5.9) and experienced a negative change in acceptance by peers (OR = 4.9; ps < 0.001). After controlling for gender, age, race, and SES, a greater number of NLEs in the academic domain increased the odds of having an anxiety disorder at follow-up (OR = 2.4, p < 0.001).

The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between serum-PFAS concentrations measured in late pregnancy with relevant outcomes.  Methods:   The study sample included 433 pregnant women enrolled in the Vanguard Pilot Study of the National Children's Study. Six PFAS were measured in primarily third trimester serum, as well as fasting insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. The PFAS were examined in quartiles in relation to serum biomarkers, gestational age at birth and birth weight standardized for gestational age using multivariable-adjusted regression models.  Results:   Over 98% of the study population had detectable concentrations of four of the PFAS, and concentrations varied by race/ethnicity. Total cholesterol was positively associated with PFDA, PFNA, and PFOS, and triglycerides with PFDA, PFNA, PFOS, and PFOA, but PFAS were not associated with fasting insulin in adjusted models. Only PFNA was associated with an increased odds of birth at <37 weeks gestation. PFAS were generally not associated with birth weight, though PFHxS was associated with the first quartile of birth weight among males only.  Conclusions:   This study of pregnant U.S. women supports the ubiquitous exposure to PFAS and positive associations between PFAS exposure with serum-lipid concentrations. PFAS were largely unassociated with gestational age at birth and birth weight, though PFNA was associated with preterm birth.

Changes in social and physical environments associated with these transitions may influence development of health-related behaviours. Consumption of fast food is one behaviour associated with poor diet and long-term health outcomes. In this study we assess how frequency of fast food consumption changes across early adulthood, and how major life transitions are associated with changes in fast food intake.  Methods:   Data were collected across four waves of the Project EAT study, from mean age 14.9 (SD = 1.6) to mean age 31.1 (SD = 1.6) years. Participants reporting data at two or more waves were included (n = 2902). Participants reported past week frequency of eating food from a fast food restaurant and responded to questions on living arrangements, education and employment participation, and having children. To assess changes in fast food we developed a latent growth model incorporating an underlying trajectory of fast food intake, five life transitions, and time-invariant covariates.  Results:   Mean fast food intake followed an underlying quadratic trajectory, increasing through adolescence to a maximum of 1.88 (SE 0.94) times/week and then decreasing again through early adulthood to 0.76 (SE 2.06) times/week at wave 4. Beginning full-time employment and becoming a parent both contributed to increases in fast food intake, each resulting in an average increase in weekly fast food intake of 0.16 (p < 0.01) times/week. Analysis of changes between pairs of waves revealed stronger associations for these two transitions between waves 1-2 (mean age 14.9-19.4 years) than seen in later waves. Leaving the parental home and beginning cohabitation were associated with decreases in fast food intake of - 0.17 (p = 0.004) and - 0.16 (p = 0.007) times/week respectively, while leaving full-time education was not associated with any change.

Patients without previous history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack who had ≥ 50% stenosis in unilateral ICA on carotid color Doppler ultrasound were enrolled in the study. Patient demographics, vascular risk factors and ICA stenosis grades; number, location, and size of SBIs, DWMLs, and PWMLs in ICA territory were evaluated in both hemispheres using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Of the 69 patients, 53 had 50-69% (76.8%) and 16 had ≥ 70% (23.2%) unilateral ICA stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference in SBIs between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to ≥ 50% ICA stenosis. Comparison of ICA stenoses as 50-69% and ≥ 70% revealed a greater number of patients with SBI in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.025). The number of SBIs was also higher in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.022). While DWMLs and PWMLs did not differ between hemispheres, frequency of Fazekas grade 1 DWMLs was lower in ipsilateral hemisphere to either 50-69% or ≥ 70% ICA stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.035 and p = 0.025, respectively).

Methods:   The load of the OXA-48 β-lactamase gene in rectal swabs from 147 colonized patients was measured by quantitative PCR. The load was calculated relative to the total bacterial population (represented by the 16S rRNA gene) using the ΔΔCt method and pure cultures of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae as reference samples. The relative loads of the epidemic K. pneumoniae clones ST11 and ST405 were also measured.  Results:   The relative intestinal loads of the OXA-48 β-lactamase gene, RLOXA-48, in hospitalized patients were high. The median RLOXA-48 was -0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.60 to -0.16), close to that of a pure culture of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae (RLOXA-48 = 0). In those patients colonized by the KpOXA clones ST11 (51/147, 34.7%) and ST405 (14/147, 9.5%), the relative loads of these clones were similarly high (median RLST11 = -1.1, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.92; median RLST405 = -1.3, 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.96). Patients that had received previous antibiotic treatments and those that developed infections by KpOXA had significantly higher RLOXA-48 values: -0.32 (95% CI: -0.58 to -0.20) vs -1.07 (95% CI: -2.43 to -0.35) and -0.26 (-0.77 to -0.23) vs -0.47 (-0.74 to -0.28), respectively.  Conclusions:   Colonization by KpOXA in hospital patients involves intestinal loads much higher than the K. pneumoniae loads reported in the normal microbiota, reaching levels close to those of pure KpOXA cultures in many cases and largely replacing the host microbiota.""","""['Fernando Lázaro-Perona', 'María Rodríguez-Tejedor', 'Guillermo Ruiz-Carrascoso', 'Beatriz Díaz-Pollán', 'Belén Loeches', 'Juan Carlos Ramos-Ramos', 'Jesús Mingorance']""","""[' Servicio de Microbiología, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain.', ' Unidad de Microbiología Clínica y Enfermedades Infecciosas, Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', ' Servicio de Microbiología, Hospital Universitario La Paz, IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain.

Guidelines to combine such repeated biospecimens do not exist.  Aims:   To compare the efficiency of several designs relying on repeated biospecimens to estimate exposure over 7 days.  Methods:   We quantified triclosan and bisphenol A (BPA) in all urine voids (N = 427) collected over seven days from eight individuals. We estimated the volume-weighted concentrations for all urine samples collected during a week and compared these gold standards with the concentrations obtained for equal-volume pools (standardized or not for urine dilution), unequal-volume pools (based on sample volume or creatinine concentration), and for the mean of the creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each spot sample.  Results:   For both chemicals, correlations with gold standards were similar for equal- and unequal-volume pooling designs. Only for BPA, correlation coefficients were markedly lower after standardization for specific gravity or creatinine of concentrations estimated in equal-volume pools. Averaging BPA creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each spot sample led also to lower correlations with gold standards compared to those obtained for unstandardized pooling designs.  Conclusion:   For BPA and triclosan, considering individual urine sample volume or creatinine concentrations when pooling is unnecessary because equal-volume pool adequately estimates concentrations in gold standards. Standardization for specific gravity or creatinine of the concentrations assessed in equal-volume pool as well as averaging creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each individual spot sample are not suitable for BPA.

Isolates showing azole resistance according to the EUCAST 9.3.2 methodology were molecularly identified and the cyp51A gene was studied in A. fumigatus sensu stricto isolates.  Results:   Eight hundred and forty-seven isolates from 725 patients were collected in 29 hospitals (A. fumigatus sensu stricto (n = 828) and cryptic species (n = 19)). Isolates were mostly from the lower respiratory tract (94.0%; 797/847). Only cryptic species were amphotericin B resistant. Sixty-three (7.4%) out of the 847 isolates were resistant to ≥1 azole(s). Azole resistance was higher in cryptic species than in A. fumigatus sensu stricto (95%, 18/19 vs. 5.5%, 45/828); isavuconazole was associated to the lowest number of non-wild type isolates. The dominant mechanism of resistance was the presence of TR34-L98H substitutions (n = 24 out of 63). Out of the 725 patients, 48 (6.6%) carried either cryptic species (n = 14) or A. fumigatus sensu stricto (n = 34; 4.7%) resistant isolates.

Of note, clonal expansion of macrolide-resistant ST3 occurred in Japan and South Korea. An alarming surge in macrolide resistance complicates the treatment of pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the clinical manifestation and clonal relatedness of M. pneumoniae circulating among children in Taiwan.  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled 626 children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia between 2017 and 2019. An M. pneumoniae infection was suspected on clinical grounds, and tested by real-time PCR and oropharyngeal swab cultures. We used multilocus sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing to characterize the genetic features of M. pneumoniae.  Results:   A total of 226 children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Macrolide resistance was found in 77% (174/226) of patients. Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that ST3 (n = 93) and its single-locus variant ST17 (n = 84) were the predominant clones among macrolide-resistant strains. ST17 presented clinical characteristics comparable to its ancestor ST3. On multivariate analysis, macrolide resistance (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4-8.5; p 0.007) was independently associated with fever >72 hours after macrolide treatment. By whole-genome sequencing, prediction analysis of recombination sites revealed one recombination site in ST3 and ST17 compared with M29 (a macrolide-sensitive ST3 strain isolated from China in 2005) containing cytadhesin MgpC-like protein, RepMP4 and RepMP5. ST17 had another recombination site containing an adhesin and RepMP2/3.

Few prevention trials have engaged whole families of school-age children in community settings, and none to date have promoted family meals, family activity and healthful home environments in rural settings through a rigorous, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The New Ulm at HOME (NU-HOME) study recruited 114 parent/child dyads in a two-arm (intervention versus wait-list control) RCT to test the efficacy of a family meals-focused program aimed to prevent excess weight gain among 7-10 year-old children in rural Minnesota. The NU-HOME program was adapted from a previously tested program for urban families through a unique community collaboration. The program included 7 monthly in-person sessions for all family members. Parents also participated in 4 motivational goal-setting phone calls. The primary outcome measures were age- and sex-adjusted child body mass index (BMI) z-score, percent body fat, and incidence of overweight and obesity post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included quality of food and beverage availability in the home; family meals and snacks; children's dietary intake quality (e.g., Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015, fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, snacks); and children's screen time and weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total physical activity, and sedentary behavior. The NU-HOME RCT was a collaborative effort of academic and health system researchers, interventionists and community leaders that aimed to prevent childhood obesity in rural communities through engagement of the whole family in an interactive intervention.""","""['Jayne A Fulkerson', 'Melissa L Horning', 'Daheia J Barr-Anderson', 'Jennifer A Linde', 'Abbey C Sidebottom', 'Rebecca Lindberg', 'Sarah Friend', 'Colleen Flattum', 'Rebecca L Freese']""","""[' School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, 5-140 Weaver-Densford Hall, 308 Harvard Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

People with substance use disorders also experience addiction-related problems across domains of life functioning. However, few studies have evaluated the relationship between elevated AS and addiction-related problems across specific life areas. We evaluated, first, whether AS predicted addiction-related problems in a sample of treatment-refractory outpatients with opioid use disorders and, second, whether sex moderated the relationship between AS and addiction-related problems in this sample. Participants with treatment-refractory opioid use disorders (n = 92, 53.3% male) completed baseline assessments of AS (the Anxiety Sensitivity Index) and addiction-related problems (the Addiction Severity Index). Baseline AS total score was a significant independent predictor of both baseline Addiction Severity Index medical status (β = 0.29, t = 2.84, p = .006) and psychiatric status (β = 0.30, t = 2.99, p = .004) composite scores but was not associated with social, employment or legal difficulties. These findings were maintained when controlling for drug use severity, though baseline AS total score became a significant predictor of baseline legal difficulties (β = -0.23, t = -2.25, p = .027). There was no moderating role of sex on the relationship between baseline AS and addiction-related problems. Our findings suggest that, regardless of sex, elevated AS predicts increased addiction-related medical and psychiatric problems, and decreased legal problems when accounting for drug use severity, in outpatients with opioid use disorders.""","""['Georgia Stathopoulou', 'Alexandra K Gold', 'Danielle L Hoyt', 'Megan Milligan', 'Bridget A Hearon', 'Michael W Otto']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Medical School, 25 Shattuck Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Both the canonical MET and L1-MET transcripts are considered to play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of canonical MET, L1-MET, and MET protein expressions as predictive biomarkers for chemo-sensitivity to MET-inhibitors in HCC cell lines in vitro. Additionally, we assessed their expression in tumour tissues from Egyptian HCC patients.  Methods:   MET and L1-MET expressions were assessed by qRT-PCR in six liver cancer cell lines (SNU-387, SNU-475, SK-HEP-1, PLC/PRF/5, SNU-449 and SNU-423) and 47 HCC tumour tissues. MET protein expression was measured by western blot in cell lines and immunohistochemistry in the tumours. Cell proliferation assay was used to assess the effect of crizotinib and tivantinib on the six liver cancer cell lines in correlation with the expression of MET, L1-MET and MET.  Results:   The antitumor effect of crizotinib and tivantinib correlated with MET gene expression but not with L1-MET transcript or MET protein expressions. No significant difference was observed between HCC tumours and non-tumour samples in MET and L1-MET transcripts expression. There were no significant correlations between the 2-year overall survival rate and the MET, L1-MET transcripts and the MET protein expression.  Conclusion:   MET RNA expression could be useful biomarker for tivantinib and crizotinib targeted therapy in HCC. The value of assessment of MET protein expression is limited.""","""['Wafaa M Rashed', 'Mohamed A Kandeil', 'Mohamed O Mahmoud', 'Doha Maher', 'Sameera Ezzat', 'Mohamed H Abdel-Rahman']""","""["" Department of Research, Children's Cancer Hospital, Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ' Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Beni-Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt.', ' Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Beni-Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt.', ' Department of Pathology, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Egypt.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Prevention Medicine, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Egypt.', ' Department of Pathology, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Egypt.

Many sociodemographic factors have been evaluated with regard to HPV vaccine uptake but there has been less focus on the role of religion and religiosity. Our qualitative case study aimed to identify community perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccination via seven focus group discussions (FGDs) with leaders and members of an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church in metro-Atlanta, Georgia from April 2018 to July 2018. A Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) conceptual framework was used to identify potential avenues to strengthen communication and health promotion strategies in the church community. Results showed diverse perceptions about HPV vaccine amongst the church community, ranging from viewing the HPV vaccine as essential to unnecessary for adolescents. Two key barriers to the HPV vaccine that may be addressed through the SBCC strategies were identified: 1) general mistrust in the healthcare system and 2) the expectation of abstinence among adolescents. For future HPV prevention opportunities, congregants highlighted they would be more receptive to receiving HPV vaccine promotion messages from pre-established trustworthy sources. Church leaders hold the trust of their congregation, therefore implementation of a church-based intervention utilizing the SBCC strategies has considerable potential to transform perceptions of the HPV vaccine and increase vaccination uptake. These findings may be implemented in future HPV vaccine promotion strategies within faith-based communities to promote safe and open dialogue for health communication messages to be disseminated in a familiar and trusted setting.""","""['Ariana Y Lahijani', 'Adrian R King', 'Mary M Gullatte', 'Monique Hennink', 'Robert A Bednarczyk']""","""[' Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', ' Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University, 1520 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Emory Healthcare, 235 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.', ' Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, 954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.

Further, research has shown that adolescents and adults with a history of childhood maltreatment are more likely to develop depression and anxiety after being exposed to stress than those without this history. However, the processes underlying risk for depression and anxiety in maltreated preadolescent children are unclear. The current study sought to identify these processes in at-risk preadolescents.  Methods:   This study analyzed data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect and evaluated interpersonal and non-interpersonal life stress as predictors of depression and anxiety specifically, and internalizing symptoms more generally, in a sample of children vulnerable or exposed to maltreatment (n = 1,049). Participants were assessed repeatedly over a six-year period of early-to-mid childhood.  Results:   Interpersonal life stress prospectively predicted greater depression and anxiety, but not general internalizing symptoms after emotional and behavioral problems, as well as child's sex, family income and baseline maternal depressive symptoms, were covaried. Non-interpersonal life stress was not prospectively predictive of depression and anxiety or general internalizing symptoms.  Limitations:   The study was unable to identify specific types of interpersonal stress most relevant to risk for depression and anxiety in preadolescent children.  Conclusions:   These findings lend support for the importance of interpersonal stress when screening for risk for depression and anxiety among preadolescent children vulnerable or exposed to maltreatment. Early intervention to decrease the occurrence and impact of these stressors could have long-lasting impacts on this vulnerable population.""","""['Rachel Y Levin', 'Richard T Liu']""","""[' Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114; Harvard Medical School.', ' Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114; Harvard Medical School.

Although substantial data exist on adolescent substance use, studies examining the role of parental psychopathological profiles on adolescent offspring SUD are lacking. Thus, this study aimed to identify parental psychopathological profiles, and to examine the extent to which these profiles are associated with SUD in their offspring.  Method:   Our analytic sample comprised 5887 adolescents (48.60% boys; M = 15.07 years, SD = 1.46) from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), whose biological parents responded to the Parent Self-Administered Questionnaire. Parental psychopathological profiles were identified by means of latent class analysis.  Results:   Different psychopathological profiles were identified in fathers and mothers. Among fathers, two psychopathological profiles were found: ""normative class"" (low psychopathological symptoms and drug use) and ""high psychopathology class"" (high psychopathological symptoms and drug use). Among mothers, three psychopathological profiles were found: ""normative class"" (low psychopathological symptoms and drug use), ""high psychopathology class"" (high psychopathological symptoms and drug use), and ""suicide class"" (low psychopathological symptoms and drug use, but high on suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt). Father's high psychopathology profile was significantly associated with adolescent's illicit drug abuse. Mother's high psychopathology profile was significantly associated with adolescent's nicotine dependence, alcohol or illicit drug abuse.

We assessed the frequency of and risk factors for reversion of QFTs in HCWs in an intermediate-tuberculosis burden country.  Methods:   We enrolled high-risk HCWs at a tertiary-care hospital in South Korea, who were assessed by QFTs at least twice between 2017 and 2019.  Results:   Of the 1870 HCWs screened, 1542 (82%) had persistent negative results, 229 (12%) had persistent positive results, 53 (3%) showed reversion, and 46 (2%) showed conversion from negative to positive. Multivariate analysis comparing the characteristics of the 229 HCWs with persistent positive results and the 53 who experienced reversion showed that older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-0.99), male sex (aOR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and high (≥0.70 IU/mL) baseline QFT results (aOR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.07-0.31) were inversely associated with reversion. Using an ROC curve-derived cut-off of <0.738 IU/mL, the area under the curve was 0.79.

Purpose:   In a subset of children, adolescents, and young adults recruited from a larger trial investigating arteriopathy and stroke risk after RT, we evaluated the prevalence of CMBs after RT, examined risk factors for CMBs and cognitive impairment, and related their longitudinal development to cognitive performance changes.  Methods:   Twenty-five patients (mean 17 years, range: 10-25 years) underwent 7-Tesla MRI and cognitive assessment. Nineteen patients were treated with whole-brain or focal RT 1-month to 20-years prior, while 6 non-irradiated patients with posterior-fossa tumors served as controls. CMBs were detected on 7T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) using semi-automated software, a first use in this population.  Results:   CMB detection sensitivity with 7T SWI was higher than previously reported at lower field strengths, with one or more CMBs detected in 100% of patients treated with RT at least 1-year prior. CMBs were localized to dose-targeted brain volumes with risk factors including whole-brain RT (p = 0.05), a higher RT dose (p = 0.01), increasing time since RT (p = 0.03), and younger age during RT (p = 0.01). Apart from RT dose, these factors were associated with impaired memory performance. Follow-up data in a subset of patients revealed a proportional increase in CMB count with worsening verbal memory performance (r = -0.85, p = 0.03).

Toll-like receptor gene (TLR)-3 is an innate detector of dsRNA viruses, and the TLR-9 gene recognizes bacterial and viral unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs. We previously reported that the TLR-3.rs3775290 CC genotype was associated with HCV chronicity and that the TLR-9 gene played no major role in this infection. This study identified the role of TLR-3.rs3775290 (c.1377C/T), TLR-9.rs5743836 (-1237T→C) and TLR-9.rs352140 (G2848A) gene polymorphisms in predicting the outcome of HCV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) among Egyptian health-care workers (HCWs). We enrolled 265 HCWs in this study and divided them into four groups. Group 1: 140 seronegative-aviraemic HCWs; group 2: 20 seronegative-viraemic HCWs; group 3: 35 subjects with spontaneously resolved HCV infection; and group 4: 70 chronic HCV HCWs (patients).

We also quantified HCV-specific CMI in the four groups using an interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay in response to nine HCV genotype 4a, overlapping 15mer peptide pools covering the whole viral genome. No statistically significant difference was found between CMI-responding subjects with different HCV states and TLR-3.rs3775290 or TLR-9.rs352140 genotypes. However, there was a significant relationship between the outcome of the HCV-specific CMI and the TLR-9.rs5743836 genotype among the responding subjects (P = 0·005) and the chronic HCV patients (P = 0·044).

However, the impact of glycaemic derangement on sleep pattern among children with type 1 diabetes (C-T1D) remains unraveled.  Aim:   To assess the effect of nocturnal hyperglycaemia and clinically significant (CS) hypoglycaemia on sleep pattern among C-T1D.  Methodology:   Thirty C-T1D were compared to 30 age and sex matched healthy siblings. Patients having other organ disease that might cause sleep disorders or on medications causing sleep disturbance were excluded. History included diabetes-duration, type and dose of insulin therapy, chronic diabetic-complications, and manifestations of sleep disorders. Epworth Sleepiness Scale-Child Adolescent was used. Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and overnight polysomnography were done and analysed.  Results:   C-T1D had significantly lower sleep efficiency and significantly higher arousal index (AI), periodic limb movement index and apnoea-hypopnoea index compared to controls. Moreover, they had significantly longer sleep-onset latency, light sleep percentage, and shorter rapid eye movement percentage than controls. According to nocturnal CGMS readings, 15 C-T1D had nocturnal hyperglycaemia (50%), six experienced CS hypoglycaemia (20%), two had level-1 hypoglycaemia (6.7%), and seven were within the normoglycaemic range (23.3%). C-T1D experiencing nocturnal CS hypoglycaemia had significantly higher stage 3 sleep (P = 0.004) than controls.

The 401 students who selected a parent drank less and less often than those who did not select a parent as a frequent contact.

Adherence and rate of nicotine metabolism may be associated with quit rates in such clinical trials.  Methods:   This secondary analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline for smoking among PLWHA (N = 179) examined the relationship between varenicline adherence (pill count, ≥80% of pills), nicotine metabolism (based on the nicotine metabolite ratio; NMR) and end-of-treatment smoking cessation (self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence, confirmed with carbon monoxide of ≤ 8 ppm, at the end of treatment; EOT).  Results:   Combining varenicline and placebo arms, greater adherence (OR = 1.011, 95% CI:1.00-1.02, p = 0.051) and faster nicotine metabolism (OR = 3.08, 95% CI:1.01-9.37, p = 0.047) were related to higher quit rates. In separate models, adherence (OR = 1.009, 95% CI:1.004-1.01, p < 0.001) and nicotine metabolism rate (OR = 2.04, 95% CI:1.19-3.49, p = 0.009) interacted with treatment arm to effect quit rates.

Likewise, among slow metabolizers (NMR < 0.31), the varenicline quit rate was not significantly higher vs. placebo (14% vs. 5%; χ2[1] = 1.17, p = 0.28) but, among fast metabolizers (NMR ≥ 0.31), the quit rate for varenicline was significantly higher vs. placebo (33% vs. 14%; χ2[1] = 4.43, p = 0.04).

Green tea is a frequent component in implicated products, but its role in liver injury is controversial. The aim of this study was to better characterize the clinical features, outcomes, and pathogenesis of green tea-associated liver injury.  Approach and results:   Among 1,414 patients enrolled in the U.S. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network who underwent formal causality assessment, 40 cases (3%) were attributed to green tea, 202 to dietary supplements without green tea, and 1,142 to conventional drugs. The clinical features of green tea cases and representation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II alleles in cases and control were analyzed in detail. Patients with green tea-associated liver injury ranged in age from 17 to 69 years (median = 40) and developed symptoms 15-448 days (median = 72) after starting the implicated agent. The liver injury was typically hepatocellular (95%) with marked serum aminotransferase elevations and only modest increases in alkaline phosphatase. Most patients were jaundiced (83%) and symptomatic (88%). The course was judged as severe in 14 patients (35%), necessitating liver transplantation in 3 (8%), but rarely resulting in chronic injury (3%). In three instances, injury recurred upon re-exposure to green tea with similar clinical features, but shorter time to onset. HLA typing revealed a high prevalence of HLA-B*35:01, found in 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58-87) of green tea cases, but only 15% (95% CI, 10-20) caused by other supplements and 12% (95% CI, 10-14) attributed to drugs, the latter rate being similar to population controls (11%; 95% CI, 10.5-11.5).

A total of 50 patients with keloids were included in the study, 22 patients (with 26 keloids) were treated with IL BTX-A monthly for up to 6 months and other 22 patients (with 27 keloids) were treated with IL 5-FU weekly for up to 6 weeks, while the remaining 6 patients, each having multiple keloids, were treated with both IL BTX-A for some lesions (8 keloids) and IL 5-FU for their remaining lesions (8 keloids). The clinical improvement was assessed according to flattening of the lesions. Side effects were recorded. A significantly better therapeutic response of keloids was detected after IL BTX-A than IL 5-FU (P = 0.041). IL BTX-A achieved excellent and good flattening of the lesions (58.8% and 20.6%) compared to (31.4% and 17.1%) after IL 5-FU, respectively.

Results:   Of 4304 combat casualties, 341 (7.9%) underwent laparotomy. Including re-explorations, 1053 laparotomies (median, 2; interquartile range, 1-3; range, 1-28) were performed with 58% occurring within the combat zone. Forty-nine (14.4%) patients had abdominal SSIs (four with multiple SSIs): 27 (7.9%) with deep space SSIs, 14 (4.1%) with a deep incisional SSI, and 12 (3.5%) a superficial incisional SSI. Patients with abdominal SSIs had larger volume of blood transfusions (median, 24 versus 14 units), more laparotomies (median, 4 versus 2), and more hollow viscus injuries (74% versus 45%) than patients without abdominal SSIs. Abdominal closure occurred after 10 d for 12% of the patients with SSI versus 2% of patients without SSI.

People with substance use disorders are at a heightened risk for the misuse of benzodiazepines, yet little is known about sex differences in the prevalence, correlates or patterns of benzodiazepine misuse in this population. The aim of this study was to characterize sex differences in benzodiazepine misuse in a sample of adults receiving substance use disorder treatment (N = 352). Almost half of the sample had been prescribed a benzodiazepine and more than 40% had misused a benzodiazepine. Women were more likely to have a lifetime prescription than men, but were not more likely to report misuse or regular misuse. Consistent with data for other substances, women were more likely to report misusing benzodiazepines to cope and reported greater anxiety sensitivity. The vast majority (97%) of participants reported co-use of benzodiazepines with other substances and 65% of women reporting misusing benzodiazepines via a non-oral route of administration (e.g., intranasal). Although benzodiazepine misuse prevalence was not substantively different between men and women, several sex differences in clinical characteristics and patterns of use were identified. Further research on the nature of sex differences in benzodiazepine misuse is needed to inform targeted treatment for both men and women with substance use disorders.""","""['R Kathryn McHugh', 'Rachel B Geyer', 'Alexandra R Chase', 'Margaret L Griffin', 'Olivera Bogunovic', 'Roger D Weiss']""","""[' Division of Alcohol, Drugs, and Addiction, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA 02478, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Altered hippocampal, and specifically dentate gyrus (DG), structure and function may be involved in depression development. However, hippocampal abnormalities could also be a consequence of the disease. For the first time, we tested whether abnormal DG micro- and macrostructure were present in offspring of individuals with MDD and whether these abnormalities predicted future symptomatology.  Methods:   We measured the mean diffusivity of gray matter, a measure of microstructure, via diffusion tensor imaging and volume of the DG via structural magnetic resonance imaging in 102 generation 2 and generation 3 offspring at high and low risk for depression, defined by the presence or absence, respectively, of moderate to severe MDD in generation 1. Prior, current, and future depressive symptoms were tested for association with hippocampal structure.  Results:   DG mean diffusivity was higher in individuals at high risk for depression, regardless of a lifetime history of MDD. While DG mean diffusivity was not associated with past or current depressive symptoms, higher mean diffusivity predicted higher symptom scores 8 years later. DG microstructure partially mediated the association between risk and future symptoms. DG volume was smaller in high-risk generation 2 but not in high-risk generation 3.  Conclusions:   Together, these findings suggest that the DG has a role in the development of depression. Furthermore, DG microstructure, more than macrostructure, is a sensitive risk marker for depression and partially mediates future depressive symptoms.""","""['Milenna T van Dijk', 'Jiook Cha', 'David Semanek', 'Natalie Aw', 'Marc J Gameroff', 'Eyal Abraham', 'Priya J Wickramaratne', 'Myrna M Weissman', 'Jonathan Posner', 'Ardesheer Talati']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Division of Translational Epidemiology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.', ' Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Department of Psychology, Seoul National University, South Korea.', ' Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Division of Child Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.', ' Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York; Division of Translational Epidemiology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.', ' Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York; Division of Translational Epidemiology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.

One potential explanation for this disparity in binge eating is minority stress theory, which posits that minority groups face stressors, such as discrimination, due to their stigmatized position in society. Additionally, specific domains of discrimination may confer different levels of risk for binge eating. Therefore, the current study examined the association of various forms of discrimination, including appearance-based discrimination, and binge eating in a sample of SMM. A sample of 200 SMM (analytic sample of N = 187) from the greater Boston area completed self-report questionnaires assessing frequency of different forms of perceived discrimination (appearance, sexual orientation, race, etc.) and binge eating. A hierarchical binary logistic regression model was used to examine the association of different forms of discrimination with binge eating. 9% of the sample reported binge eating. Appearance-based discrimination was the most common form of discrimination (47%), and was significantly associated with binge eating, over and above all other forms of discrimination and sociodemographic variables, OR = 1.71, 95% CI = [1.24, 2.35], Wald χ2 (1) = 10.65, p = .001.

However,the roles of GWAS-susceptibility loci in stroke prognosis are just beginning. The present study aimed to examine whether these GWAS-linked loci polymorphisms are associated with ischemic stroke recurrence in a Chinese population.  Methods:   We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (9p21: rs2383207 and rs4977574; 12p13: rs12425791 and rs11833579; PDE4D: rs966221; and ALOX5AP: rs1050391) in four GWAS-reported ischemic stroke risk genes in 657 patients.  Results:   The risk of recurrent stroke was significantly associated with PDE4D rs966221 in the dominant model (p = 0.027)and recessive model (p = 0.027). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated no significant difference in the rate of recurrent stroke among the three genotypes of other five SNPs. Cox regression analysis showed that the GA + GG genotype within the rs966221 polymorphism had a 1.399-fold risk for stoke recurrence (95% confidence interval = 1.038-1.886; p = 0.027). Stratified analysis revealed that the increased recurrence risk of PDE4D rs966221 was more prominent in the large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) subgroup.

Objectives:   To examine the (1) variation in technical skill scores of practicing surgeons, (2) association between technical skills and patient outcomes, and (3) amount of variation in patient outcomes explained by a surgeon's technical skill.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this quality improvement study, 17 practicing surgeons submitted a video of a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy that was then rated by at least 10 blinded peer surgeons and 2 expert raters. The association between surgeon technical skill scores and risk-adjusted outcomes was examined using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The association between technical skill scores and outcomes was examined for colorectal procedures and noncolorectal procedures (ie, assessed on whether technical skills demonstrated during colectomy were associated with patient outcomes across other cases). In addition, the proportion of patient outcomes explained by technical skill scores was examined using robust regression techniques. The study was conducted from September 23, 2016, to February 10, 2018; data analysis was performed from November 2018 to January 2019.  Exposures:   Colorectal and noncolorectal procedures.  Main outcomes and measures:   Any complication, mortality, unplanned hospital readmission, unplanned reoperation related to principal procedure, surgical site infection, and death or serious morbidity.  Results:   Of the 17 surgeons included in the study, 13 were men (76%). The participants had a range from 1 to 28 years in surgical practice (median, 11 years). Based on 10 or more reviewers per video and with a maximum quality score of 5, overall technical skill scores ranged from 2.8 to 4.6. From 2014 to 2016, study participants performed a total of 3063 procedures (1120 colectomies). Higher technical skill scores were significantly associated with lower rates of any complication (15.5% vs 20.6%, P = .03; Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient r = -0.54, P = .03), unplanned reoperation (4.7% vs 7.2%, P = .02; r = -0.60, P = .01), and a composite measure of death or serious morbidity (15.9% vs 21.4%, P = .02; r = -0.60, P = .01) following colectomy. Similar associations were found between colectomy technical skill scores and patient outcomes for all types of procedures performed by a surgeon. Overall, technical skill scores appeared to account for 25.8% of the variation in postcolectomy complication rates and 27.5% of the variation when including noncolectomy complication rates.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this study suggest that there is wide variation in technical skill among practicing surgeons, accounting for more than 25% of the variation in patient outcomes. Higher colectomy technical skill scores appear to be associated with lower complication rates for colectomy and for all other procedures performed by a surgeon.

However, as genetic variants may have effects on more than one gene and through different mechanisms, these methods likely only capture part of the total effects of these variants. In this paper, we propose a summary statistics-based mixed effects score test (sMiST) that tests for the total effect of both the effect of the mediator by imputing genetically predicted gene expression, like S-PrediXcan and TWAS, and the direct effects of individual variants. It allows for multiple functional annotations and multiple genetically predicted mediators. It can also perform conditional association analysis while adjusting for other genetic variants (e.g., known loci for the phenotype). Extensive simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that sMiST yields p-values that agree well with those obtained from individual level data but with substantively improved computational speed. Importantly, a broad application of sMiST to GWAS is possible, as only summary statistics of genetic variant associations are required. We apply sMiST to a large-scale GWAS of colorectal cancer using summary statistics from ∼120, 000 study participants and gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identify several novel and secondary independent genetic loci.""","""['Xinyuan Dong', 'Yu-Ru Su', 'Richard Barfield', 'Stephanie A Bien', 'Qianchuan He', 'Tabitha A Harrison', 'Jeroen R Huyghe', 'Temitope O Keku', 'Noralane M Lindor', 'Clemens Schafmayer', 'Andrew T Chan', 'Stephen B Gruber', 'Mark A Jenkins', 'Charles Kooperberg', 'Ulrike Peters', 'Li Hsu']""","""[' Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ' Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', ' Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', ' Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.', ' Department of General Surgery, University Hospital Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', "" Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ' City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, and Department of Preventive Medicine & USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', ' Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']""","""2020""","""2020 Aug""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Genetic Regulation of DNA Methylation Yields Novel Discoveries in GWAS of Colorectal Cancer.', 'How powerful are summary-based methods for identifying expression-trait associations under different genetic architectures?', 'Statistical power of transcriptome-wide association studies.', 'A Mixed-Effects Model for Powerful Association Tests in Integrative Functional Genomics.', 'Influence of tissue context on gene prioritization for predicted transcriptome-wide association studies.', 'Deciphering colorectal cancer genetics through multi-omic analysis of 100,204 cases and 154,587 controls of European and east Asian ancestries.', 'An empirical Bayes approach to improving population-specific genetic association estimation by leveraging cross-population data.', 'Genetic Regulation of DNA Methylation Yields Novel Discoveries in GWAS of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Oral vitamin D supplementation induces transcriptomic changes in rectal mucosa that are linked to anti-tumour effects.']"""

Objective:   To identify cross-reactivity patterns and predictors of skin test positive (STP) in geographically disparate patients with a CAL.  Methods:   A total of 780 adult patients labeled with a CAL or penicillin allergy label (PAL) with unknown tolerance of cephalosporins identified from the Austin Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) (n = 410) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN) (n = 370) between 2014 and 2018 underwent a standardized skin testing.  Results:   Of 328 patients with a CAL, 29 (8.8%) tested STP to ≥1 cephalosporin(s). There were no cefazolin or ceftriaxone STP, 0 of 452 (0%), in patients with a PAL only. Of 328 patients with a CAL, 16 (4.8%) were ampicillin STP. Eleven of 16 of these patients had an initial allergy label to cephalexin. Twenty of 29 cephalosporin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to a cephalosporin with a different R1 side chain, and 8 of 14 ampicillin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to ≥1 non-amino R1 group cephalosporin. Eleven of 13 patients STP to cefazolin were skin and ingestion challenge negative to all other penicillins and cephalosporins predicted by its distinct R1/R2 groups. Seven of 15 ceftriaxone STP patients demonstrated cross-reactivity with R1-similar cephalosporins. Time since the original reaction predicted STP testing to both penicillins, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per year 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.97), and cephalosporins, aOR per year 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.90).  Conclusions:   Cephalosporin cross-reactivity is based on shared R1 groupings.

We investigated the relationship of past-year medical and non-medical use of z-drugs with past-year: i) psychological distress; ii) medical use, non-medical use, and DSM-IV use disorder of Benzodiazepine (BZD) tranquilizers; iii) use and DSM-IV alcohol and marijuana use disorders, recreational drugs with a depressant effect on the central nervous system.  Methods:   Data came from the 2015-2017 NSDUH (n = 128,740). Participants aged 18+ were asked if they had used any Z-Drug medically or non-medically in the past year. We investigated the associations between the three-level z-drugs variable with psychological distress and BZD, alcohol, and marijuana variables in multinomial logistic regression models.  Results:   Past-year prevalences of z-drug use were 3.3% for medical and 0.5% for non-medical use. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of psychological distress, compared to non-users. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of medical use, non-medical use, and BZD use disorders. Compared to non-users of z-drugs, medical users had higher risk of marijuana and alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, while non-medical users had higher risk of marijuana use and marijuana use disorders and alcohol.

Thus, owing to features of the built city environment, specific locations where physical activity take place may put individuals at increased risk for harmful inhaled exposures leading to decrements in lung function.Objectives: The objectives were to determine locations throughout an urban landscape where children engage in moderate to vigorous activity (MVA). We hypothesized that outdoor activity would be associated with increased exposure to air pollution and reduced lung function.Methods: Children aged 9-14 years living in New York City (NYC) (n = 151) wore global positioning system devices and wrist accelerometers for two 24-hour periods. Time-stamped global positioning system points and accelerometer data were aggregated and mapped using ArcGIS to determine locations where children engaged in MVA. Location-specific particulate matter <2.5 microns and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was determined based on land use regression models of street-level pollution. Temporal air pollution exposure was determined based on daily concentrations collected at one central site in NYC. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF25-75) were collected following each 24-hour period. Data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models to examine associations between MVA time and both lung function and air pollution in separate models. Additionally, a multiplicative interaction term (MVA time × season) was included to test whether the association between MVA time and lung function outcomes varied by warmer versus colder months.Results: On average, children spent less MVA time outdoors (38.2 ± 39.6 min/d) compared with indoors (71.9 ± 74.7 min/d, P < 0.01), regardless of season. The majority of outdoor MVA occurred along sidewalks and roadbeds (30.2 ± 33.3 min/d, 76.9% of outdoor) where annual average concentrations of NO2 were relatively high. Interquartile range (IQR) increase in outdoor MVA time (44 min) was associated with higher levels of annual average NO2 (P < 0.01) but not particulate matter <2.5 microns. In warmer months, for IQR increase in outdoor MVA time, children had 1.41% lower FEV1/FVC (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -2.46 to -0.36) and 4.40% lower percent predicted FEF25-75 (95% CI, -8.02 to -0.78). These results persisted even after adjustment for location-specific annual average concentrations of NO2. No association was observed between MVA time and lung function in colder months (P > 0.05), and a formal test for interaction (MVA time × season) was significant (P value for interaction = 0.01 and 0.03 for FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75, respectively).Conclusions: Children in NYC spent less time active outdoors compared with indoors. Outdoor activity was greatest near traffic sources and associated with higher annual average concentrations of NO2. In warmer months, outdoor activity was associated with lower lung function, but this association did not appear to be mediated by higher exposure to outdoor pollution during exercise.""","""['Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir', 'Kyung Hwa Jung', 'Michael Montilla', 'James Quinn', 'Jessie Cahill', 'Daniel Sheehan', 'Frederica Perera', 'Steven N Chillrud', 'Jeff Goldsmith', 'Matthew Perzanowski', 'Andrew Rundle', 'Rachel Miller']""","""[' Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons.', ' Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health.', ' Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health.', ' Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York; and.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health.', ' Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care of Medicine, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and.', ' Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.', ' Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Ann Am Thorac Soc""","""['Evaluating heterogeneity in indoor and outdoor air pollution using land-use regression and constrained factor analysis.', 'Long-term air pollution exposure and lung function in 15 year-old adolescents living in an urban and rural area in Germany: The GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts.', 'The Australian Child Health and Air Pollution Study (ACHAPS): A national population-based cross-sectional study of long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, asthma, and lung function.', 'NO2 and PM2.5 Exposures and Lung Function in Swiss Adults: Estimated Effects of Short-Term Exposures and Long-Term Exposures with and without Adjustment for Short-Term Deviations.', 'Residential exposure to outdoor air pollution and adult lung function, with focus on small airway obstruction.', 'Characteristics of peak exposure to black carbon pollution in school, commute and home environments among school children in an urban community.', 'Parental knowledge and usage of air quality in childhood asthma management.', 'Physical Exercise in the Context of Air Pollution: An Emerging Research Topic.', 'Personal Exposure to Black Carbon at School and Levels of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide in New York City.', 'Nitrogen Dioxide Pollutant Exposure and Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction in Urban Childhood Asthma: A Pilot Study.']"""

We sought to determine whether adulteration has shifted in recent years.  Methods:   Adults entering EDM events at nightclubs and dance festivals in NYC were surveyed in 2016 and 2019. We tested hair samples from a subsample of those reporting past-year ecstasy use using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Differences in unreported drug exposure and suspected adulteration were compared between 2016 (n = 90) and 2019 (n = 72).  Results:   MDMA detection was stable at 72-74%. We detected decreases in unreported use of methamphetamine (from 22.2% to 5.6% [P = .003], an 74.8% decrease), new psychoactive substances (from 31.1% to 2.8% [P < .001], a 91.0% decrease), and synthetic cathinones in particular (from 27.8% to 2.8% (P < .001, an 89.9% decrease). Unreported ketamine exposure increased from 18.9% to 34.7% (P = .022, an 83.6% increase).

We investigate the interrelationship between maternal viral suppression, maternal weight status, breastfeeding, and infants that are HEU.  Methods:   The Kabeho study followed 502 HEU infants in Kigali, Rwanda, for 24 months from 2013 to 2014. We use a structural equation modeling approach to investigate the dynamic relationships between viral suppression, maternal weight change, breastfeeding, and infant length-for-age z-score (LAZ) as defined by the WHO.  Results:   Older mothers are more likely to be virally suppressed and to breastfeed. Viral suppression and the mother being on antiretroviral treatment for longer were related to lower infant LAZ at three months. A more positive maternal weight change was related to higher infant LAZ at the end of each period. At 12 months, a higher infant LAZ was related to increased probability of continued breastfeeding. At 18 months, continued breastfeeding was related to lower LAZ, and food shortages were related to higher LAZ.

Understanding the role that diversity plays in surgical resident training may identify strategies that foster resident resiliency, optimize surgical training, and improve patient outcomes.  Objective:   To examine the implication of gender and visible minority (VM [ie, nonaboriginal people who are not White individuals]) status for resiliency and training experiences of general surgery residents in Canada.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this survey study, a 129-item questionnaire was emailed from May 2018 to July 2018 to all residents enrolled in all Canadian general surgery training programs during the 2017-2018 training year. Survey responses were extracted and categorized into 5 major themes. The survey was designed by the Resident Committee and reviewed by the Governing Board of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons. French and English versions of the survey were created, distributed, and administered using Google Forms.  Main outcomes and measures:   Survey questions were formulated to characterize resident diversity and training experience. Self-perceptions of diversity, mentorship, and training experience were evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale (1 for strongly disagree, 2 for disagree, 3 for neither agree or disagree, 4 for agree, and 5 for strongly agree) and open-ended responses. The frequency of perceived unprofessional workplace encounters was evaluated using a 5-point scale (1 for daily, 2 for weekly, 3 for monthly, 4 for annually, and 5 for never).  Results:   Of the 510 general surgery residents invited, a total of 210 residents (40.5%) completed the survey. Most respondents were younger than 30 years (119 [56.7%]), were women (112 [53.3%]), reported English as their first language (133 [63.3%]), did not identify as a VM (147 [70.0%]), had no dependents (184 [87.6%]), and were Canadian medical graduates (178 [84.8%]). Women residents who identified as VM compared with male residents who did not identify as a VM were less likely to agree or strongly agree that they had a collegial relationship with staff, (21 [63.6%] vs 61 [89.7%]; P = .01), to feel like they fit in with their training programs (21 [63.6%] vs 56 [82.3%]; P = .003), and to feel valued at work (15 [45.4%] vs 47 [69.1%]; P = .03). Both female residents and female residents who identified as VM described significant concerns about receiving fewer training opportunities because of their gender vs their male peers (54 [48.2%] vs 3 [3.0%]; P < .001). Ninety-one of 112 female residents (81.2%) reported feeling that their medical expertise was dismissed because of their gender at least once annually, with 37 women (33.0%) experiencing dismissal of their expertise at least once every week (P < .001). In contrast, 98% of male residents reported never experiencing dismissal of their medical expertise because of their gender. Similarly, residents with VM status vs those without VM status reported at least monthly dismissal of their expertise because of their race/ethnicity (9 of 63 [14.3%] vs 1 of 147 [0.7%]; P < .001).

Effort has been made to identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) is a novel classification that may identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examined the utility of Obj-SCD criteria to predict future cognitive decline and difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs) among individuals with PD.  Method:   The sample included 483 individuals newly diagnosed with PD. Participants were followed for a five-year span with yearly visits where they completed neuropsychological tests. Participants were categorized as cognitively normal (CN), the newly proposed Obj-SCD, PD-MCI or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Analyses determined if utilization of Obj-SCD criteria predicted subsequent cognitive impairment and difficulties with ADLs.  Results:   At baseline, 372 (77%) participants were classified as CN, 40 (8.3%) classified as Obj-SCD, and 71 (14.7%) classified as PD-MCI. Analyses revealed that relative to the CN group, participants classified as Obj-SCD at baseline, were more likely to develop PD-MCI or PDD within 5 years (odds ratio 2.413; 95% confidence interval 1.215-4.792). Furthermore, the Obj-SCD represented an intermediate level of impairment, relative to the CN and PD-MCI groups, on an independent measure of cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and ADL.  Conclusions:   Findings provide evidence that Obj-SCD criteria can identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline and impairments in ADL.

Objectives:   To evaluate OCS dose and timing on PTB for asthma and, as a comparison, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Methods:   We used health care data from California Medicaid enrollees linked to birth certificates (2007-2013), identifying women with asthma (n = 22,084) and SLE (n = 1174). We estimated risk ratios (RR) for OCS cumulative dose trajectories and other disease-related medications before gestational day 140 and hazard ratios (HR) for time-varying exposures after day 139.  Results:   For asthma, PTB risk was 14.0% for no OCS exposure and 14.3%, 16.8%, 20.5%, and 32.7% in low, medium, medium-high, and high cumulative dose trajectory groups, respectively, during the first 139 days. The high-dose group remained associated with PTB after adjustment (adjusted RR [aRR]: 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 2.15). OCS dose after day 139 was not clearly associated with PTB, nor were controller medications. For SLE, PTB risk for no OCS exposure was 24.9%, and it was 39.1% in low- and 61.2% in high-dose trajectory groups. aRR were 1.80 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.40) for high and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.58) for low groups.

In patients with CKD glomerular filtration rate category 3a (G3a) or worse, including those with kidney failure who are receiving dialysis, clinical practice guidelines suggest ""lowering elevated phosphate levels towards the normal range"" with possible strategies including dietary phosphate restriction or use of binders. Additionally, guidelines suggest restricting the use of oral elemental calcium often contained in phosphate binders. Nutrition guidelines in CKD suggest<800-1,000mg of calcium daily, whereas CKD bone and mineral disorder guidelines do not provide clear targets, but<1,500mg in maintenance dialysis patients has been previously recommended. Many different classes of phosphate binders are now available and clinical trials have not definitively demonstrated the superiority of any class of phosphate binders over another with regard to clinical outcomes. Use of phosphate binders contributes substantially to patients' pill burden and out-of-pocket costs, and many have side effects.

Blood collected from repeat-donors has provided the opportunity to follow blood donors over time and has been used to estimate the incidence of viral infections. These incidence estimates have been extrapolated to first-time donors using the ratio of NAT yield cases in first-time versus repeat-donors. We describe a model to estimate incidence in first-time donors using the limiting antigen (LAg) avidity assay and compare its results with those from established models.  Methods:   HIV-positive first-time donations were tested for recency using the LAg assay. Three models were compared; incidence estimated for (1) first-time donors using LAg avidity, (2) first-time and repeat-donors separately using the NAT yield window period (WP) model and (3) repeat-donors using the incidence/WP model.  Results:   HIV incidence in first-time donors was estimated at 3·32 (CI 3·11, 3·55) and 3·81 (CI 3·07, 4·73) per 1000 PY using the LAg assay and NAT yield WP models, respectively. Incidence in repeat-donors was between 2·0- and 2·5-fold lower than in first-time donors estimated at 1·56 (CI 1·37, 1·77) and 1·94 (CI 1·86-2·01) per 1000 PY using the NAT yield/WP and incidence/WP models, respectively.

Design:   We performed k-means cluster analyses using households' percentage of food and beverage purchases from each store type (i.e. convenience stores, traditional shops (e.g. bodegas, tiendas, mom-and-pop shops), supermarkets, wholesalers and others). We calculated adjusted mean proportions of taxed and untaxed products (ml or g/capita per d) purchased in each pattern. We studied the associations between households' SES and shopping patterns using multinomial logistic regressions. Within shopping patterns, we obtained mean volumes and proportions of taxed and untaxed food and beverage subgroups and calculated the proportion of products purchased at each store type.  Setting:   Mexico.  Participants:   Urban Mexican households (n 5493) from the Nielsen Mexico Consumer Panel Survey 2015.  Results:   We found four beverage shopping patterns and three food shopping patterns, driven by the store type where most purchases were made. For beverages, 48 % of households were clustered in the Traditional pattern and purchased the highest proportion of taxed beverages. Low-SES households had the highest probability of clustering in the Traditional beverage shopping pattern. For foods, 35 % of households were clustered into the Supermarket pattern. High-SES households had the highest probability of clustering in the Supermarket food shopping pattern.  Conclusions:   The combination of store types where Mexican households purchase packaged foods and beverages varies. However, households in all shopping patterns and SES purchase taxed beverages mainly at traditional stores.

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) could be a promising approach.  Approach and results:   In this phase 1, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients with AUD-related cirrhosis with problem drinking (AUDIT-10 > 8) were randomized 1:1 into receiving one placebo or FMT enema from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Six-month safety was the primary outcome. Alcohol craving questionnaire, alcohol consumption (urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine), quality of life, cognition, serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, plasma/stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and stool microbiota were tested at baseline and day 15. A 6-month follow-up with serious adverse event (SAE) analysis was performed. Twenty patients with AUD-related cirrhosis (65 ± 6.4 years, all men, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 8.9 ± 2.7) with similar demographics, cirrhosis, and AUD severity were included. Craving reduced significantly in 90% of FMT versus 30% in placebo at day 15 (P = 0.02) with lower urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine (P = 0.03) and improved cognition and psychosocial quality of life. There was reduction in serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and increased butyrate/isobutyrate compared with baseline in FMT but not placebo. Microbial diversity increased with higher Ruminococcaceae and other SCFAs, producing taxa following FMT but not placebo, which were linked with SCFA levels. At 6 months, patients with any SAEs (8 vs. 2, P = 0.02), AUD-related SAEs (7 vs. 1, P = 0.02), and SAEs/patient (median [interquartile range], 1.5 [1.25] vs. 0 [0.25] in FMT, P = 0.02) were higher in placebo versus FMT.  Conclusions:   This phase 1 trial shows that FMT is safe and associated with short-term reduction in alcohol craving and consumption with favorable microbial changes versus placebo in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with alcohol misuse.

Although the literature explores the intersection of alcohol use and vulnerability to HIV and AIDS, there is limited evidence on the gendered uptake and use of alcohol among adolescents. Capturing adolescents' voiced experiences about the societal influences shaping their alcohol usage is essential for identifying contextually relevant interventions to reduce their vulnerability to alcohol and related risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex. We conducted qualitative research in urban Tanzania, including key informant interviews, systematic mapping of alcohol availability, in-depth interviews with adolescents in and out of school and adults, and participatory methodologies with adolescents ages 15-19. The findings described here were drawn from the participatory methodologies (n = 177); and in-depth interviews with adolescents (n = 24) and adults (n = 24). Three key themes emerged: (1) boys' increased social vulnerability to alcohol consumption; (2) the ways in which stigma shapes girls' alcohol usage; and (3) how gendered perceptions of alcohol use reinforce societal inequalities.

Trabectedin is an antitumor agent with an effect on cancer cell proliferation and a modulating action on tumor microenvironment. The ATREUS study explored the activity and safety of trabectedin in patients with unresectable MPM.  Methods:   Epithelioid patients with MPM received trabectedin as second-line while biphasic/sarcomatoid patients with MPM as first- or second-line therapy. Treatment was given intravenously at an initially planned dose of 1.3 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks (PFS12wks).  Results:   Overall, 78 patients (54%) had epithelioid and 67 (46%) nonepithelioid MPM. PFS12wks in 62 evaluable patients with epithelioid MPM was 43.5% (80% confidence interval 34.9%-52.5%); median progression-free and overall survival were 2.4 and 9.0 months, respectively. PFS12wks in 52 evaluable patients with nonepithelioid MPM was 30.8% (90% confidence interval 20.3%-42.9%); median progression-free and overall survival were 1.7 and 5.4 months. Trabectedin starting dose was amended due to excess of liver toxicity. Eighty-four (64%) and 48 (36%) patients received 1.3 mg/m2 and 1.1. mg/m2, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were hepatotoxicity, leukopenia/neutropenia, and fatigue. Grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity was reported in 59 (70%) patients treated at 1.3 mg/m2, and in 19 (40%) treated at 1.1 mg/m2.

Understanding parents' preferences for smoking cessation messages may help clinicians tailor interventions to increase quitting.  Methods:   We conducted a discrete choice experiment in which parent smokers of pediatric patients rated the relative importance of 26 messages designed to increase smoking cessation treatment. Messages varied on who the message featured (child, parent, and family), whether the message was gain- or loss-framed (emphasizing benefits of engaging or costs of failing to engage in treatment), and the specific outcome included (eg, general health, cancer, respiratory illnesses, and financial impact). Participants included 180 parent smokers at 4 pediatric primary care sites. We used latent class analysis of message ratings to identify groups of parents with similar preferences. Multinomial logistic regression described child and parent characteristics associated with group membership.  Results:   We identified 3 groups of parents with similar preferences for messages: Group 1 prioritized the impact of smoking on the child (n = 92, 51%), Group 2 favored gain-framed messages (n = 63, 35%), and Group 3 preferred messages emphasizing the financial impact of smoking (n = 25, 14%). Parents in Group 2 were more likely to have limited health literacy and have a child over age 6 and with asthma, compared to Group 1.  Conclusions:   We identified 3 groups of parent smokers with different message preferences.

We found that, relative to wild-type littermates, the innate immunomodulator Lcn2 (lipocalin-2) was increased in normal airways from mice with knockout of the airway lineage gene Gprc5a (Gprc5a-/-) and that are prone to developing inflammation and LUAD. Yet, the role of LCN2 in lung inflammation and LUAD is poorly understood.Objectives: Delineate the role of Lcn2 induction in LUAD pathogenesis.Methods: Normal airway brushings, uninvolved lung tissues, and tumors from Gprc5a-/- mice before and after tobacco carcinogen exposure were analyzed by RNA sequencing. LCN2 mRNA was analyzed in public and in-house data sets of LUAD, lung squamous cancer (LUSC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and LUAD/LUSC with COPD. LCN2 protein was immunohistochemically analyzed in a tissue microarray of 510 tumors. Temporal lung tumor development, gene expression programs, and host immune responses were compared between Gprc5a-/- and Gprc5a-/-/Lcn2-/- littermates.Measurements and Main Results:Lcn2 was progressively elevated during LUAD development and positively correlated with proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation gene sets. LCN2 was distinctively elevated in human LUADs, but not in LUSCs, relative to normal lungs and was associated with COPD among smokers and patients with LUAD. Relative to Gprc5a-/- mice, Gprc5a-/-/Lcn2-/- littermates exhibited significantly increased lung tumor development concomitant with reduced T-cell abundance (CD4+) and richness, attenuated antitumor immune gene programs, and increased immune cell expression of protumor inflammatory cytokines.Conclusions: Augmented LCN2 expression is a molecular feature of COPD-associated LUAD and counteracts LUAD development in vivo by maintaining antitumor immunity.""","""['Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol', 'Maya Hassane', 'Ansam Sinjab', 'Kyle Chang', 'Kieko Hara', 'Zahraa Rahal', 'Jiexin Zhang', 'Wei Lu', 'Smruthy Sivakumar', 'Tina L McDowell', 'Jacob Kantrowitz', 'Jianling Zhou', 'Wenhua Lang', 'Li Xu', 'Joshua K Ochieng', 'Sayuri Nunomura-Nakamura', 'Shanshan Deng', 'Carmen Behrens', 'Maria Gabriela Raso', 'Junya Fukuoka', 'Alexandre Reuben', 'Edwin J Ostrin', 'Edwin Parra', 'Luisa M Solis', 'Avrum E Spira', 'Florencia McAllister', 'Tina Cascone', 'Ignacio I Wistuba', 'Seyed Javad Moghaddam', 'Paul A Scheet', 'Junya Fujimoto', 'Humam Kadara']""","""[' Department of Translational Molecular Pathology.', ' Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and.', ' Department of Epidemiology.', ' Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', ' Department of Bioinformatics and Computer Biology.', ' Section of Computational Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; and.', ' Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', ' Department of Pulmonary Medicine.', ' Department of Thoracic Head and Neck Medical Oncology.', '0 Department of General Internal Medicine, and.', '1 Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Am J Respir Crit Care Med""","""['Therapeutic Interception of Early Lung Adenocarcinoma Progression: Not Just How, but When?', 'Development of Kras mutant lung adenocarcinoma in mice with knockout of the airway lineage-specific gene Gprc5a.', 'Increased serum levels of lipocalin-1 and -2 in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.', 'G-protein coupled receptor family C, group 5, member A (GPRC5A) expression is decreased in the adjacent field and normal bronchial epithelia of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Comprehensive review of lipocalin 2-mediated effects in lung inflammation.', 'Lipocalin-2 expression and function in pancreatic diseases.', 'Markers of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome after Lung Transplant: Between Old Knowledge and Future Perspective.', 'Pathogenesis of Tobacco-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Is Closely Coupled with Changes in the Gut and Lung Microbiomes.', 'Homeobox A1 Facilitates Immune Escape and Alleviates Oxidative Stress in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Chronic Exposure to Waterpipe Smoke Elicits Immunomodulatory and Carcinogenic Effects in the Lung.', 'ZNF143 Expression is Associated with COPD and Tumor Microenvironment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

The study aimed to compare quality of life in patients diagnosed with cancer and diabetes with those without diabetes both undergoing chemotherapy and to investigate the factors responsible for the difference between the two groups.  Methods:   A convenience sample of 101 participants who had cancer and type 2 diabetes and 99 who had cancer without diabetes were used.  Results:   Patients with comorbid diabetes were divided based on their diabetes duration and whether they had glycaemic control or not. Diabetic cancer patients without glycaemic control had lower scores in global health status and in physical and emotional functioning compared to diabetic cancer patients with glycaemic control and patients without diabetes (p < .05). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, the differences between the group with diabetes and without glycaemic control and the other two groups regarding global health status were statistically significant (p < .05). Patients with more than a 7-year history of diabetes had a significantly lower emotional functioning than the no diabetes group and lower global health status score than both of the other groups (p < .05). After adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, only the difference between the ≥ 7 years diabetes duration group and the no diabetes groups remained significant.

Methods:   Patients receiving chemotherapy (n = 957) completed measures of general, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress and symptom inventories. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct stress profiles.  Results:   Three distinct subgroups of patients were identified (i.e., stressed [39.3%], normative [54.3%], resilient [5.7%]). For cognitive function, significant differences were found among the latent classes (stressed < normative < resilient). For both sleep disturbance and morning and evening fatigue, compared to the normative and resilient classes, the stressed class reported higher severity scores. Compared to the normative and resilient classes, the stressed class reported low levels of morning energy. Compared to the normative class, the stressed class reported lower levels of evening energy.

Methods:   We conducted a multiphase development and testing process: 1) individual, semistructured interviews with parents and clinicians (pediatric and general emergency medicine [EM] physicians and pediatric EM nurses) to learn their preferences for a communication and SDM tool; 2) design of a ""storyboard"" of the tool with design impression testing; 3) development of a software application (i.e., app) prototype, called e-Care; and 4) usability testing of e-Care, using qualitative assessment and the system usability scale (SUS).  Results:   We interviewed 27 parents and 23 clinicians. Interviews revealed several themes, including that a communication tool should augment but not replace verbal communication; a Web-based format was preferred; and information about infections and testing, including the rationales for specific tests, would be valuable. We then developed separate versions of e-Care for infants ≤ 28 days and 29 to 60 days of age, in both English and Spanish. The e-Care app includes four sections: 1) homepage; 2) why testing is done; 3) what tests are done; and 4) what happens after testing, including a table for parents of infants 29 to 60 days of age to compare the risks/benefits of LP in preparation for an SDM conversation.

Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality and hospitalization rates seen in this PA/LTC facility outbreak are significantly lower than has been documented in other facility outbreaks. Our multidisciplinary approach centered on telemedicine should be considered as other PA/LTC facilities partner with neighboring health care systems in responding to COVID-19 outbreaks. We have begun replicating these services to additional PA/LTC facilities facing COVID-19 outbreaks.""","""['Drew A Harris', 'Laurie Archbald-Pannone', 'Jasveen Kaur', 'David Cattell-Gordon', 'Karen S Rheuban', 'Rachel L Ombres', 'Kimberly Albero', 'Rebecca Steele', 'Taison D Bell', 'Justin B Mutter']""","""[' Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', ' Division of General, Geriatric, Hospital and Palliative Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', ' Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', ' Center for Telehealth, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Telemed J E Health""","""['Virtual Daily Rounding for COVID-19 Facility Outbreaks: A Standardized Telehealth-Centered Approach May Reduce Hospital Transfers and Mortality.', 'Non-pharmacological measures implemented in the setting of long-term care facilities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences: a rapid review.', 'Modelling resource requirements and physician staffing to provide virtual urgent medical care for residents of long-term care homes: a cross-sectional study.', 'The Coronavirus and the Risks to the Elderly in Long-Term Care.', 'Protecting Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities From COVID-19: A Rapid Review of International Evidence.', 'Implementation, uptake and use of a digital COVID-19 symptom tracker in English care homes in the coronavirus pandemic: a mixed-methods, multi-locality case study.', 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place: COVID-19 Lessons Learned From Providers Rounding at Skilled Nursing Facilities in the Rural Midwest.', 'Does telehealth influence the decision to transfer residents of residential aged care facilities to emergency departments?

Reducing impulsive choice may prove beneficial in ameliorating these maladaptive behaviors. Preclinical research in rats indicates that one reliable method for producing large and lasting reductions in impulsive choice is delay-exposure (DE) training. In all six of the prior DE-training experiments, rats were given extensive experience (~ 120 training sessions) with a delayed reinforcement contingency. The present experiment evaluated if similar large and lasting reductions in impulsive choice could be achieved with less training. The duration of DE training between groups of male Wistar rats was 0 sessions (training ended after a lever-pressing acquisition criterion was met), 30, 60, or 120 sessions. Comparison groups were given the same durations of training with immediate reinforcement. A post-training assessment of impulsive choice was completed using an increasing-delay procedure. For rats assigned to the 60-session condition, impulsive choice was reassessed at a 120-day follow-up. DE training reduced impulsive choice but, contrary to expectation, reductions in impulsive choice did not increase with DE-training duration (no significant training-duration by group interaction). Importantly, 60 sessions of DE training produced reductions in impulsive choice that were comparable to prior published findings and this effect remained significant at the 120-day follow-up. Procedural elements that may be responsible for the DE-training effect, and how they could be improved in future experiments, are discussed.""","""['C Renee Renda', 'Jillian M Rung', 'Sara Peck', 'Gregory J Madden']""","""[' Department of Psychology, Utah State University, 2810 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84341, USA. rendarenee@gmail.com.', ' Department of Psychology, Utah State University, 2810 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84341, USA.', ' Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health and Health Professions, School of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Anim Cogn""","""['Reducing impulsive choice: VIII.

Study design:   Data were collected prospectively for infants weighing <1501 g and born at <37 weeks of gestation admitted to centers of the Neonatal Research Network of Japan during 2003-2016. We compared outcomes of infants with and without birth defects using Pearson χ2 test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, log-rank test, nominal logistic regression analysis, and stratified analysis by birth defect subgroups. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine.  Results:   Among 57 730 VLBW preterm infants, 3557 infants (6.2%) were born with birth defects. Chromosomal abnormalities, congenital heart defects, and congenital malformation of the digestive system were the most common categories. Among diseases, Trisomy 18, Down syndrome, and cleft palate were the most prevalent. There were significant differences between perinatal characteristics of infants with and without birth defects. Most categories of morbidity occurred more frequently in infants with birth defects compared with those without birth defects. The aOR for mortality during the neonatal intensive care unit admission was 10.6 (95% CI 9.5-11.7) for infants with birth defects. A stratified analysis identified birth defect categories with good, moderate, and poor prognoses.

However, it is unclear whether the use of one product precedes the other-an important consideration, given the new climate surrounding marijuana legalization and the popularity of e-cigarette products.  Methods:   Six-panel cross-lagged regression models, with 6 months between each panel/wave, were used to model bidirectional paths between past 30-day use and comorbid use of marijuana and tobacco products from 2014 to 2017 among young adults (N = 5,221 college students, aged 18-25 years).  Results:   Combustible tobacco use and e-cigarette use were prospectively associated with greater risk of future marijuana use while controlling for the stability of use over time, age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Marijuana use was prospectively associated with greater risk of future combustible tobacco and e-cigarette use. Comorbid use was common, but while the odds of comorbid use decreased with increasing age, odds of tobacco use increased.  Conclusions:   More young adults may be consolidating their use than are successfully ceasing their tobacco or marijuana use as they mature through young adulthood. Although we observed decreases in comorbid use of combustible tobacco with marijuana and e-cigarettes with marijuana, we simultaneously observed strong stability in single use of these products over time. Taken together, these results should help structure interventions specific to young adults that target use and comorbid use in early young adulthood to discourage initiation, encourage cessation, and curb subsequent escalation in later young adulthood.""","""['Shannon M Rogers', 'Alexandra Loukas', 'Melissa B Harrell', 'Baojiang Chen', 'Andrew Springer', 'Cheryl L Perry']""","""[' University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), School of Public Health, Austin, Texas.', ' Health Behavior and Health Education, Department of Kinesiology & Health Education, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.

This study compared patient-reported post-discharge pain scores for patients treated before and after the change in routine discharge medication.  Methods:   Patients were categorized based on treatment before and after a change in discharge medication as follows: study period 1 (routine opioids), study period 2 (routine NSAID).

The maximum reported pain score on any POD for all the patients was severe for 30 patients (3.8%), moderate for 217 patients (28%), mild for 430 patients (54%), and none for 112 patients (14%). The estimated risk for moderate or greater pain on POD 1 was 36% for period 1 and 34% for period 2. The proportion of patients reporting moderate or greater pain was nonsignificantly lower for the patients treated in period 2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI 0.67-1.22; P = 0.5).  Conclusions:   For patients undergoing lump/ex, a clinically meaningful difference in reported post-discharge pain scores can be excluded with a change to routine NSAID at discharge. Patients undergoing lump/ex should not be routinely discharged with opioids.""","""['Tracy-Ann Moo', 'Melissa Assel', 'Rubaya Yeahia', 'Ryan Nierstedt', 'Kimberly J Van Zee', 'Laurie J Kirstein', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Monica Morrow', 'Rebecca Twersky']""","""[' Breast Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Biostatistics Service, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Josie Robertson Surgery Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. twerskyr@mskcc.org.', ' Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Josie Robertson Surgery Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. twerskyr@mskcc.org.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Changing the Default: A Prospective Study of Reducing Discharge Opioid Prescription after Lumpectomy and Sentinel Node Biopsy.', 'Postdischarge Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Are not Associated with Risk of Hematoma after Lumpectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy with Multimodal Analgesia.', 'Postoperative Prescription of Low-dose Narcotics Yields Equivalent Pain Outcomes Compared to High-dose Narcotics in Opioid-naïve Patients Undergoing Spine Surgery.', 'Reassessing Opioid Use in Breast Surgery.', 'The effect of surgical pain severity, preoperative opioid use and patient characteristics on postoperative opioid prescriptions and refills in orthopedic surgery.', 'Variation in opioid filling after same-day breast surgery in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study.', 'Opioid-Sparing Multimodal Analgesia Protocol for Lumpectomy Patients Results in Superior Postoperative Pain Control.']"""

Study design:   Annual national statistics of death causes for 14 Western European countries from 2005 to 2015 were analyzed. SUDI cases were defined as infants younger than 1 year with the underlying cause of death classified as ""sudden infant death syndrome,"" ""unknown/unattended/unspecified cause,"" or ""accidental threats to breathing."" Poisson regression models were used to study temporal trends of SUDI rates and source of variation.  Results:   From 2005 to 2015, SUDI accounted for 15 617 deaths, for an SUDI rate of 34.9 per 100 000 live births. SUDI was the second most common cause of death after the neonatal period (22.2%) except in Belgium, Finland, France, and the UK, where it ranked first. The overall SUDI rate significantly decreased from 40.2 to 29.9 per 100 000, with a significant rate reduction experienced for 6 countries, no significant evolution for 7 countries, and a significant increase for Denmark. The sudden infant death syndrome/SUDI ratio was 56.7%, with a significant decrease from 64.9% to 49.7% during the study period, and ranged from 6.1% in Portugal to 97.8% in Ireland. We observed between-country variations in SUDI and sudden infant death syndrome sex ratios.  Conclusions:   In studied countries, SUDI decreased during the study period but remained a major cause of infant deaths, with marked between-country variations in rates, trends, and components.

The objective of this analysis was to characterize the role of AUIs in the morbidity associated with CCM exposure in children.  Methods:   This surveillance study collected data from 5 United States data sources from 2009 to 2016, in children younger than 6 years with an AE from an AUI involving at least 1 CCM over-the-counter pharmaceutical ingredient. An expert panel reviewed each case to determine causality.  Results:   From 4756 total cases reviewed, 3134 (65.9%) had an AE from an AUI determined to be at least potentially related to a CCM ingredient. The majority (61.3%) of cases occurred in children aged 2 to younger than 4 years. Most exposures occurred in the child's own residence (94.9%), and 43.8% were admitted to a health care facility (22.0% to a critical care unit). Dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine, when packaged alone or in combination products, contributed to 96.0% of AUIs. The most common specific products involved were single-ingredient pediatric liquid diphenhydramine (30.1%) and single-ingredient pediatric liquid dextromethorphan (21.4%). There were 3 deaths from solid diphenhydramine formulations.  Conclusions:   There continues to be opportunities for the implementation of interventions to prevent AUIs of CCM in children. Additional emphasis on engineering controls, such as flow restrictors for liquid formulations targeting diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan products, represent additional opportunities to further reduce AEs from AUIs of CCM.""","""['George Sam Wang', 'Kate M Reynolds', 'William Banner', 'G Randall Bond', 'Ralph E Kauffman', 'Robert B Palmer', 'Ian M Paul', 'Malin Rapp-Olsson', 'Jody L Green', 'Richard C Dart']""","""[' Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety, Denver Health and Hospital Authority, Denver, CO.', ' Oklahoma Center for Poison and Drug Information, Oklahoma University College of Pharmacy, Oklahoma City, OK.', ' Faculté de Médecine, Hope Africa University, Bujumbura, Burundi.', ' Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO.', ' Pediatrics and Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Emerg Care""","""['Trends in adverse events and related health-care facility utilization from cough and cold medication exposures in children.', 'Adverse events associated with diphenhydramine in children, 2008-2015.', 'Medication Errors From Over-the-Counter Cough and Cold Medications in Children.', 'Over-the-counter cough and cold medication use in young children.', 'Revisiting the safety of over-the-counter cough and cold medications in the pediatric population.']"""

We estimated the association of an individual's incident cancer diagnosis (exposure) with their own (primary outcome) and their spouse's (negative control outcome) memory decline in 3601 couples from 1998 to 2014 in the Health and Retirement Study, using linear mixed-effects models.

Methods:   Two hundred and thirty-five adults (21-84 yr of age) completed 5-min level treadmill walking bouts between 0.22 and 2.24 m·s, increasing by 0.22 m·s for each bout. Cadence (in steps per minute) was derived by dividing directly observed steps by bout duration. Intensity (oxygen uptake; in milliliters per kilogram per minute) was measured using indirect calorimetry. A simple CME was developed by fitting a least-squares regression to the cadence-intensity relationship, and a full CME was developed through best subsets regression with candidate predictors of age, sex, height, leg length, body mass, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat. Predictive accuracy of each CME and the ACSM metabolic equation was evaluated at normal (0.89-1.56 m·s) and all (0.22-2.24 m·s) walking speeds through k-fold cross-validation and converted to METs (1 MET = 3.5 mL·kg·min).  Results:   On average, the simple CME predicted intensity within ~1.8 mL·kg·min (~0.5 METs) at normal walking speeds and with negligible (<0.01 METs) bias. Including age, leg length, and BMI in the full CME marginally improved predictive accuracy (≤0.36 mL·kg·min [≤0.1 METs]), but may account for larger (up to 2.5 mL·kg·min [0.72 MET]) deviations in the cadence-intensity relationships of outliers in age, stature, and/or BMI. Both CME demonstrated 23%-35% greater accuracy and 2.2-2.8 mL·kg·min (0.6-0.8 METs) lower bias than the ACSM metabolic equation's speed-based predictions.  Conclusions:   Although the ACSM metabolic equation incorporates a grade component and is convenient for treadmill-based applications, the CME developed herein enables accurate quantification of walking intensity using a metric that is accessible during overground walking, as is common in free-living contexts.""","""['Christopher C Moore', 'Elroy J Aguiar', 'Scott W Ducharme', 'Catrine Tudor-Locke']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.', ' Department of Kinesiology, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL.', ' Department of Kinesiology, California State University Long Beach, Long Beach, CA.', ' College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Cadence-based classification of moderate-intensity overground walking in 41- to 85-year-old adults.', 'Walking cadence (steps/min) and intensity in 41 to 60-year-old adults: the CADENCE-adults study.', 'Cadence-based Classification of Minimally Moderate Intensity During Overground Walking in 21- to 40-Year-Old Adults.', 'Using cadence to study free-living ambulatory behaviour.', 'How fast is fast enough?

Recent studies, however, have suggested that hypercapnia and chronic intermittent hypoxia may potentially provide protection against ischemic events like stroke.  Objective:   To evaluate the impact of OSA with presentation, hospital course, and treatment outcomes of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  Methods:   Data for patients with SAH between the years 2011 and 2015 were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and stratified based on diagnosis codes for OSA. Univariate analysis was used to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in OSA patients diagnosed with SAH and several covariates, including patient demographics, aneurysmal treatment, in-hospital morality rate, length of stay, and costs. Multivariate logistic regression models analyzed the relationship between several comorbidities, including OSA, tobacco use, and hypertension, and poor outcomes after SAH.  Results:   Data from 49 265 SAH patients were used in this study, of which 2408 (4.9%) also had a concomitant OSA diagnosis. Patients with OSA compared to all other SAH patients had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate, as well as statistically significant lower odds of vasospasm, stroke, and poor outcomes. Additionally, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and tobacco use disorder were also associated with more favorable outcomes.

Methods:   Consecutive patients with stage I-III breast cancer treated with NAC from November 2013 to March 2019 were identified. BCS eligibility before and after NAC was prospectively determined. Patients deemed BCSi before NAC due to large tumor size were studied. Statistical analyses were conducted using Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Chi-square test, Fisher's test, and logistic regression.  Results:   In this study, 600 of 1353 cancers were BCSi with large tumors; 69% were non-BCS candidates, 31% were borderline-BCS (bBCS) candidates. Of non-BCS candidates, 69% became BCSe after NAC; 66% chose BCS, and 90% were successful. Among bBCS candidates, 87% were BCSe after NAC, 73% chose BCS, and 96% were successful. On univariate analysis, bBCS candidacy, lower cT stage, cN0 status, absence of calcifications, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+)/triple negative (TN) receptor status, poor differentiation, ductal histology, and breast pCR were associated with conversion to BCS eligibility. On multivariable analysis, receptor status (hormone receptor positive [HR+]/HER2- ref; odds ratio [OR] HER2+ 1.63, P = 0.047; HR-/HER2- OR, 2.26, P = 0.003) and breast pCR (OR 2.62, P < 0.001) predicted successful downstaging, while larger clinical tumor size (OR 0.86, P = 0.003), non-BCS candidacy (OR 0.46, P = 0.003), cN+ status (OR 0.54, P = 0.008), and calcifications (OR 0.56, P = 0.007) predicted lower downstaging rates.  Conclusion:   In patients with large tumors precluding BCS, conversion to BCS eligibility was high with NAC, particularly in bBCS candidates.

As sex hormones change with age, gender, and metabolic syndrome, we hypothesized that sex hormones may underlie the physiologic changes affecting stone formation.  Methods:   We analyzed the relationships between testosterone, estradiol, and history of kidney stones using data from 10,193 participants in the Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 2013-2016. We performed logistic regression analysis to analyze the predictive value of low testosterone and low estradiol on the history of kidney stones in both males and females. Self-reported history of kidney stone diagnosis was the outcome.  Results:   After adjusting for risk factors known to be associated with nephrolithiasis such as age, race, BMI, and medical comorbidities including: gout, angina, coronary disease, stroke, asthma, hypertension, and diabetes, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that there is no independent association between sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and history of kidney stones in either males or females.  Conclusions:   There appears to be no association between sex hormones and history of kidney stones. Whether there is a more complex interaction of sex hormone levels and the shared association with factors such as metabolic syndrome requires additional investigation. Further studies matching menopausal status for women are necessary to further investigate the potential relationship between estrogen and kidney stones.""","""['Sirpi Nackeeran', 'Jonathan Katz', 'Ranjith Ramasamy', 'Robert Marcovich']""","""[' Department of Urology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA. sirpi.n@gmail.com.', ' Department of Urology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""World J Urol""","""['Urolithiasis/Endourology.', 'Relationship Between Serum Testosterone Levels and Kidney Stones Prevalence in Men.', 'Serum estradiol and testosterone levels in kidney stones disease with and without calcium oxalate components in naturally postmenopausal women.', 'Prevalence and Trends in Kidney Stone Among Adults in the USA: Analyses of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2018 Data.', 'Antioxidants and self-reported history of kidney stones: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Incidence of Kidney Stones in the United States: The Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Global, Regional, and National Burden of Urolithiasis from 1990 to 2019: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.', 'Sex disparities and the risk of urolithiasis: a large cross-sectional study.', 'Relationship Between Serum Testosterone Levels and Kidney Stones Prevalence in Men.', 'The Association of Urine Creatinine With Kidney Stone Prevalence in US Adults: Data From NHANES 2009-2018.', 'Effect of comfort care on pain degree and nursing satisfaction in patients undergoing kidney stone surgery.']"""

The SSO-ASTRO guidelines advise 2 mm margins for patients with DCIS having BCS and whole-breast radiation (WBRT). Here we examine guideline impact on additional surgery and factors associated with re-excision.  Patients and methods:   Patients treated with BCS for pure DCIS from August 2015 to January 2018 were identified. Guidelines were adopted on September 1, 2016, and all patients had separately submitted cavity-shave margins. Clinicopathologic characteristics, margin status, and rates of additional surgery were examined.  Results:   Among 650 patients with DCIS who attempted BCS, 50 (8%) converted to mastectomy. Of 600 who had BCS as final surgery, 336 (56%) received WBRT and comprised our study group. One hundred twenty-eight (38%) were treated pre-guideline and 208 (62%) were treated post-guideline. Characteristics and margin status were similar between groups. The re-excision rate was 38% pre-guideline adoption and 29% post-guideline adoption (p = 0.09), with 91% having only one re-excision. Re-excision for ≥ 2 mm margins was uncommon (6% pre-guideline vs. 5% post-guideline). On multivariate analysis, younger age (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99, p = 0.02) and larger DCIS size (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, p < 0.001) were predictive of re-excision; guideline era was not. Younger age (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.9-0.97, p < 0.001) and larger size (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.3-2.1, p < 0.001) were predictive of conversion to mastectomy, but residual tumor burden was low.  Conclusions:   The SSO-ASTRO guidelines did not significantly change re-excision rates for DCIS in our practice, likely since re-excision for margins ≥ 2 mm was uncommon even prior to guideline adoption, dissimilar to historically observed variations in surgeon practices.

We find that the states and repertoires of CD8+ T cells are not distinct in tumors compared with non-malignant tissues. In contrast, single-cell analysis of CD4+ T cells demonstrates several tumor-specific states, including multiple distinct states of regulatory T cells. Surprisingly, we also find multiple cytotoxic CD4+ T cell states that are clonally expanded. These CD4+ T cells can kill autologous tumors in an MHC class II-dependent fashion and are suppressed by regulatory T cells.

Materials and methods:   This study uses the University of California, San Francisco Geriatric Urology Database to examine all adults ages ≥65 years who underwent urodynamic testing from December 2015 to April 2019. All subjects had a timed up and go test (TUGT) as a measure of frailty and were categorized as fast (≤10 seconds), intermediate (11-14 seconds), or slow (≥15 seconds), corresponding to not frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. Urodynamic studies were reviewed for the presence of DO. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine the relationship between frailty, age, and the presence of DO.  Results:   In total, 549 older adults underwent urodynamics during the study period, and 48.5% had a study that demonstrated DO. Individuals with DO tended to be older (18.4% vs 11.0% were ≥80 years; P = .01) and more frail (19.5% vs 13.4% with TUGT ≥5 seconds; P < .01). Multivariate regression demonstrated that DO was associated with both pre-frail and frail TUGT times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.4; P < .01 for TUGT 11-14 seconds, and aOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0; P = .02 for TUGT ≥15 seconds). Age was not found to be significantly associated with DO (P's > .05).  Conclusions:   Frailty, not age, is associated with DO among older adults undergoing urodynamics.

Our objective was to use a discrete choice experiment to identify factors influencing surgical decision-making for older adults with thyroid cancer.  Methods:   Active and candidate members of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons were invited to participate in a web-based survey. Multinomial logistic regression was utilized to assess patient and surgeon factors associated with treatment choices.  Results:   Complete survey response rate was 25.7%. Most respondents were high-volume surgeons (88.5%) at academic centers (76.9%). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated that patient age was the strongest predictor of management. Increasing age and comorbidities were associated with the choice for active surveillance (P = .000), not performing a lymphadenectomy in patients with nodal metastases (relative-risk ratio: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.2, P = .002 and relative-risk ratio: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1, P = .004, respectively), and recommending hemithyroidectomy versus total thyroidectomy for a cancer >4 cm (relative-risk ratio: 4.4, 95% CI: 2.5-7.9, P = .000 and relative-risk ratio: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.3-5.1, P = .000, respectively). Surgeons with ≥10 years of experience (relative-risk ratio: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.1-10.3, P = .039) favored total thyroidectomy for a cancer <4 cm, and nonfellowship trained surgeons (relative-risk ratio: 7.3, 95% CI: 1.3-42.2, P = .027) opted for thyroidectomy without lymphadenectomy for lateral neck nodal metastases.

Methods:   Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment using Central Nervous System Vital Signs 1 d before (T0) and 3 mo after surgery (T3). Patients' standardized scores on 7 cognitive domains were compared to a normative sample using one-sample z tests. Reliable change indices with correction for practice effects were calculated to assess cognitive changes in individual patients over time. Logistic regression models were performed to assess presurgical sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and cognitive risk factors for postoperative cognitive impairments.  Results:   At T0, 208 patients were assessed, and 136 patients were retested at T3. Patients showed significantly lower performance both prior to and 3 mo after surgery on all cognitive domains compared to healthy controls. Improvements and declines over time occurred respectively in 11% to 32% and 6% to 26% of the GBM patients over the domains. The regression models showed that low preoperative cognitive performance posits a significant risk factor for postoperative cognitive impairment on all domains, and female sex was a risk factor for postoperative impairments in Visual Memory.  Conclusion:   We demonstrated preoperative cognitive risk factors that enable the identification of GBM patients who are at risk for cognitive impairment 3 mo after surgery.

Four classes were selected based on model fit parameters: (Class 1) consistently retained and suppressed (>90% probability of being retained and suppressed), (Class 2) not consistently retained or suppressed (≤10% probability of being retained and suppressed), (Class 3) increasingly retained and suppressed, and (Class 4) decreasingly retained and suppressed. The proportion of women in each class was 48.6%, 24.9%, 14.3%, and 12.2%, respectively. Women aged 25-34 compared to 35-49 years old, injection drug use mode of exposure, US born, and not linked to care three months post-diagnosis had a lower prevalence of belonging to the consistently retained and suppressed class. Findings may be useful in tailoring and targeting interventions to increase the prevalence of women who are consistently retained in care and virally suppressed.""","""['Rahel Dawit', 'Diana M Sheehan', 'Semiu O Gbadamosi', 'Kristopher P Fennie', 'Tan Li', 'Danielle Curatolo', 'Lorene M Maddox', 'Emma C Spencer', 'Mary Jo Trepka']""","""[' Department of Epidemiology, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', ' Center for Research on U.S. Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', ' Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI), Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', ' Division of Natural Sciences, New College of Florida, Sarasota, FL, USA.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', ' HIV/AIDS Section, Florida Department of Health, Tallahassee, FL, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""AIDS Care""","""['Retention in HIV Care and Viral Suppression: Individual- and Neighborhood-Level Predictors of Racial/Ethnic Differences, Florida, 2015.', 'The HIV Care Continuum: Changes over Time in Retention in Care and Viral Suppression.', 'Individual and neighborhood predictors of retention in care and viral suppression among Florida youth (aged 13-24) living with HIV in 2015.', 'Annual and durable HIV retention in care and viral suppression among patients of Peter Ho Clinic, 2013-2017.', 'Antiretroviral prescription, retention in care and viral suppression by place of birth among adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States-2015-2017, medical monitoring project.', 'HIV awareness and prevention strategies among transgender women in the Eastern and Southern United States: findings from the LITE Study.', 'Factors Associated with Viral Suppression Among Racial/Ethnic Minority Women in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program, 2017.']"""

Assessment of the location of the a positive margin and the specific site of local recurrence has not been well described.  Methods:   A prospectively maintained database was queried for patients who underwent R0/R1 pancreaticoduodenectomy for PDAC between 2000 and 2015. The pancreatic, posterior, gastric/duodenal, anterior peritoneal, and bile duct margins were routinely assessed. Postoperative imaging was reviewed for the site of first recurrence, and local recurrence was defined as recurrence located in the remnant pancreas, surgical bed, or retroperitoneal site outside the surgical bed.  Results:   During the study period, 891 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and 390 patients had an initial local recurrence with or without distant metastases. The 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence by site included the remnant pancreas (4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3-5%), the surgical bed (35%; 95% CI, 32-39%), and other regional retroperitoneal site (4%; 95% CI, 3-6%). In the univariate analysis, positive posterior margin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.17-1.91; p = 0.001) and positive lymph nodes (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06-1.75; p = 0.017) were associated with surgical bed recurrence, and in the multivariate analysis, positive posterior margin remained significant (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09-1.81; p = 0.009). An isolated local recurrence was found in 197 patients, and a positive posterior margin was associated with surgical bed recurrence in this subgroup (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.08-2.10; p = 0.016).  Conclusion:   In this study, the primary association between site of margin positivity and site of local recurrence was between the posterior margin and surgical bed recurrence.

It is unknown how drug use problem severity modulates the association between IPV and observed conflict behaviors. As part of a larger clinical trial, a sample of 30 different-sex substance-misusing couples completed self-report questionnaires and participated in a laboratory conflict resolution task. The current exploratory study tested whether drug use severity moderated the association between IPV perpetration and positive and negative conflict resolution behaviors, respectively, while controlling for IPV victimization. The results suggest that among men, drug use severity moderates the association between psychological IPV perpetration and negative conflict behaviors. Men who report more severe IPV display more negative behaviors when their drug use problems are more severe. Among women, drug use severity moderated the effect between psychological IPV perpetration and negative conflict behaviors among women, such that women with lower drug use problem severity displayed more negative conflict behaviors when psychological IPV perpetration was more versus less severe. Drug use severity also moderated the association between physical IPV perpetration and negative and positive conflict behaviors among women. That is, women who reported more severe physical IPV displayed more negative and fewer positive behaviors when their drug use problems were more severe. Results have preliminary implications for targeting conflict resolution strategies differentially in men and women with drug use and a history of IPV perpetration. Future studies should replicate the current findings in larger, more representative samples, and examine the role specific drugs have on the association between IPV and conflict behaviors.""","""['Amber M Jarnecke PhD', 'Ruschelle M Leone PhD', 'Charli Kirby Ba', 'Julianne C Flanagan PhD']""","""[' Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.', ' Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA.', ' Ralph H.

In total, 66.7% (26/39) of the CR-hvKP isolates were found to carry 16S rRNA methylase genes. The most frequently detected 16S rRNA methylase gene was armA (11/26, 42.3%), followed by rmtB (8/26, 30.8%), and coexistence of both armA and rmtB (7/26, 26.9%). All the clinical isolates were found to carry at least one carbapenemase gene, with blaKPC-2 (79.5%, 31/39), blaNDM-1 (10.3%, 4/39), and cocarrying blaKPC-2 and blaNDM-1 (10.3%, 4/39). A total of 89.7% (35/39) isolates carried extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes, including 61.5% (24/39) blaSHV-1, 71.8% (28/39) blaTEM-1, and 89.7% (35/39) blaCTX-M-14. All except four isolates (89.7%, 35/39) harbored quinolone resistance genes, with qnrS (82.1%, 32/39), aac(6')-Ib-cr (79.5%, 31/39), and qnrB (2.6%, 1/39). Twenty-six hvKP strains in this study were first reported to cocarry carbapenemase genes, ESBL genes, quinolone resistance genes, and 16S rRNA methylase genes simultaneously. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis assigned the 39 CR-hvKP isolates into 4 sequence types (STs), with ST11 encompassing 79.5% of the strains. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing showed that strains closely related by MLST clustered in major PFGE clusters, of which cluster A accounts for 31 ST11 isolates. Cumulatively, 16S rRNA methylase genes are highly prevalent in CR-hvKP clinical isolates especially for ST11; it is, therefore, critical to continuously monitor the epidemiology of these 16S rRNA methylase-producing CR-hvKP while simultaneously minimizing potential risks from aminoglycoside-resistant CR-hvKP.""","""['Wenjian Liao', 'Liang De Wang', 'Dan Li', 'Fang-Ling Du', 'Dan Long', 'Yang Liu', 'OonTek Ng', 'Wei Zhang']""","""[' Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', ' National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Infectious Disease Research Laboratory, Singapore, Singapore.', ' Department of Clinical Microbiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', ' Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Microb Drug Resist""","""['Characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, carbapenemase, and plasmid quinolone determinants in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying distinct types of 16S rRNA methylase genes, and their association with mobile genetic elements.', 'High Prevalence of Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance Determinants Among Serotype K1 Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae Isolates in China.', 'Isolation and characterization of a sequence type 25 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae from the mid-south region of China.', 'Molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant serotype K1 hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 harbouring blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-48 carbapenemases in Iran.', 'Prevalence of 16S rRNA methylase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a Chinese teaching hospital: coexistence of rmtB and armA genes in the same isolate.', 'Research Updates of Plasmid-Mediated Aminoglycoside Resistance 16S rRNA Methyltransferase.', 'Pathogenic Characteristics and Risk Factors for ESKAPE Pathogens Infection in Burn Patients.', 'Clinical Challenges with Hypervirulent Klebsiella Pneumoniae (hvKP) in China.', 'The face of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples of two Iranian teaching hospitals.', 'Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae Causing Severe Infections in the Neuro-ICU.']"""

However, one area that remains understudied is persistent negative symptoms (PNS). Negative symptoms, including PNS, have been observed in those at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. The aim of this study was to determine if PNS were associated with functioning, neurocognition, and defeatist beliefs in a CHR sample.  Method:   CHR participants (n = 764) were recruited for the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study. Negative symptoms were rated on the Scale of Psychosis-risk Symptoms. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to examine changes over time between and within groups (PNS vs non-PNS).  Results:   The PNS group (n = 67) had significant deficits in functioning at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24-months compared to the non-PNS group (n = 673). Functioning improved over time in the non-PNS group, while functioning in the PNS group remained relatively stable and poor over a two-year period. A consistent trend emerged demonstrating higher defeatist beliefs in the PNS group; however, this result was lost when controlling for persistent depressive symptoms. There were no significant differences between the groups on neurocognition, social cognition, and transition to psychosis.  Conclusions:   PNS exist in youth at CHR for psychosis, resulting in significant and persistent functional impairment, which remains when controlling for persistent depressive symptoms. PNS remain even in CHR youth who do not transition to psychosis.

Additionally, mitochondrial diabetes may rarely present with diabetic ketoacidosis, and can be distinguished from other forms of monogenic diabetes including maturity onset diabetes of the young by the presence of multi-organ involvement, particularly pre-senile sensorineural hearing loss, maternal transmission, and later-onset diagnosis, typically affecting adults over 35 years. Various guidelines on diabetes care do not address this important subset of cases, and this diagnosis is easily missed.

Few longitudinal studies address how experiences of SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms in early young adulthood may contribute to poorer functioning in young adulthood. Using a sample of 2,416 youth aged 18 to 20 (Time 1), we assessed past year SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. One year later, when youth were between the ages of 20 and 22 (Time 2), participants indicated their functioning in four domains: physical health and sleep quality, substance use consequences, psychological functioning, and social functioning. Using latent class analyses, we found six participant classes at Time 1 based on SV experiences and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. Classes were variable by participants' reported degree of SV experiences and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptomology. Longitudinal analyses indicated that youth in a class that experienced high levels of both SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety at Time 1 generally reported the poorest functioning in all key domains at Time 2. However, classes where participants reported greater depression and anxiety symptoms-most often in the presence of, but at times in the absence of, SV-were consistently associated with poorer functioning for physical health, psychological functioning, and social health. Classes where participants reported greater SV-in the presence of, but at times in the absence of, depression and anxiety symptoms-were associated with greater alcohol and marijuana consequences.

As such, most ED research focuses on late adolescent and young adult females resulting in limited prospective research on gender differences in eating disorder psychopathology across the life span. The present study addresses this gap by examining gender differences in ED diagnoses, eating pathology, and the impact of putative risk factors on eating pathology in women (n = 624) and men (n = 276) over a 30-year period from late adolescence (M (SD) = 20[2] years) to later midlife (M (SD) = 50[2] years). Four assessment waves were conducted, beginning with baseline participation during college and subsequent 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up. Retention at 30-year follow-up was 72% (n = 440) for women and 67% (n = 181) for men. Prevalence of DSM-5 ED diagnoses decreased over the 30-year span for women and remained stable for men, with no significant gender difference in point prevalence by age 50. Drive for thinness decreased for women through age 50 and increased for men, while bulimic symptoms decreased as both genders aged. Multilevel models demonstrated that the impact of dieting as a risk factor on drive for thinness decreased prospectively as men aged and remained stable as women aged. Results imply that current risk models require refinement to account for developmental trajectories in which dramatic gender differences observed in late adolescence diminish over time.

We sought to determine whether the combination of a transvaginal Foley balloon plus misoprostol prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is superior to misoprostol alone in reducing the risk for CD.  Study design:   We undertook a multicenter, open-label, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial of nulliparous obese women with unfavorable cervix (Bishop's score ≤ 6) undergoing labor induction from January 2016 to June 2018 at three tertiary centers. Those at <32 weeks' gestation, premature rupture of membranes, stillbirth, and major fetal anomalies were excluded. Women were randomized 1:1 to either a combination of Foley balloon and misoprostol or misoprostol alone. Once Bishop's score was >6, further management was deferred to treating physicians. Primary outcome was the rate of CD. Secondary maternal outcomes included duration of induction-to-delivery interval, occurrence of tachysystole, clinical chorioamnionitis, need for operative vaginal delivery, as well as a composite of maternal morbidity (postpartum endometritis, surgical-site infection, venous thromboembolism, need for transfusion, intensive care unit admission, and maternal death). Secondary neonatal outcomes included need for neonatal intensive care unit admission, transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, culture-proven sepsis, neonatal seizures, and a composite of neonatal morbidity (Apgar's score ≤7 at 5 minutes, umbilical artery cord pH ≤7.10, birth injury, perinatal death). With the rate of CD rate being 53% at Children's Memorial Herman Hospital among nulliparous obese women who underwent induction of labor at ≥32 weeks and met our inclusion criteria; 250 women (125 women per group) were required to answer the study question. All analyses were by intention to treat.  Results:   Of the 236 women randomized, 113 (48%) were allocated to group 1 (combined Foley and PGE1) and 123 (52%) to group 2 (PGE1 alone). The rate of CD was similar between the groups (45 vs. 43%, p = 0.84, relative risk [RR]: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.75-1.42). There was no difference in the occurrence of tachysystole that resulted in fetal heart rate abnormalities between the groups (8.8 vs. 16.2%, p = 0.09, RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.27-1.11). The total duration of the induction-to-delivery interval was also similar between the groups (24.8 ± 13.8 vs. 24.5 ± 14.0 hours, p = 0.87) regardless of the mode of delivery. No differences were seen in the indications for CD and secondary maternal or neonatal outcomes.  Conclusion:   In this trial of nulliparous obese women undergoing labor induction, cervical ripening with combined Foley balloon and PGE1 resulted in similar CD rates than ripening with vaginal PGE1 alone.  Key points:   · Nulliparous obese women are at increased risk for cesarean delivery.. · Combined intravaginal misoprostol-Foley balloon versus misoprostol alone resulted in similar rates of cesarean delivery.. · Further research is warranted to determine the optimal cervical ripening strategy in this population..""","""['Oscar A Viteri', 'Kareem K Tabsh', 'Mesk A Alrais', 'Ximena C Salazar', 'Juan M Lopez', 'Randolph Y Fok', 'Suneet P Chauhan', 'Baha M Sibai']""","""[' Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Vermillion, South Dakota.', ' Avera Medical Group Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.', ' Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kern Medical Center, Bakersfield, California.', ' Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona.', ' Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UT Health), Houston, Texas.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Am J Perinatol""","""['Combination of Foley and prostaglandins versus Foley and oxytocin for cervical ripening: a network meta-analysis.', 'Combination of Foley bulb and vaginal misoprostol compared with vaginal misoprostol alone for cervical ripening and labor induction: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Misoprostol With Foley Bulb Compared With Misoprostol Alone for Cervical Ripening: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Maternal and neonatal outcomes with mechanical\xa0cervical dilation plus misoprostol compared\xa0to misoprostol alone for cervical ripening; a\xa0systematic review of literature and\xa0metaanalysis.', 'Nitric oxide donors for cervical ripening and induction of labour.', 'Mechanical methods for induction of labour.', 'Is Misoprostol Vaginal Insert Safe for the Induction of Labor in High-Risk Pregnancy Obese Women?', 'Mechanical methods for induction of labour.']"""

Furthermore, in patients suffering from HF, renal dysfunction accounts for as many as 30-60%. Accordingly, CRT may improve renal function inducing a systemic haemodynamic benefit leading to increased renal blood flow.  Objectives:   The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of renal function in response to resynchronisation therapy during a 12-month follow-up period.  Materials and methods:   The study consisted of 46 HF patients qualified for implantation of cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). A CRT responder is defined as a person without chronic HF exacerbations during observation whose physical efficiency has improved owing to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class improvement ≥1.  Results:   A statistically significant difference was noted between responders and non-responders regarding creatinine level at the 3rd month (p=0.04) and, particularly, at the 12th month (p=0.02) of follow-up (100±23 vs 139±78 μmol/l). Moreover, there was a remarkable difference between both study groups with regard to GFR CKD-EPI (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessed using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula) at the 6th (p=0.03) and 12th month (p=0.01) of follow-up. The reference values for initial creatinine concentrations (101 μmol/l) as well as GFR CKDEPI (63 ml/min/1.73m2) were empirically evaluated to predict favourable therapeutic CRT response.

Methods and results:   Rats were subjected to permanent ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery and randomized to receive subcutaneous implantation of TheraCyte devices containing either culture media as control or 1 × 106 human W8B2+ CSCs, immediately following myocardial ischaemia. At 4 weeks following myocardial infarction, rats treated with W8B2+ CSCs encapsulated within the TheraCyte device showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. The preservation of cardiac function was accompanied by reduced fibrotic scar tissue, interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as well as increased myocardial vascular density. Histological analysis of the TheraCyte devices harvested at 4 weeks post-implantation demonstrated survival of human W8B2+ CSCs within the devices, and the outer membrane was highly vascularized by host blood vessels. Using CSCs expressing plasma membrane reporters, extracellular vesicles of W8B2+ CSCs were found to be transferred to the heart and other organs at 4 weeks post-implantation. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling of extracellular vesicles of W8B2+ CSCs identified proteins implicated in inflammation, immunoregulation, cell survival, angiogenesis, as well as tissue remodelling and fibrosis that could mediate the cardioreparative effects of secretome of human W8B2+ CSCs.  Conclusions:   Subcutaneous implantation of TheraCyte devices encapsulating human W8B2+ CSCs attenuated adverse cardiac remodelling and preserved cardiac function following myocardial infarction.

Design, setting, and participants:   Youth aged 15.5 to 16.1 years at recruitment were eligible to participate. Participants' vehicles were instrumented with sensors, and driving was recorded during the learner period through 1 year of independent driving. Data were collected from January 2011 through August 2014 in southwestern Virginia.  Exposures:   The amount, consistency and variety of practice, driving errors, and kinematic risky driving (KRD) rates during the learner period were recorded. Surveys, including one on sensation-seeking personality traits, were assessed at baseline.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cox proportional hazard regressions examined associations between individual characteristics and learner driving experience with driving time to first crash and all crashes in the first year of independent driving. So that hazard ratios (HRs) can be directly comparable, units of measurement were standardized to the interquartile range.  Results:   Of 298 individuals who responded to recruitment, 90 fulfilled the criteria and 82 completed the study (of whom 75 were white [91%] and 44 were girls [54%]). Teenage participants drove a mean (SD) of 1259.2 (939.7) miles over 89 days during the learner period. There were 49 property-damage crashes and/or police-reportable crashes during independent driving. Factors associated with driving time to first crash included higher sensation-seeking personality scale scores (HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.08-2.57] per 0.75-unit increase), learner driving KRD rates (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.12-1.43] per 9.24-unit increase), and learner driving errors (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.22-0.86] per increase of 6.48 errors). Similar results were obtained for all crashes in the first year, with the addition of consistency of learner driving practice (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38-0.99] per 0.23-unit increase).  Conclusions and relevance:   Individual characteristics and learner driving experiences were associated with crash risk during independent driving. As expected, there was an association between sensation seeking and crashes. Elevated KRD rates during the learner period may reflect risky driving behavior among novices or tolerance to abrupt maneuvers by parents who supervise driving. Consistent practice throughout the learner period could reduce teenage crash risk, which is supported by learning theories indicating distributed practice is effective for developing expertise. Errors during practice may constitute learning events that reinforce safer driving. Physicians could encourage parents to provide opportunities for regular practice driving and monitor their teenager's KRD rates during the learner period using in-vehicle or smartphone-based technology.""","""['Johnathon P Ehsani', 'Pnina Gershon', 'Brydon J B Grant', 'Chunming Zhu', 'Sheila G Klauer', 'Tom A Dingus', 'Bruce G Simons-Morton']""","""[' Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Center for Injury Research and Policy, Department of Health Policy and Management, Baltimore, Maryland.', ' AgeLab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', ' Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Medicine, The University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York.', ' Health Behavior Branch, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland.', ' Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Blacksburg.']""","""2020""","""2020 Jun""","""JAMA Pediatr""","""['Public Policies Protect Young Drivers.', 'Public Policies Protect Young Drivers-Reply.', 'Crash Risk and Risky Driving Behavior Among Adolescents During Learner and Independent Driving Periods.', 'Naturalistic assessment of novice teenage crash experience.', 'Vehicle ownership and other predictors of teenagers risky driving behavior: Evidence from a naturalistic driving study.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Parenting and the young driver problem.']"""

An analysis of the global burden of disease study""","""Purpose:   Globally, years of life lost are declining, while years lived with disability are increasing. In high socio-demographic index countries, this trend has been attributed to an overall ageing population and rehabilitation services have begun to adjust to this change. In low- and middle-income countries, this trend is less well understood. Hence, the WHO's 'Rehabilitation 2030 Call for Action' and 'Rehabilitation in Health Systems Guide' call for better assessment of the situation. In order to understand trends and causes in middle income countries such as Botswana, we examine the change over time in causes and number of years lived with disability and years of life lost.  Methods:   We conducted a secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2017 data, exploring the change over time in Disability Adjusted Life Years per 100 000 people over the period 1990-2016. The descriptive analysis focuses on the contribution of years lived with disability towards the burden of disease within Botswana compared with the world, sub-Saharan Africa, and high-income countries.  Results:   Our results show that Botswana's top causes of years of life lost are HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, cardiovascular diseases, maternal and neonatal disorders, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and neoplasms. Years lived with disability have increased over time, which is driven by mental disorders, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.  Conclusions:   Botswana needs better data to prepare its emerging health systems to accommodate the increased need for disability support and rehabilitation services caused by communicable and non-communicable diseases.Implications for RehabilitationBotswana has an increase in disability prevalence over time that requires the development of disability and rehabilitation services.The greatest contributors towards disability adjusted life years in Botswana are currently mental disorders (13.7%), HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases, (13.0%), musculoskeletal disorders (9.9%), neurological disorders (8.0%), and sense organ diseases (6.2%).This requires strengthen of services such as mental health interventions, physiotherapy, optometry and audiology as well as linkages from major disease clusters such as HIV to rehabilitation services.""","""['Jill Hanass-Hancock', 'Bradley Carpenter']""","""[' South African Medical Research Council, Durban, South Africa.', ' School of Health Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Disabil Rehabil""","""['Disability, a priority area for health research in South Africa: an analysis of the burden of disease study 2017.', 'Global burden of 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.', 'Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.', 'National disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 257 diseases and injuries in Ethiopia, 1990-2015: findings from the global burden of disease study 2015.', 'Global mortality, disability, and the contribution of risk factors: Global Burden of Disease Study.']"""

This study examined hypotheses that among PWH, (1) higher cumulative burden of depression would relate to steeper declines in neurocognition, and (2) visit-to-visit depression severity would relate to fluctuations in neurocognition within persons.  Setting:   Data were collected at a university-based research center from 2002 to 2016.  Methods:   Participants included 448 PWH followed longitudinally. All participants had >1 visit (M = 4.97; SD = 3.53) capturing depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and neurocognition (comprehensive test battery). Cumulative burden of depression was calculated using an established method that derives weighted depression severity scores by time between visits and total time on study. Participants were categorized into low (67%), medium (15%), and high (18%) depression burden. Multilevel modeling examined between- and within-person associations between cumulative depression burden and neurocognition over time.  Results:   The high depression burden group demonstrated steeper global neurocognitive decline compared with the low depression burden group (b = -0.100, P = 0.001); this was driven by declines in executive functioning, delayed recall, and verbal fluency. Within-person results showed that compared with visits when participants reported minimal depressive symptoms, their neurocognition was worse when they reported mild (b = -0.12, P = 0.04) or moderate-to-severe (b = -0.15, P = 0.03) symptoms; this was driven by worsened motor skills and processing speed.  Conclusions:   High cumulative burden of depression is associated with worsening neurocognition among PWH, which may relate to poor HIV-related treatment outcomes.

It has been frequently noted that distinguishing BPD from bipolar disorder is challenging. Consequently, reviews and commentaries have focused on differential diagnosis and identifying clinical features to distinguish the two disorders. While there is a burgeoning literature comparing patients with BPD and bipolar disorder, much less research has characterized patients with both disorders. In the current report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compare psychiatric outpatients with both BPD and bipolar disorder to patients with BPD without bipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder without BPD.  Methods:   Psychiatric outpatients presenting for treatment were evaluated with semi-structured interviews. The focus of the current study is the 517 patients with both BPD and bipolar disorder (n = 59), BPD without bipolar disorder (n = 330), and bipolar disorder without BPD (n = 128).  Results:   Compared to patients with bipolar disorder, the patients with bipolar disorder and BPD had more comorbid disorders, psychopathology in their first-degree relatives, childhood trauma, suicidality, hospitalizations, time unemployed, and likelihood of receiving disability payments. The added presence of bipolar disorder in patients with BPD was associated with more posttraumatic stress disorder in the patients as well as their family, more bipolar disorder and substance use disorders in their relatives, more childhood trauma, unemployment, disability, suicide attempts, and hospitalizations.  Conclusions:   Patients with both bipolar disorder and BPD have more severe psychosocial morbidity than patients with only one of these disorders.""","""['Mark Zimmerman', 'Caroline Balling', 'Iwona Chelminski', 'Kristy Dalrymple']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Brown Medical School, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Psychol Med""","""['Comorbid bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and history of suicide attempts.', 'Distinguishing bipolar II depression from major depressive disorder with comorbid borderline personality disorder: demographic, clinical, and family history differences.', 'A comparison of depressed patients with and without borderline personality disorder: implications for interpreting studies of the validity of the bipolar spectrum.', 'The relationship between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder.', 'Problematic boundaries in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder: the interface with borderline personality disorder.', 'Psychotic spectrum features in borderline and bipolar disorders within the scope of the DSM-5 section III personality traits: a case control study.', 'Stress exposure and well-being: correlates of meeting criteria for bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, or both.']"""

Objective:   To analyze the correlations among symptom criteria for major depression with ADS and for mixed depression using a network analysis.  Methods:   Two hundred and forty-one outpatients with major depression were consecutively recruited. DSM-5 criteria for major depression with ADS or with mixed features (MF) and Koukopoulos' criteria for mixed depression (MXD) were assessed using a structured clinical interview.  Results:   A total of 58.9% of patients met DSM-5 criteria for major depression with ADS, 48.5% for MXD, and 2.5% for major depression with MF, so that the symptoms of this specifier were excluded from the network analysis. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating due to worries (57.7%), feeling keyed up or on edge (51%) (major depression with ADS), and psychic agitation or inner tension (51%) (MXD). Psychic agitation or inner tension had a central position in the network and bridged MXD to major depression with ADS through feeling keyed up or on edge.  Conclusions:   Criteria for major depression with ADS and for MXD are partially overlapping, with psychic agitation or inner tension and feeling keyed up or on edge that feature in both conditions and are difficult to distinguish in clinical practice.

Methods:   EMS providers transporting any injured child ≤15 years, regardless of severity, to a pediatric trauma center in 3 midsized communities over 3 years were interviewed. Data collected through the interview included EMS observed physiologic condition, suspected anatomic injuries, and mechanism. Patients were then followed to determine if they needed the resources of a trauma center by reviewing their medical record after hospital discharge. Patients were considered to need a trauma center if they received an intervention included in a previously published consensus definition. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics including positive likelihood ratios (+LR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).  Results:   9,483 provider interviews were conducted and linked to hospital outcome data. Of those, 230 (2.4%) met the consensus definition for needing a trauma center. 1,572 enrolled patients were excluded from further analysis because they met the Physiologic or Anatomic Criteria of the FTDS. Of the remaining 7,911 cases, 62 met the consensus definition for needing a trauma center (TC). Taken as a whole, the Mechanism of Injury Criteria of the FTDS identified 14 of the remaining 62 children who needed the resources of a trauma center for a 77% under-triage rate. The mechanisms sustained were 36% fall (16 needed TC), 28% motor vehicle crash (MVC) (20 needed TC), 7% struck by a vehicle (10 needed TC), <1% motorcycle crash (none needed TC), and 29% had a mechanism not included in the FTDS (16 needed TC). Of those who sustained a mechanisms not listed in the FTDS, the most common mechanisms were sport related injuries not including falls (24% of 2,283 cases with a mechanism not included) and assault (13%). Among those who fell from a height greater than 10 feet, 4 needed a TC (+LR 5.9; 95%CI 2.8-12.6). Among those in a MVC, 41 were reported to have been ejected and none needed a TC, while 31 had reported meeting the intrusion criteria and 0 needed a TC. There were 32 reported as having a death in the same vehicle, and 2 needed a TC (+LR 7.42; 95%CI: 1.90-29.0).  Conclusion:   Over a quarter of the children who needed the resources of a trauma center were not identified using the Physiologic or Anatomic Criteria of the Field Triage Decision Scheme. The Mechanism of Injury Criteria did not apply to over a quarter of the mechanisms experienced by children transported by EMS for injury. Use of the Mechanism Criteria did not greatly enhance identification of children who need a trauma center.

The study goal is to assess if these strategies are associated with lower cotinine values, an objective biological measure of TSE.  Methods:   Families admitted to Children's Hospital Colorado from 2014 to 2018 who screened positive for TSE were invited to participate in a tobacco smoking cessation/reduction program. Caregivers were consented and asked about demographics, beliefs around smoking, and strategies to reduce TSE. Child urine samples were collected, tested for cotinine levels, and analyzed using geometric means. Bivariable comparisons and multivariable linear regression were completed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Results:   Two hundred thirteen children (81.4%) are included in this analysis. The median ages of children and parents were 4 and 32 years respectively. Fifty-seven percent of children were male, 36% were Hispanic, and 55% were white. Fifty-six percent of parents had at least some college education and 69% had an annual income less than $50K. The median daily cigarettes smoked per day were 10. Eighty-eight percent reported using at least 1 type of protective measure to prevent TSE and 90% believed they protect other household members from TSE. None of the strategies had a significant relationship with lower cotinine levels on bivariable or multivariable analyses.  Conclusions:   Parental strategies to decrease TSE did not result in lower cotinine levels. Many measures are not evidence-based and do not protect children. Parent's clothing and homes may create a reservoir for nicotine.

In this study, we tested whether psychiatric polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improve clinically based classification models of BD v. MDD diagnosis.  Methods:   Our sample included 843 BD and 930 MDD subjects similarly genotyped and phenotyped using the same standardized interview. We performed multivariate modeling and receiver operating characteristic analysis, testing the incremental effect of PRSs on a baseline model with clinical symptoms and features known to associate with BD compared with MDD status.  Results:   We found a strong association between a BD diagnosis and PRSs drawn from BD (R2 = 3.5%, p = 4.94 × 10-12) and schizophrenia (R2 = 3.2%, p = 5.71 × 10-11) genome-wide association meta-analyses. Individuals with top decile BD PRS had a significantly increased risk for BD v. MDD compared with those in the lowest decile (odds ratio 3.39, confidence interval 2.19-5.25). PRSs discriminated BD v. MDD to a degree comparable with many individual symptoms and clinical features previously shown to associate with BD.

This study examined factors influencing linkage to care following home-based HIV-testing services (HBHTS) in a hyper-endemic setting in South Africa. HBHTS was offered to participants (N = 10,236) enrolled in the second HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System survey (2015-2016), KwaZulu-Natal. Follow-up telephone surveys with 196 of the 313 individuals diagnosed HIV-positive through HBHTS were used to measure linkage to care (i.e., a clinic visit within 12 weeks) and ART-initiation. Among newly diagnosed individuals (N = 183), 55% linked to care, and 21% of those who were ART-eligible started treatment within 12 weeks. Linkage to care was less likely among participants who had doubted their HIV-diagnosis (aOR:0.46, 95%CI: 0.23-0.93) and more likely among participants who had disclosed their HIV-status (aOR:2.31, 95%CI: 1.07-4.97). Reasons for not linking to care included no time (61%), only wanting to start treatment when sick (48%), fear of side-effects (33%), and not believing the HIV-diagnosis (16%). Results indicate that HBHTS needs to be paired with targeted interventions to facilitate early linkage to care. Interventions are required to counter denial of HIV status and facilitate early linkage to care among healthier individuals.""","""['Brendan Maughan-Brown', 'Sean Beckett', 'Ayesha B M Kharsany', 'Cherie Cawood', 'David Khanyile', 'Lara Lewis', 'Atheendar Venkataramani', 'Gavin George']""","""[' Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU), University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa.', ' Health Economics and HIV and AIDS Research Division (HEARD), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.', ' Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.', ' Epicentre Health Research, Cape Town, South Africa.', ' Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""AIDS Care""","""['High HIV testing uptake and linkage to care in a novel program of home-based HIV counseling and testing with facilitated referral in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.', 'Findings from home-based HIV testing and facilitated linkage after scale-up of test and treat in rural South Africa: young people still missing.', 'Uptake of Home-Based HIV Testing, Linkage to Care, and Community Attitudes about ART in Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Descriptive Results from the First Phase of the ANRS 12249 TasP Cluster-Randomised Trial.', 'Linkage to HIV care after home-based HIV counselling and testing in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.', ""A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for community-based HIV testing on men's engagement in the HIV care cascade."", 'Impact of short message service and peer navigation on linkage to care and antiretroviral therapy initiation in South Africa.']"""

Tackling the escalating burden of stroke in Africa requires prioritized, multipronged, and inter-sectoral strategies tailored to the unique African epidemiological, cultural, socioeconomic, and lifestyle landscape. The African Stroke Organization (ASO) is a new pan-African coalition that brings together stroke researchers, clinicians, and other health-care professionals with participation of national and regional stroke societies and stroke support organizations. With a vision to reduce the rapidly increasing burden of stroke in Africa, the ASO has a four-pronged focus on (1) research, (2) capacity building, (3) development of stroke services, and (4) collaboration with all stakeholders. This will be delivered through advocacy, awareness, and empowerment initiatives to bring about people-focused changes in policy, clinical practice, and public education.

We describe patterns of rheumatology/nephrology care and changes in healthcare use and medication adherence during transfer.  Methods:   We identified youth ages 15-25 with SLE using US private insurance claims from Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart. Rheumatology/nephrology visit patterns were categorized as (1) unilateral transfers to adult care within 12 months, (2) overlapping pediatric and adult visits, (3) lost to followup, or (4) continuing pediatric care. We used negative binomial regression and paired t tests to estimate changes in healthcare use and medication possession ratios (MPR) after the last pediatric (index) visit. We compared MPR between youth who transferred and age-matched peers continuing pediatric care.  Results:   Of the 184 youth transferred out of pediatric care, 41.8% transferred unilaterally, 31.5% had overlapping visits over a median of 12 months before final transfer, and 26.6% were lost to followup. We matched 107 youth continuing pediatric care. Overall, ambulatory care use decreased among those lost to followup. Acute care use decreased across all groups. MPR after the index date were lower in youth lost to followup (mean 0.24) compared to peers in pediatric care (mean 0.57, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Youth with SLE with continuous private insurance coverage do not use more acute care after transfer to adult care. However, a substantial proportion fail to see adult subspecialists within 12 months and have worse medication adherence, placing them at higher risk for adverse outcomes.""","""['Joyce C Chang', 'Andrea M Knight', 'Erica F Lawson']""","""["" J.C.

Methods:   To discover novel pancreatic cancer risk loci and possible causal genes, we performed a pancreatic cancer transcriptome-wide association study in Europeans using three approaches: FUSION, MetaXcan, and Summary-MulTiXcan. We integrated genome-wide association studies summary statistics from 9040 pancreatic cancer cases and 12 496 controls, with gene expression prediction models built using transcriptome data from histologically normal pancreatic tissue samples (NCI Laboratory of Translational Genomics [n = 95] and Genotype-Tissue Expression v7 [n = 174] datasets) and data from 48 different tissues (Genotype-Tissue Expression v7, n = 74-421 samples).  Results:   We identified 25 genes whose genetically predicted expression was statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk (false discovery rate < .05), including 14 candidate genes at 11 novel loci (1p36.12: CELA3B; 9q31.1: SMC2, SMC2-AS1; 10q23.31: RP11-80H5.9; 12q13.13: SMUG1; 14q32.33: BTBD6; 15q23: HEXA; 15q26.1: RCCD1; 17q12: PNMT, CDK12, PGAP3; 17q22: SUPT4H1; 18q11.22: RP11-888D10.3; and 19p13.11: PGPEP1) and 11 at six known risk loci (5p15.33: TERT, CLPTM1L, ZDHHC11B; 7p14.1: INHBA; 9q34.2: ABO; 13q12.2: PDX1; 13q22.1: KLF5; and 16q23.1: WDR59, CFDP1, BCAR1, TMEM170A).

Due to the paucity of cases described in the literature, its clinicopathological features, differential diagnosis, optimal therapy and outcomes are not well defined. As the clinical manifestations are often non-specific, it can create a diagnostic pitfall for the unwary physician. Preoperative distinction of adenocarcinoma and primary pancreatic lymphoma is critical since the management and prognosis of these malignancies are mutually exclusive. Due to its rarity, epidemiological studies have been difficult to conduct. Chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine) has proven to be effective. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old man with epigastric pain and obstructive jaundice. Further investigation with a CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a low attenuation mass in the head of the pancreas measuring 35×25 mm, suspicious for malignancy. The mass involved the common bile duct distally causing moderate retrograde intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree dilation of 14 mm. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, sphincterotomy and insertion of a stent. Core biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a high-grade B cell pancreas lymphoma. He started treatment with R-CHOP and prednisolone. Due to disease progression, he started treatment with DA-EPOCH-R (etoposide phosphate, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride and rituximab). There was no clinical response, and treatment with RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) was initiated.

Materials and methods:   The relationships between T-cell activation status (Activation, Intermediate, and Exhaustion), NSUN2 expression, and patient survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression models in a public dataset with 520 HNSCC patients. HPV status was determined based on a VirusScan analysis of RNA-seq data.  Results:   Among the patients with high NSUN2 expression, the Activation group exhibited longer survival than the Exhaustion group (trend P = 0.056). Adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.49-1.19) for the Intermediate vs Exhaustion, and 0.61 (0.36-1.03) for Activation vs. Exhaustion. In contrast, there is a positive association between T-cell activation score and mortality in the patients with low NSUN2 expression (trend P = 0.016). The adjusted HRs were 1.97 (1.12-3.47) for the Intermediate vs Exhaustion, and 2.06 (1.16-3.68) for the Activation vs Exhaustion. In multivariate cox models with or without HPV status, the interaction between T-cell activation status and NSUN2 expression was statistically significant (P = 0.004 for with HPV status, and P = 0.002 for without, respectively). When not controlling for NSUN2 expression, there was no significant association between T-cell activation score and patient mortality (P = 0.84).  Conclusions:   An interaction between NSUN2 expression and T-cell activation status affects patient survival in HNSCC regardless of HPV status, suggesting that NSUN2 is a potential precision marker for immune-checkpoint blockade, and a potential therapeutic target.""","""['Lingeng Lu', 'Stephen G Gaffney', 'Vincent L Cannataro', 'Jeffrey Townsend']""","""[' Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Data Science, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT 06520-8034, USA.

We aimed to test the effects of talc vs. control particles on the ability of prototypical macrophage cell lines to curb the growth of ovarian cancer cells in culture in the presence of estrogen. We found that murine ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSEC), a prototype of certain forms of ovarian cancer, were present in larger numbers after co-culture with macrophages treated to a combination of talc and estradiol than to either agent alone or vehicle. Control particles (titanium dioxide, concentrated urban air particulates or diesel exhaust particles) did not have this effect. Co-exposure of macrophages to talc and estradiol has led to increased production of reactive oxygen species and changes in expression of macrophage genes pertinent in cancer development and immunosurveillance. These findings suggest that in vitro exposure to talc, particularly in a high-estrogen environment, may compromise immunosurveillance functions of macrophages and prompt further studies to elucidate this mechanism.""","""['Angelo Mandarino', 'David J Gregory', 'Connor C McGuire', 'Brian W Leblanc', 'Hadley Witt', 'Loreilys Mejias Rivera', 'John J Godleski', 'Alexey V Fedulov']""","""[' Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Research, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', ' Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Boston, MA, USA.', ' University of Rochester Medical Center, Department of Environmental Medicine, Rochester, NY, USA.', ' John J.

Needle-and-syringe coverage increased from 193 to 291 per PWID, and OAT coverage increased from 55 to 66 per 100 PWID over the study period.Conclusions. While the number of PWID increased between 2011 and 2016, OAT coverage remained high, and needle-and-syringe coverage generally improved over time.Public Health Implications. These data will inform public health surveillance, service planning, and resource allocation, and assist monitoring of treatment and harm-reduction coverage outcomes.""","""['Brendan Jacka', 'Sarah Larney', 'Louisa Degenhardt', 'Naveed Janjua', 'Stine Høj', 'Mel Krajden', 'Jason Grebely', 'Julie Bruneau']""","""["" Brendan Jacka, Stine Hoj, and Julie Bruneau are with Research Center of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec.

Results: Lifetime diagnosis of concussion was associated with greater odds of past 30-day/2-week substance use. Adolescents who indicated multiple diagnosed concussions (versus none) had two times greater odds of all types of recent substance use, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Adolescents indicating multiple diagnosed concussions also had higher adjusted odds of cigarette use, binge drinking, and marijuana use) when compared to adolescents who only indicated one diagnosed concussion. Accounting for adolescents' propensity toward sensation-seeking did not significantly change the association between substance use and multiple diagnosed concussions. Conclusions: This study provides needed epidemiological data regarding concussion and substance use among US adolescents. Exposure to a single diagnosed concussion is associated with a modest increase in the risk of substance use and this association increases with the accumulation of multiple diagnosed concussions. These associations hold when controlling for sensation-seeking.

Although patient involvement in decision making varies widely, most patients desire to share in decision making. The Press-Ganey Patient Satisfaction survey includes questions that measure patients' perceptions of their providers' efforts to involve them in decision making (PGDM). We hypothesized that higher PGDM scores would correlate with higher scores on a validated measure of patient centeredness.  Materials and methods:   Surgical providers at a university hospital who routinely receive Press-Ganey scores received a survey that included the Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS), a validated tool that measures the provider's orientation toward patient centeredness on a continuous six-point scale: score ≥5 = high, 4.57-5 = moderate, and <4.57 = low and includes nine-item ""caring"" or ""sharing"" subscales. We compared PPOS scores to PGDM scores, averaged from April 2015 to January 2016.  Results:   Eighty-six of 112 (75%) of surgical providers responded to the survey. Fifty-two (46%) had PGDM scores available and 26% achieved a perfect score on the PGDM. The overall PPOS scores were low, with a mean of 4.2 (SD = 0.5). The PPOS was not correlated with the PGDM, correlation coefficient (rs) = -0.07 (CI: -0.34-0.21, P = 0.63). Similarly, the two subscales of the PPOS did not correlate with the PGDM with rs = -0.15 (CI: -0.41-0.13, P = 0.29) for ""caring"" and rs = -0.04 (CI: -0.31-0.23, P = 0.76) for ""sharing"".  Conclusions:   Although surgical providers scored low in patient centeredness using the PPOS, over one-quarter (26%) of them rank in the top 1% on the PGDM.

Out of the four different types of HTLVs, HTLV-1 is most prominent in scourging over 20 million people around the world and still not much effort has been made in understanding the epidemiology and controlling the prevalence of this virus. This condition further worsens when most of the infected cases remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime due to the limited diagnostic methods; that are most of the times unavailable for timely detection of infected individuals. Moreover, at present, there is no licensed vaccination for HTLV-1 infection. Therefore, there is a need to develop the faster and efficient diagnostic method for the detection of HTLV-1. Influenced from the outcomes of the machine learning techniques in the field of bio-informatics, this is the first study in which 64 hybrid machine learning techniques have been proposed for the prediction of different type of HTLVs (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3). The hybrid techniques are built by permutation and combination of four classification methods, four feature weighting, and four feature selection techniques. The proposed hybrid models when evaluated on the basis of various model evaluation parameters are found to be capable of efficiently predicting the type of HTLVs. The best hybrid model has been identified by having accuracy, an AUROC value, and F1 score of 99.85 percent, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. This kind of the system can assist the current diagnostic system for the detection of HTLV-1 as after the molecular diagnostics of HTLV by various screening tests like enzyme-linked immunoassay or particle agglutination assays there is always a need of confirmatory tests like western blotting, immuno-fluorescence assay, or radio-immuno-precipitation assay for distinguishing HTLV-1 from HTLV-2. These confirmatory tests are indeed very complex analytical techniques involving various steps. The proposed hybrid techniques can be used to support and verify the results of confirmatory test from the protein mixture. Furthermore, better insights about the virus can be obtained by exploring the physicochemical properties of the protein sequences of HTLVs.""","""['Gaurav Sharma', 'Prashant Singh Rana', 'Seema Bawa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform""","""['Serological and Molecular Methods to Study Epidemiological Aspects of Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 Infection.', 'Tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy: clinical, epidemiological, virological and therapeutic aspects.', 'Incidence of human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis in a long-term prospective cohort study of initially asymptomatic individuals in Brazil.', 'Balance Impairments in Patients with Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 Infection.', 'Current approaches for detection of human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1: A systematic review.', 'CD8TCEI-EukPath: A Novel Predictor to Rapidly Identify CD8+ T-Cell Epitopes of Eukaryotic Pathogens Using a Hybrid Feature Selection Approach.']"""

To identify variables that help to predict risk of tumor recurrence, progression, and CSM. Materials and Methods: A prospective study of 251 consecutive patients with 399 recurrent NMIBC who underwent outpatient Holmium yttrium aluminium garnet laser ablation under topical anesthesia was carried out between September 2006 and September 2018. All patients underwent primary transurethral resection of bladder tumor to obtain histology. All patients completed a patient satisfaction questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) for procedure-related pain. Results: All 251 patients were analyzed with an average age of 75.2 years and follow-up of 69.8 months. The majority of patients had multiple comorbidities with an American Society of Anesthesiologists of 3 or 4. The proportion of tumor grade 1, 2, and 3 disease and tumor stage Ta and T1 was 43.4%, 41.5%, 15.1%, 78.5%, and 21.5%, respectively. Overall, 57.8% of patients had at least one tumor recurrence with an average time of 16.3 months. Risk factors were tumor grade, number of tumors at time of first laser ablation, and tumor stage. Overall, 19.1% of patients demonstrated tumor progression with an average time of 51 months. Only 5.6% of patients had progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the CSM rate was 5.2% with an average time to death of 71.2 months. Risk factors for CSM were tumor grade, stage, and the patient's age. The average VAS for pain was 0.6 out of 10, with all patients willing to have the procedure repeated if required. Conclusion: Laser ablation of NMIBC is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated long-term option for patients, particular in those who have moderate-to-severe co-morbidities.

We examined the association of animal and plant protein intake with the risk of incident kidney stones in Shanghai, China.  Materials and methods:   Dietary intakes were obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Self-reported stone events were ascertained at baseline and at followup visits. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations of protein intake with the incident stone risk.  Results:   During 319,211 and 696,950 person-years of followup 1,451 men and 1,202 women, respectively, reported incident stones. The average ± SD intake of animal and plant protein standardized to 2,000 kcal was 31.3 ± 13.7 and 48.4 ± 7.2 gm per day in women, and 30.8 ± 13.3 and 51.3 ± 7.6 gm per day, respectively, in men. On multivariable analysis participants in the highest quintiles of animal and nondairy animal protein intake showed an increased risk of incident stones compared to those in the lowest quintiles (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.32, p=0.03 vs HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.30, p=0.04).

We examined these relations using the Communal Extraversion (e.g., enjoy spending time with people, would describe myself as cheerful, like places that are crowded and exciting) and Agentic Extraversion (e.g., speak my mind, take charge in a group of people, like the sensation of going really fast) scales from the Faceted Inventory of the Five-Factor Model (FI-FFM; Watson, Nus, & Wu, 2019). As expected, Communal Extraversion generally showed negative associations with psychopathology; it had particularly strong links to indicators of internalizing, including depression symptoms (correlations generally ranged from -.40 to -.60) and various forms of social dysfunction (most correlations ranged from -.35 to -.60). In marked contrast, Agentic Extraversion tended to have positive associations with psychopathology; it displayed particularly substantial links to indicators of mania, narcissism/narcissistic personality disorder, and traits related to externalizing (correlations generally ranged from .25 to .50). Regression results demonstrated that aspect-level analyses generated substantial increases in predictive power over the FI-FFM Extraversion domain score. This basic pattern of results replicated over time, across gender, and across both self-rated and interview-based indicators of psychopathology. These findings establish the value of examining relations with extraversion at the aspect level.

In an adolescent genetic epidemiological sample (ages 15-21), the present study (N = 848, 56.97% female) examined concurrent associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress) at baseline and prospective, predictive associations of baseline distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology at 2-year follow-up. In addition, the present study assessed distress tolerance with two laboratory-based tasks, a carbon dioxide challenge and the mirror-tracing task, to distinguish between tolerance of physiological and cognitive distress, respectively. Elevated anxiety sensitivity was broadly associated with elevated symptoms of internalizing psychopathology at baseline and prospectively predicted elevated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 2-year follow-up. Higher tolerance of cognitive distress was associated with lower concurrent anxiety symptoms but not with anxiety symptoms at follow-up. The present results clarify previously mixed findings; during adolescence, anxiety sensitivity showed broad concurrent and prospective associations with internalizing disorder risk whereas distress tolerance, specifically regarding cognitive distress, was associated with only elevated concurrent anxiety symptoms.""","""['Jun Qi', 'Lance M Rappaport', 'Jennifer Cecilione', 'John M Hettema', 'Roxann Roberson-Nay']""","""[' Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University.', ' Department of Psychology, University of Windsor.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol""","""['Distress Tolerance as a Mechanism Linking Violence Exposure to Problematic Alcohol use in Adolescence.', 'Clinical Correlates of Carbon Dioxide Hypersensitivity in Children.', 'Reciprocal relations between internalizing symptoms and frequency of alcohol use: Findings from a longitudinal study of Mexican-origin youth.', 'Sleep to Internalizing Pathway in Young Adolescents (SIPYA): A proposed neurodevelopmental model.', 'Understanding comorbidity among internalizing problems: Integrating latent structural models of psychopathology and risk mechanisms.', 'The potential mediating role of anxiety sensitivity in the impact of mindfulness training on anxiety and depression severity and impairment: A randomized controlled trial.', 'Anxiety sensitivity in relation to cigarette smoking and other substance use in African American smokers.']"""

These results were also observed in myeloid-specific Tshr-deficient ApoE -/- mice, which indicated macrophages to be a critical target of the proinflammatory and atherogenic effects of TSH. In vitro experiments further revealed that TSH activated MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38α, and JNK) and IκB/p65 pathways in macrophages and increased inflammatory cytokine production and their recruitment of monocytes.

Methods: State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD) files for California, Florida, and New Jersey were queried for patients who underwent OCTR and ECTR between 2000 and 2014. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and cost were compared between OCTR and ECTR. The frequency of each procedure was used to formulate trends in OCTR and ECTR. Results: A total of 571 403 patients were included in this study. Sex was significantly different by a small percentage (OCTR = 64.8% female, ECTR = 65.4% female). A higher proportion of Hispanic patients underwent ECTR (P < .001). The patients who underwent OCTR had a greater comorbidity burden in terms of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis (P < .001). None of the aforementioned complication rates were statistically significant between the 2 procedures. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release was significantly more costly by almost $2000. Open carpal tunnel release has remained stable over the years studied, whereas ECTR increased 3-fold.

Obstetric, medical, demographic, and hospital factors including PPH during the index delivery were analyzed. Sixty-day postpartum readmission for PPH was the primary outcome. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed. In adjusted models, the risk was characterized as adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). As a secondary outcome to further characterize how PPH at delivery was associated with readmission likelihood, the risk for all-cause readmission was evaluated among women with this diagnosis during their delivery.Results: Of the 15,701,150 delivery hospitalizations, 10,618 women were readmitted postpartum for a primary indication of postpartum hemorrhage. Eighty-two percent of readmissions occurred ≤20 days after discharge. In the adjusted model for readmission for PPH, PPH during the delivery hospitalization was associated with aRR of 5.26 (95% CI 4.94, 5.59) for hemorrhage alone, aRR of 14.28 (95% CI 13.06, 15.60) for hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and aRR of 12.40 for PPH with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) requiring transfusion (95% CI 9.56-16.08) compared to no PPH. For the secondary analysis evaluating all-cause readmission, PPH during delivery was associated with aRR of 1.47 for PPH alone (95% CI 1.44-1.51), aRR of 2.43 for PPH requiring transfusion (95% CI 2.34-2.52), and aRR of 2.77 for PPH with DIC requiring transfusion (95% CI 2.54-3.03) compared to no PPH.Conclusion: PPH at delivery is a significant risk factor for subsequent readmission both for PPH and for all causes.

MeN primarily affects young adults without traditional CKD risk factors, and agricultural workers are disproportionately afflicted. We previously identified an acute phase of MeN that involves acute kidney injury (AKI) with tubulointerstitial nephritis and systemic inflammation. Because clinical disease progression in MeN is not yet understood, we sought to determine clinical predictors for progression from acute MeN to CKD. Through ongoing surveillance in Nicaragua, local physicians reported cases of acute MeN and CKD among agricultural workers. We analyzed clinical data collected during the acute MeN encounter to identify factors associated with progression to CKD. From February 2015 to May 2017, 586 agricultural workers (median age 27.8 years, 90% male) presented with acute MeN. The majority had a normal baseline creatinine, and leukocyturia (98.8%) and peripheral leukocytosis (80.7%) were common. Ultimately, 49 (8.4%) progressed to CKD, the majority of those within 6 months. CKD was attributed to MeN in all cases, and none had diabetes or hypertension. The strongest predictors of CKD progression were anemia and paresthesias at presentation, while leukocytosis was associated with renal recovery. Clinical markers of acute MeN may help clinicians identify patients at high risk for rapid progression to CKD, which in turn can inform early clinical management. Future studies should seek to determine the underlying etiology of disease and identify optimal interventions to interrupt the pathophysiologic process of MeN.""","""['Rebecca S B Fischer', 'Chandan Vangala', 'Sreedhar Mandayam', 'Denis Chavarria', 'Ramón García-Trabanino', 'Felix Garcia', 'Linda L Garcia', 'Kristy O Murray']""","""["" Section of Pediatric Tropical Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, National School of Tropical Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", ' Section of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ' Gerencia de Salud Ocupacional, Ingenio San Antonio, Chichigalpa, Nicaragua.', ' Centro de Hemodiálisis, San Salvador, El Salvador; Fondo Social de Emergencia para la Salud, Centro Monseñor Oscar Arnulfo Romero, Cantón Tierra Blanca, El Salvador.', ' Hospital Alfredo Pellas Chamorro, Chichigalpa, Nicaragua.', "" Section of Pediatric Tropical Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, National School of Tropical Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.

We investigated whether the prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid in addition to prophylactic oxytocin in women with vaginal delivery would decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage.  Methods:   In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned women in labor who had a planned vaginal delivery of a singleton live fetus at 35 or more weeks of gestation to receive 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo, administered intravenously, in addition to prophylactic oxytocin after delivery. The primary outcome was postpartum hemorrhage, defined as blood loss of at least 500 ml, measured with a collector bag.  Results:   Of the 4079 women who underwent randomization, 3891 had a vaginal delivery. The primary outcome occurred in 156 of 1921 women (8.1%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 188 of 1918 (9.8%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.01; P=0.07). Women in the tranexamic acid group had a lower rate of provider-assessed clinically significant postpartum hemorrhage than those in the placebo group (7.8% vs. 10.4%; relative risk, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91; P=0.004; P=0.04 after adjustment for multiple comparisons post hoc) and also received additional uterotonic agents less often (7.2% vs. 9.7%; relative risk, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.92; P=0.006; adjusted P=0.04). Other secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. The incidence of thromboembolic events in the 3 months after delivery did not differ significantly between the tranexamic acid group and the placebo group (0.1% and 0.2%, respectively; relative risk, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.24).  Conclusions:   Among women with vaginal delivery who received prophylactic oxytocin, the use of tranexamic acid did not result in a rate of postpartum hemorrhage of at least 500 ml that was significantly lower than the rate with placebo.

Using detailed location data on maternal addresses and GIS coordinates of gas wells, this study examines singleton births to mothers residing close to a shale gas well from 2003 to 2010 in Pennsylvania. The introduction of drilling increased low birth weight and decreased term birth weight on average among mothers living within 2.5 km of a well compared to mothers living within 2.5 km of a permitted well. Adverse effects were also detected using measures such as small for gestational age and APGAR scores, while no effects on gestation periods were found. In the intensive margin, an additional well is associated with a 7 percent increase in low birth weight, a 5 g reduction in term birth weight and a 3 percent increase in premature birth.

This is partially due to a lack of reliable and sensitive protocols for studying viral diversity and to the highly complex analysis required for NGS data processing. One important step towards this goal is finding methods that can efficiently concentrate viruses from sewage samples. Here the application of a virus concentration method based on skimmed milk organic flocculation (SMF) using 10L of sewage collected in different seasons enabled the detection of many viruses. However, some viruses, such as human adenoviruses, could not always be detected using metagenomics, even when quantitative PCR (qPCR) assessments were positive. A targeted metagenomic assay for adenoviruses was conducted and 59.41% of the obtained reads were assigned to murine adenoviruses. However, up to 20 different human adenoviruses (HAdV) were detected by this targeted assay being the most abundant HAdV-41 (29.24%) and HAdV-51 (1.63%). To improve metagenomics' sensitivity, two different protocols for virus concentration were comparatively analysed: an ultracentrifugation protocol and a lower-volume SMF protocol. The sewage virome contained 41 viral families, including pathogenic viral species from families Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Papillomaviridae and Hepeviridae. The contribution of urine to sewage metavirome seems to be restricted to a few specific DNA viral families, including the polyomavirus and papillomavirus species. In experimental infections with sewage in a rhesus macaque model, infective human hepatitis E and JC polyomavirus were identified. Urban raw sewage consists of the excreta of thousands of inhabitants; therefore, it is a representative sample for epidemiological surveillance purposes. The knowledge of the metavirome is of significance to public health, highlighting the presence of viral strains that are circulating within a population while acting as a complex matrix for viral discovery.""","""['X Fernandez-Cassi', 'N Timoneda', 'S Martínez-Puchol', 'M Rusiñol', 'J Rodriguez-Manzano', 'N Figuerola', 'S Bofill-Mas', 'J F Abril', 'R Girones']""","""[' Department of Genetics, Microbiology and Statistics, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

There is only limited awareness and understanding of the pathologic correlates of this condition, mostly from Japan; this entity is largely unrecognized in the West. In this study, 76 gallbladders from patients with PBM (64 from Japan; 12 from the United States) were analyzed and contrasted with 66 from non-PBM patients. These were predominantly females (54 vs. 22), mean age, 53 (range: 14 to 81). Cholelithiasis was uncommon (16% vs. 80% in non-PBM, P<0.01) whereas cholesterolosis was more common (49% vs. 29%, P=0.02) suggesting an altered chemical milieu. There was a distinctive diffuse mucosal hyperplasia (82% vs. 42%, P<0.01) with markedly elongated folds (mean: 1.1 vs. 0.7 mm, P<0.01) composed of compact villoglandular proliferation, often showing broad-based pushing into muscle, accompanied by prominent and more complex Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus formation (2.0 vs. 1.0/cm, P<0.01) at the base. At the tips, this villiform hyperplasia displayed frequent horizontal bridging of the folds (68% vs. 47%, P=0.01), bulbous dilatation (52% vs. 21%, P<0.01) as well as deposition of a peculiar amyloid-like hyaline material (56% vs. 15%, P<0.01). Despite paucity of inflammation and gallstones, findings attributed to mucosal injury were common including: pyloric gland metaplasia (70% vs. 48%, P=0.01) and intestinal metaplasia (24% vs. 6%, P<0.01). Invasive gallbladder carcinoma was present in 22 (29%) of the cases with 6 of these (27%) arising in association with intracholecystic papillary tubular neoplasm. Five cases had bile duct carcinoma at the time of cholecystectomy and 1 developed it 4 years after. In conclusion, gallbladders with patients with PBM display a distinctive pattern of mucosal hyperplasia with distinguishing features, which in constellation render it a microscopically diagnosable specific entity. We propose to refer to this entity as ""reflux-associated cholecystopathy."" Recognition of the pathologic characteristics of this entity is important so that investigation for, as well as treatment and prevention of, PBM-associated complications (biliary tract cancers and pancreatitis) can be instituted.

We investigated whether HIV antibody responses as measured by high-throughput quantitative and qualitative assays could be used to indirectly measure persistent HIV replication in individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Methods:   HIV antibody responses were measured over time in the presence or absence of suppressive ART and were compared to the HIV reservoir size and expression of antiviral restriction factors.  Results:   Among untreated individuals, including both elite controllers (ie, persons with a viral load of ≤40 copies/mL) and noncontrollers, antibody parameters were stable over time and correlated with the individual viral load. Viral suppression with ART led to a progressive decline in antibody responses after treatment induction that persisted for 5-7 years. Higher levels of HIV antibodies during suppressive therapy were associated with later initiation of ART after infection, with higher DNA and cell-associated RNA levels, and with lower expression of multiple anti-HIV host restriction factors.  Discussion:   These findings suggest that declining antibody levels during ART reflect lower levels of antigen production and/or viral replication in the persistent HIV reservoir.

Systemic cytokine responses may differentiate ECs from subjects with uncontrolled viral replication or from those who require ART to suppress viral replication. We measured 87 cytokines in four groups of women: 73 ECs, 42 with pharmacologically suppressed viremia (ART), 42 with uncontrolled viral replication (noncontrollers [NCs]), and 48 HIV-uninfected (NEG) subjects. Four cytokines were elevated in ECs but not NCs or ART subjects: CCL14, CCL21, CCL27, and XCL1. In addition, median stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) levels were 43% higher in ECs than in NCs. The combination of the five cytokines suppressed R5 and X4 virus replication in resting CD4+ T cells, and individually SDF-1β, CCL14, and CCL27 suppressed R5 virus replication, while SDF-1β, CCL21, and CCL14 suppressed X4 virus replication. Functional studies revealed that the combination of the five cytokines upregulated CD69 and CCR5 and downregulated CXCR4 and CCR7 on CD4+ T cells. The CD69 and CXCR4 effects were driven by SDF-1, while CCL21 downregulated CCR7. The combination of the EC-associated cytokines induced expression of the anti-HIV host restriction factors IFITM1 and IFITM2 and suppressed expression of RNase L and SAMHD1. These results identify a set of cytokines that are elevated in ECs and define their effects on cellular activation, HIV coreceptor expression, and innate restriction factor expression. This cytokine pattern may be a signature characteristic of HIV-1 elite control, potentially important for HIV therapeutic and curative strategies.IMPORTANCE Approximately 1% of people infected with HIV control virus replication without taking antiviral medications. These subjects, termed elite controllers (ECs), are known to have stronger immune responses targeting HIV than the typical HIV-infected subject, but the exact mechanisms of how their immune responses control infection are not known. In this study, we identified five soluble immune signaling molecules (cytokines) in the blood that were higher in ECs than in subjects with typical chronic HIV infection.

Furthermore, these five EC-associated cytokines could change expression levels of intrinsic resistance factors, or molecules inside the target cell that fight HIV infection.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a short in-class LD education program based on social learning theory and the Health Belief Model (HBM) impacted a child's knowledge, attitude, and preventive behavior.  Methods:   Students in grades 2-5 in 19 elementary schools were selected in an area that was highly endemic for LD. The children received an educational intervention or were on a wait list as controls. Their knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported preventive behaviors were surveyed before implementing the program and 1 year later. General linear regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, and baseline variables were used to measure the impact of the intervention.  Results:   There were 3570 participants in the study: 1562 received the intervention, and 2008 were controls. The mean age for both groups was 9.1 years, with 53% women in the intervention group and 50% women in the control group. The children in the intervention group increased their overall knowledge of LD more than the children in the control group (overall knowledge score improvement, mean difference (SD) 1.38 (1.3) vs. 0.36 (1.3) p < 0.0001). All children in classes receiving the intervention reported an increase in precautionary behavior, positive attitude toward taking precautions, and self-efficacy compared with the wait list controls. Two LD cases were confirmed during the follow-up period, one in the intervention group and one in the controls.  Conclusions:   These findings demonstrate that a short in-class educational program that includes elements of the HBM, including: (1) awareness and knowledge about the disease, (2) benefits of preventive behavior, and (3) confidence in ability to perform preventive behaviors can improve knowledge, attitude, and self-reported precautionary behavior among at-risk children. www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT00594997.""","""['Nancy A Shadick', 'Melanie J Zibit', 'Elizabeth Nardone', 'Alfred DeMaria Jr', 'Christine K Iannaccone', 'Jing Cui']""","""["" 1 Division of Rheumatology, Immunology & Allergy, Brigham & Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ' 2 Advocates, Inc. , Framingham, Massachusetts.', ' 3 Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences , Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.']""","""2016""","""2016 Aug""","""Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis""","""['Education on tick bite and Lyme borreliosis prevention, aimed at schoolchildren in the Netherlands: comparing the effects of an online educational video game versus a leaflet or no intervention.', 'Preventive behaviors and knowledge of tick-borne illnesses: results of a survey from an endemic area.', 'Experience of Lyme disease and preferences for precautions: a cross-sectional survey of UK patients.', 'Tick-borne disease preventive practices and perceptions in an endemic area.', 'Determinants of tick-avoidance behaviors in an endemic area for Lyme disease.', 'Behavioral risk factors associated with reported tick exposure in a Lyme disease high incidence region in Canada.', 'Interventions to prevent Lyme disease in humans: A systematic review.', 'Education on tick bite and Lyme borreliosis prevention, aimed at schoolchildren in the Netherlands: comparing the effects of an online educational video game versus a leaflet or no intervention.']"""

Although nuclear factor-κB is activated in cells from patients with inflammatory diseases or cancer, little is known about its roles in the development and progression of esophageal diseases. We investigated whether mice that express an activated form of IKKβ in the esophageal epithelia develop esophageal disorders.  Methods:   We generated ED-L2-Cre/Rosa26-IKK2caSFL mice, in which the ED-L2 promoter activates expression of Cre in the esophageal epithelia, leading to expression of a constitutively active form of IKKβ (IKKβca) in epithelial cells but not in inflammatory cells or the surrounding stroma (IKKβca mice). Mice lacking the Cre transgene served as controls. Some mice were given intraperitoneal injections of neutralizing antibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or immunoglobulin G1 (control), starting at 1 month of age. Epithelial tissues were collected and analyzed by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Transgenes were overexpressed from retroviral vectors in primary human keratinocytes.  Results:   IKKβca mice developed esophagitis and had increased numbers of blood vessels in the esophageal stroma, compared with controls. Esophageal tissues from IKKβca mice had increased levels of GM-CSF. Expression of IKKβca in primary human esophageal keratinocytes led to 11-fold overexpression of GM-CSF and 200-fold overexpression of TNF. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with conditioned media from these keratinocytes increased endothelial cell migration by 42% and promoted formation of capillary tubes; these effects were blocked by a neutralizing antibody against GM-CSF. Injections of anti-GM-CSF reduced angiogenesis and numbers of CD31+ blood vessels in esophageal tissues of IKKβca mice, but did not alter the esophageal vasculature of control mice and did not alter recruitment of intraepithelial leukocytes to esophageal tissues of IKKβca mice. Injections of anti-TNF prevented the development of esophagitis in IKKβca mice.  Conclusions:   Constitutive activation of IKKβ in the esophageal epithelia of mice leads to inflammation and angiogenesis, mediated by TNF and GM-CSF, respectively.""","""['Marie-Pier Tétreault', 'Daniel Weinblatt', 'Jody Dyan Ciolino', 'Andres J Klein-Szanto', 'Bridget K Sackey', 'Christina Twyman-Saint Victor', 'Tatiana Karakasheva', 'Valerie Teal', 'Jonathan P Katz']""","""[' Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.

Methods and results:   A microsimulation model evaluating lifelong cost-effectiveness for individuals aged 40-85 at intermediate risk of CVD, using 2003-2004 NHANES-III (N=3736), Framingham Heart Study, U.S. Vital Statistics, meta-analyses of independent predictive effects of the four novel risk markers and treatment effects was constructed. Using both an intention-to-treat (assumes adherence <100% and incorporates disutility from taking daily medications) and an as-treated (100% adherence and no disutility) analysis, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (2014 US $), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER in $/QALY gained) of screening with hsCRP, CT coronary calcium, cIMT and ABI were established compared with current practice, full adherence to current guidelines, and ubiquitous statin therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis in men, screening with CT calcium was cost effective ($32,900/QALY) compared with current practice. In women, screening with hsCRP was cost effective ($32,467/QALY). In the as-treated analysis, statin therapy was both more effective and less costly than all other strategies for both men and women.  Conclusions:   When a substantial disutility from taking daily medication is assumed, screening men with CT coronary calcium is likely to be cost-effective whereas screening with hsCRP has value in women.

The aims of this study were to characterize STF injuries and to identify floor-related safety problems that can be reduced or eliminated through building design. Our material consisted of Finnish agricultural injury claim records for the period 1992-2002. The material included 6,414 slip, trip, and fall injuries that occurred in dairy, beef and swine production and were caused by floor structures. We examined coded information and injury descriptions to identify causes and contributing factors. The performance approach (PA) was used as a framework for discussing findings and their application to building design. PA provides a logic model for building design that considers the needs of workers, animals, and production processes. Nearly half (42%) of agricultural injuries occurred in dairy, beef, and swine production work. Fourteen percent of these injuries were slips, trips, and falls (STF) related to floor structures. More than 450 work years were lost due to disability resulting from these injuries. Many STF injuries occurred in milking (n = 1135), moving feeds (n = 962), and animal transport and care (n = 880). More than half (59%) of STF injuries occurred while carrying or moving a load. STF injury causes included floors, door sills, gutters, curbs, steps, ramps, grates, and contaminants like water, ice, snow, manure, detergent, forage, and hay. Men had a lower STF injury risk compared to women (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.61-0.67). The magnitude and nature of STF injuries suggest that there is a need for improving the safety performance of floors and related structures.

A total of 294 districts constituting this city were classified according to their proximity to high-voltage power lines (either 66 kV or 220 kV). Mantel-Haenszel rate ratio is used to calculate incidence rate ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   Compared to districts of which no area fell within 300 m of high-voltage power lines, districts in which at least 50% of the area fell within 300 m of high-voltage power lines demonstrated an increased risk (incidence rate ratio: 2.2; 95% CI: 0.5-9.0). The association was strengthened for homes in which patients had resided for the longest interval of their lives (incidence rate ratio: 3.4; 95% CI: 0.9-13.2).

Epidemiology is defined as the ""science of investigating the distribution of diseases in human populations and their determinants."" Recent advances in study methodology, especially a widespread conduct of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have strengthened the scientific basis of epidemiology. When a highly scientific method of investigation is applied to humans, the ethical aspects of the study also become an issue. However, it would also be unethical to use new drugs and vaccines without scientific evidence. The ethical aspects and the scientific aspects of epidemiologic research are thus both very important, but conflict with each other, often causing dilemmas. I would discuss how we could solve these dilemmas and thus contribute ourselves to health promotion and disease prevention of human populations. Finally, I would propose the new paradigm of changing epidemiology into a ""neotype science"" and transformation of EKIGAKU (epidemiology) into EKIGAKU (beneficial science).""","""['Shigeru Hisamichi']""","""[' Department of Public Health and Forensic Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.']""","""2004""","""2004 Jul""","""J Epidemiol""","""['Clinical epidemiology: from the view points of science and ethics.', 'The Ethical Challenges of Socially Responsible Science.', 'Obstacles to researching the researchers: a case study of the ethical challenges of undertaking methodological research investigating the reporting of randomised controlled trials.', 'Ethical issues in pragmatic randomized controlled trials: a review of the recent literature identifies gaps in ethical argumentation.', 'Ethics in epidemiology and public health II.

Previous estimates have relied on self report, differ by a factor of 10 or more, and are viewed as highly controversial.  Design and setting:   The reported uses of firearms in a newspaper covering roughly the Phoenix metropolitan area over almost a 3.5 month period were examined, supplemented where necessary by police and court records.  Results:   Two DGUs involving killing assailants and one involving firing at an assailant were found. The three DGUs stemmed from cases of ""mutual combat"" or exposed bystanders to gunfire.  Conclusions:   These findings cast doubt on rates of DGUs reported in an influential study by Kleck and Gertz, which predict that the police should have known about 98 DGU killings or woundings and 236 DGU firings at adversaries during the time the newspaper was surveyed. The findings reported here were closer to predictions based on the National Crime Victimization Survey, which suggest that the police should have known about eight DGU killings or woundings and 19 DGU firings at adversaries.""","""['J F Denton', 'W V Fabricius']""","""[' Mountain Pointe High School, USA.']""","""2004""","""2004 Apr""","""Inj Prev""","""['Variation in Rates of Fatal Police Shootings across US States: the Role of Firearm Availability.', 'Homicide-suicide (dyadic death), homicide, and firearms use in England and Wales.', 'The relationship between gun ownership and stranger and nonstranger firearm homicide rates in the United States, 1981-2010.', 'Underestimates of unintentional firearm fatalities: comparing Supplementary Homicide Report data with the National Vital Statistics System.', 'Gunshot victimisations resulting from high-volume gunfire incidents in Minneapolis: findings and policy implications.']"""

It would be particularly useful in general practice to identify any positive association between depression and other illness as this would make depression less likely to be missed in the consultation. Morbidity data recorded in the UK second national morbidity study were analysed, attention being confined to patients aged 45 years and over, who would be more likely to be suffering from chronic illness. During the year December 1971 to November 1972, there were 4 911 patients recorded as having depression who also consulted with other conditions. Morbidity codings were analysed to discover whether any of these conditions was recorded more or less frequently than might have happened by chance in the depressed group. Examples of conditions both positively and negatively associated with depression were revealed, the former being the more highly significant statistically. Validation of these findings should be sought in a similar analysis of the data from the UK third national morbidity survey, soon to be published.""","""['C M Harris']""","""[]""","""1986""","""1986 Jun""","""Fam Pract""","""['How does the content of consultations affect the recognition by general practitioners of major depression in women?', 'Cancer patients consultation patterns in primary care and levels of psychological morbidity: findings from the Health Survey for England.', 'Primary care consultation rates among people with and without severe mental illness: a UK cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.', 'Dental consultations in UK general practice and antibiotic prescribing rates: a retrospective cohort study.', ""NHS services for epilepsy from the patient's perspective: a survey of primary, secondary and tertiary care access throughout the UK.""]"""
