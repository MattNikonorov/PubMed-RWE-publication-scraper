Therefore, it is of great value to report new cases of chromosomal aberrations associated with normal phenotypes or clinical abnormalities. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of seven pedigrees that carried 21q21.1-q21.2 aberrations. G-banding and single-nucleotide polymorphism array techniques were used to analyze chromosomal karyotypes and copy number variations in the fetuses and their family members. Results: All fetuses and their family members showed normal karyotypes in seven pedigrees. Here, it was revealed that six fetuses carried maternally inherited 21q21.1-q21.2 duplications, ranging from 1 to 2.7 Mb, but none of the mothers had an abnormal phenotype. In one fetus, an 8.7 Mb deletion of 21q21.1-q21.2 was found. An analysis of the pedigree showed that the deletion was also observed in the mother, brother, and maternal grandmother, but no abnormal phenotypes were found. Conclusion: This study identified 21q21.1-q21.2 aberrations in Chinese pedigrees. The carriers of 21q21.1-q21.2 duplications had no clinical consequences based on their phenotypes, and the 21q21.1-q21.2 deletion was transmitted through three generations of normal individuals. This provides benign clinical evidence for pathogenic assessment of 21q21.1-q21.2 duplication and deletion, which was considered a variant of uncertain significance and a likely pathogenic variant in previous reports.""","""['Huamei Hu', 'Rong Zhang', 'Yongyi Ma', 'Yanmei Luo', 'Yan Pan', 'Juchun Xu', 'Lupin Jiang', 'Dan Wang']""","""[' Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Genet""","""['A prenatal diagnosis case of partial duplication 21q21.1-q21.2 with normal phenotype maternally inherited.', 'A prenatal diagnosis and genetics study of five pedigrees in the Chinese population with Xp22.31 microduplication.', 'A prenatally ascertained, maternally inherited 14.8 Mb duplication of chromosomal bands Xq13.2-q21.31 associated with multiple congenital abnormalities in a male fetus.', 'Molecular genetic characterization of a prenatally detected 1.484-Mb Xq13.3-q21.1 duplication encompassing ATRX and a literature review of syndromic intellectual disability and congenital abnormalities in males with a duplication at Xq13.3-q21.1.', 'Prenatal Diagnosis and Molecular Cytogenetic Characterization of Copy Number Variations on 4p15.2p16.3, Xp22.31, and 12p11.1q11 in a Fetus with Ultrasound Anomalies: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Xp22.31 copy number variations in 87 fetuses: refined genotype-phenotype correlations by prenatal and postnatal follow-up.']"""

The primary objective of this study was to integrate external load data garnered from all on-court activity throughout an NBA season, according to different activity and player characteristics. Methods: Data from 14 professional male basketball players (mean ± SD; age, 27.3 ± 4.8 years; height, 201.0 ± 7.2 cm; body mass, 104.9 ± 10.6 kg) playing for the same club during the 2017-2018 NBA season were retrospectively analyzed. Game and training data were integrated to create a consolidated external load measure, which was termed integrated load. Players were categorized by years of NBA experience (1-2y, 3-5y, 6-9y, and 10 + y), position (frontcourt and backcourt), and playing rotation status (starter, rotation, and bench). Results: Total weekly duration was significantly different (p < 0.001) between years of NBA playing experience, with duration highest in 3-5 year players, compared with 6-9 (d = 0.46) and 10+ (d = 0.78) year players. Starters experienced the highest integrated load, compared with bench (d = 0.77) players. There were no significant differences in integrated load or duration between positions. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the seasonal training loads of NBA players for an entire season and shows that a most training load is accumulated in non-game activities. This study highlights the need for integrated and unobtrusive training load monitoring, with engagement of all stakeholders to develop well-informed individualized training prescription to optimize preparation of NBA players.""","""['Jennifer L Russell', 'Blake D McLean', 'Sean Stolp', 'Donnie Strack', 'Aaron J Coutts']""","""[' Faculty of Health, School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation, University of Technology Sydney, Moore Park, NSW, Australia.', ' Human and Player Performance, Oklahoma City Thunder Professional Basketball Club, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Psychol""","""['External, Internal, Perceived Training Loads and Their Relationships in Youth Basketball Players Across Different Positions.', 'Comparing Weekly Training and Game Demands According to Playing Position in a Semiprofessional Basketball Team.', ""Monitoring Training Load and Well-Being During the In-Season Phase in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Men's Basketball."", 'Return to play and performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the National Basketball Association: surgeon case series and literature review.', 'Heart Rate Monitoring in Basketball: Applications, Player Responses, and Practical Recommendations.', 'Training and match demands differ between the regular season and finals in semi-professional basketball.']"""

A total of 421 AMI patients who were treated with PCI and experienced MACEs within 1 year of their admission were included in this retrospective study. In addition, patients were matched for age, sex, and presentation with 561 patients after AMI who had not had MACEs. The clinical characteristics and risk factors for MACEs within 1 year in AMI patients were investigated, to develop a nomogram for MACEs based on univariate and multivariate analyses. The C statistic was used to assess the discriminative performance of the nomogram. In addition, calibration curve and decision curve analyses were conducted to validate the calibration performance and utility, respectively, of the nomogram. After univariate and multivariate analyses, a nomogram was constructed based on age (odds ratio (OR): 1.030; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.047), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.667; 95% CI: 1.151-2.415), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 1.332; 95% CI: 1.134-1.565), uric acid (OR: 1.003; 95% CI: 1.001-1.005), lipoprotein (a) (OR: 1.003; 95% CI: 1.002-1.003), left ventricular ejection fraction (OR: 0.929; 95% CI: 0.905-0.954), Syntax score (OR: 1.075; 95% CI: 1.053-1.097), and hypersensitive troponin T (OR: 1.002; 95% CI: 1.002-1.003). The C statistic was 0.814. The calibration curve showed good concordance of the nomogram, while decision curve analysis demonstrated satisfactory positive net benefits.

Although definitive treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) is preferred for military aircrew, there are cultural and individual differences in receptivity toward RAI, and clinical guidelines that recommend antithyroid drugs (ATD) as the first line therapy. We examined a case series of Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aviators with GD treated with ATD and the impact of their condition on aeromedical disposition.CASE SERIES: All RSAF aircrew diagnosed with GD and treated with ATD over a 15-yr period were retrospectively identified and analyzed to determine the impact on their fitness for flying duties. The mean age of the 13 aircrew was 33 ± 7.1 yr (range, 25-47 yr), with 11 (84.6%) being males. There were 10 (76.9%) who had ATD as the only treatment while 3 (23.1%) were initially treated with ATD but subsequently underwent RAI or surgery. Of the 10 treated with only ATD, 3 (30.0%) were returned to restricted flying, 6 (60.0%) were returned to unrestricted flying, and 1 (10.0%) is still undergoing ATD titration. There were 10 (76.9%) aircrew who were returned to some form of flying duties while on low doses of ATD.DISCUSSION: This case series suggests that ATD is a viable treatment modality in the aeromedical management of military aviators with GD and it is possible to return military aircrew on a stable maintenance dose of ATD to flying duties. A framework is proposed to support the aeromedical decision-making process for military aircrew in the treatment of GD.Loh EH-T, Soh FW, See B, Tan BBC.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical features, laboratory tests, neuroelectrophysiological examination, imaging, treatment and outcomes of 13 patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy presenting with isolated cerebellar ataxia, who were admitted to the Department of Pediatric Neurology of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center from January 2016 to May 2021. Results: Among the 13 cases, 6 were males and 7 were females. The onset age was 2.6 (2.0,3.3) years, 9 children had precursor infection or vaccination before the first course of disease. All the 13 children had gait abnormalities or unsteady sitting, 10 had intentional tremor, 6 had dysarthria, 3 had body tremor, 2 had nystagmus, 3 had fatigue, 3 had hypotonia, 2 had vomiting and 1 had irritability. Thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) was 500.0 (298.9,587.2) kU/L and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) was 621.9 (449.6,869.4) kU/L in 13 cases. Autoantibodies were positive in 9 cases, and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis was seen in 4 cases. Regarding electroencephalography result, 4 cases had background slowing and 1 case had occasional sharp waves. Among the 3 patients who had relapses, 1 had cerebellar atrophy shown on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the recurrence. All the patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and intensive methylprednisolone therapy during the first onset, followed by the disappearance of the symptoms, 1 patient had repeated episodes which was decreased after immunosuppressive treatment with Rituximab.Followed up for 25.0 (22.5,33.3) months after the last episode, 12 achieved complete remission and 1 had a wide base gait. Conclusions: Trunk ataxia is the common symptom of Hashimoto's encephalopathy presenting with isolated cerebellar ataxia in children.Children with cerebellar ataxia should be tested for TgAb and TPOAb to detect Hashimoto's encephalopathy, avoiding missed diagnosis and treatment delays; IVIG and intensive steroid therapy is effective, and immunosuppressive therapy for patients with multiple relapses could reduce the recurrence.""","""['Y T Liao', 'W X Chen', 'C Hou', 'H X Zhu', 'L F Chen', 'Y R Zeng', 'W X Wu', 'H C Liang', 'X J Li']""","""["" Department of Pediatric Neurology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou 510120, China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi""","""[""Progressive cerebellar ataxia with euthyroid Hashimoto's disease--implication of autoantibodies associated with Hashimoto's disease in progressive cerebellar ataxia."", 'Cerebellar Ataxia and Autoantibodies.', ""Anti-NAE autoantibodies and clinical spectrum in Hashimoto's encephalopathy."", ""Ataxic form of Hashimoto's encephalopathy."", ""Hashimoto's encephalopathy and autoantibodies."", 'Hashimoto Encephalopathy-Still More Questions than Answers.']"""

Participants were grouped into infectious disease, inflammatory disease, malignancy and others and according to the classification of diseases and also grouped into those aged<1 year, 1-<3 years,3-<6 years, 6-<12 years and 12-<18 years. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and χ² test. Results: Among the 357 patients (217 males and 140 females). The age of onset was 3.9 (1.3, 9.2) years and visiting age was 5.1 (2.0, 9.3) years. The time-consuming of diagnosis was 94 (66, 213) days. The hospital stay was 8 (6, 14) days. The most frequently identified cause of FUO was infectious diseases (163 cases, 45.7%), followed by non-infectious inflammatory diseases (133 cases, 37.2%), malignancy (21 cases, 5.9%) and others (40 cases, 11.2%). The patients at younger age were more likely to be attacked by malignancy, oncologic diagnoses, and others, nevertheless patients at older age were more likely to be attacked by non-infectious inflammatory diseases oppositely (9.8 (3.6, 11.5) vs. 3.0 (1.2, 7.0), 2.3 (1.0, 5.2), 0.9 (0.5, 1.8) years, U=41.30, 15.94, 37.08, all P<0.01);106 (65%) patients were male, and 57 (35%) patients were female. This result indicated that boys were more susceptible to infectious diseases (χ²=14.73, P<0.01). Analysis of inflammatory factors in serum among 103 patients, interleukin (IL)-6 level in 40 infectious diseases patients (9 (2, 38) ng/L) was significantly lower than those of 6 tumor patients (89 (64, 599) ng/L) and 57 non-infectious inflammatory diseases patients (25 (8, 78) ng/L, U=51.05, 15.70, both P<0.05), no significant difference was observed in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α and interferon among the groups (all P>0.05). The patients grouped into those aged 1-<3 years and 3-<6 years were more likely to be attacked by infectious diseases (51.3% (59/115) and 57.1% (40/70)), while patients grouped into those aged 6-<12 years and 12-<18 years were more likely to be attacked by non-infectious inflammatory diseases (55.6% (65/117) and 72.4% (21/29)). Conclusions: Infectious disease is still the main cause of FUO in children and the boys are more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Another 20 out-patient children without syncope or syncope aura were selected as control. According to the results of standing test and head-up tilt test (HUTT), all the patients with OI were divided into the following 4 groups: vasovagal syncope (VVS) group, postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) group, POTS combined with VVS (POTS+VVS) group and HUTT negative group. Then, coefficient of variation of systolic pressure (SBPCV), coefficient of variation of diastolic pressure (DBPCV) and coefficient of variation of heart rate (HRCV) in standing test and HUTT were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison among the five groups, and Dunnett's T3 method for comparison between two groups. Paired t test was used to compare the coefficient of variation between supine and erect position and tilt position in each group. The predictive values of HRCV,SBPCV and DBPCV for negative HUTT were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Among the 379 children, there were 79 in HUTT negative group, 208 in VVS group, 52 in POTS group, and 40 in POTS+VVS group. The SBPCV of supine-erect position of the control group, HUTT negative group, VVS group, POTS group, POTS+VVS group were (3.8±1.0)%, (5.3±2.2)%, (6.6±3.4)%, (5.9±3.6)%, (6.9±2.8)%, respectively.

All the indexes showed significant differences among the five groups (χ2=21.91, 25.47, 19.82, 14.65, 104.52, 92.51, all P<0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that when the SBPCV and HRCV of supine-erect position reached 4.4% and 10.5%, the area under the curve of ROC were 0.713 and 0.877, the sensitivity of predicting negative HUTT were 58.2% and 78.5%, and the specificity were 80.0% and 95.0%, respectively.

Thirty-three patients who underwent Pul-Stent implantation in Shanghai Children's Medical Center due to postoperative residual pulmonary artery stenosis from August 2014 to June 2015 were included. The immediate curative effect, follow-up and complications of Pul-Stent implantation were assessed. Comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired Student t test. Results: Pul-Stent implantation of 33 patients (19 males and 14 females) were performed successfully. Thirty-one patients underwent percutaneous stenting, and 2 patients underwent hybrid stenting. A total of 35 Pul-Stents were implanted (19 of model small, 15 of model medium and one of model large), 23 stents were planted in the proximal left pulmonary artery and 12 stents were in the proximal right pulmonary artery. The initial diameter of dilation balloon ranged from 6 to 16 mm, and the long sheath of percutaneous implantation ranged from 8 to 10 F in 29 patients (29/31, 94%). After stenting, the diameter of the narrowest segment of pulmonary artery increased from (4.0±1.7) mm to (9.1±2.1) mm in all patients (t=-21.60, P<0.001). The pressure gradient at the stenosis in 26 patients after biventricular correction decreased from (30.5±12.3) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) to (9.9±9.6) mmHg (t=12.92, P<0.001), and the right ventricular to aortic pressure ratio decreased from 0.57±0.14 to 0.44±0.12 (t=7.44, P<0.001). The pressure of the superior vena cava after stenting in 5 patients after cavopulmonary anastomosis decreased from (17.0±1.9) mmHg to (14.0±0.7) mmHg (t=2.86, P=0.046). Two patients died during reoperation for repairing other cardiac malformations. The remaining 31 patients were clinically stable during the follow-up period of (5.3±1.6) years, and one stent fracture was found on chest X-ray. Cardiac catheterization reexaminations in 16 patients showed that restenosis was found in one stent, while stent position and patency were satisfactory in the remaining stents. Nine children underwent post-dilation without stent fracture, displacement or aneurysm formation. Cardiac tomography showed no stent stenosis, fracture observed, or significant change in diameter of the stent in 8 patients. The inner diameter and pulmonary blood perfusion could not be accurately evaluated due to artifacts by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 4 patients.

IFX was administered to: (1) 35 children (51%) with persistent fever who did not respond to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or steroids, 28 of the 35 children (80%) developed CAA before IFX therapy; (2) 32 children (47%) with continuous progression of CAA; (3) 1 child with persistent arthritis. In all cases, IFX was administered as an additional treatment (the time from the onset of illness to IFX therapy was 21 (15, 30) days) which consisted of second line therapy in 20 (29%), third line therapy in 20 (29%), and fourth (or more) line therapy in 28 (41%). C-reactive protein (8 (4, 15) vs. 16 (8, 43) mg/L, Z=-3.38, P=0.001), serum amyloid protein A (17 (10, 42) vs. 88 (11, 327) mg/L, Z=-2.36, P=0.018) and the percentage of neutrophils (0.39±0.20 vs. 0.49±0.21, t=2.63, P=0.010) decreased significantly after IFX administration. Fourteen children (21%) did not respond to IFX and received additional therapies mainly including steroids and cyclophosphamide. There was no significant difference in gender, age at IFX administration, time from the onset of illness to IFX administration, the maximum coronary Z value before IFX administration, and the incidence of systemic aneurysms between IFX-sensitive group and IFX-resistant group (all P>0.05). Infections occurred in 11 cases (16%) after IFX administration, including respiratory tract, digestive tract, urinary tract, skin and oral infections. One case had Calmette-Guérin bacillus-related adverse reactions 2 months after IFX administration. All of these adverse events were cured successfully. One child died of CAA rupture, 6 children were lost to follow up, the remaining 61 children were followed up for 6 (4, 15) months. No CAA occurred in 7 children before and after IFX treatment, while CAA occurred in 54 children before IFX treatment. CAA regressed in 23 (43%) children at the last follow-up, and the diameter of coronary artery recovered to normal in 10 children. Conclusion: IFX is an effective and safe therapeutic choice for children with Kawasaki disease who are refractory to IVIG or steroids therapy or with continuous progression of CAA.""","""['L P Xie', 'L Zhao', 'C Chu', 'L He', 'X C Liang', 'S N Sun', 'Q M Zhao', 'F Wang', 'Y Y Cao', 'Y X Lin', 'Z Q Zeng', 'L Wu', 'G Y Huang', 'F Liu']""","""["" Heart Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, National Children's Medical Center, Shanghai 201102, China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi""","""['Effective infliximab therapy for the early regression of coronary artery aneurysm in Kawasaki disease.', 'Analysis of 2 diagnostic criteria of echocardiography for coronary artery aneurysm in Kawasaki disease.', 'Treatment Intensification in Patients With Kawasaki Disease and Coronary Aneurysm at Diagnosis.', 'Coronary Artery Aneurysms in Kawasaki Disease: Risk Factors for Progressive Disease and Adverse Cardiac Events in the US Population.', 'Cyclophosphamide use in treatment of refractory Kawasaki disease with coronary artery aneurysms.']"""

Several factors contribute to this risk including the need to provide care to complex patients who are unknown to staff, the frequent use of verbal orders, and the necessity of weight-based dosing. This investigation sought to assess one potentially error-prone event, antibiotic prescriptions written for patients being discharged from the PED, and to characterize the occurrence of medication errors to identify opportunities for improvement.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients seen at a large academic medical center PED. All prescriptions written for an antibiotic for patients 18 years or younger that were discharged from the PED from 2015 to 2018 were evaluated for errors in directions, indication, dose, quantity, and refills. Because antibiotic dosing can vary based on indications, only disease states with guideline-specific dosing recommendations were evaluated for dosing errors.  Results:   A total of 11,815 antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed for patients discharged from the PED, and 1986 (16.8%) errors were identified. Of all the prescriptions reviewed, 517 (4.4%) contained an incomplete prescription error. Discharge prescriptions written by off-service physicians were more likely to contain incomplete prescription errors (5.1%) when compared with emergency medicine physicians (3.9%; P = 0.022). A dosing error rate of 18.5% (1469 prescriptions) was identified for the 7930 disease state-specific prescriptions reviewed. Underdosing errors were significantly more common (51.6%) than overdosing errors (29.3%; P < 0.0001). Among the different agents, there was noted to be a significant difference in the antibiotics most commonly involved in dosing errors (P < 0.0001). Additionally, there was also a significant difference in the incidence of dosing errors between different disease states (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was found in the incidence of dosing errors across physician specialties (P = 0.872).  Conclusions:   We identified 1986 (16.8%) total errors in this analysis of antibiotic prescriptions written on discharge from the PED. Among the disease states evaluated, dosing errors were identified in 18.5% of prescriptions with the most common error being underdosing. Literature evaluating pediatric prescription errors, and specifically antibiotic discharge prescriptions, is quite limited. Further investigation is necessary in this area, and strategies should be developed leveraging technology, enhancing education, and using pharmacy personnel to help reduce antibiotic prescribing errors for patients discharged from the PED.""","""['Elizabeth C LaScala', 'Alexandra K Monroe', 'Gregory A Hall', 'Kyle A Weant']""","""[' From the College of Pharmacy.', ' Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', ' Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcomes Sciences, University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Columbia, SC.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Emerg Care""","""['Assessment of Emergency Department Antibiotic Discharge Prescription Dosing Errors for Pediatric Patients in a Community Hospital Health System.', 'Prescribing errors in a pediatric emergency department.', 'Incidence of prescription errors in patients discharged from the emergency department.', 'Pediatric emergency department discharge prescriptions requiring pharmacy clarification.', 'Assessing controlled substance prescribing errors in a pediatric teaching hospital: an analysis of the safety of analgesic prescription practice in the transition from the hospital to home.']"""

Materials and Methods Retrospective study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2019. We studied 568 cases of breast carcinoma and classified them into four molecular subtypes-luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER 2), and triple negative. Cases were divided into two different groups: (1) ≤40 years and (2) >40 years. Statistical Analysis was done by using SPSS software version 20.0. Results Out of 568 cases, 151 (26.6%) were ≤40 years of age and 417 (73.4%) were >40 years of age. The most common histological subtype of breast cancer was ductal carcinoma in 548 cases and the most common grade was grade III. Immunohistochemistry was done in 432 patients. In younger age group, the most common molecular subtype was luminal B (31%) followed by triple negative (20%), luminal A (14%), and then HER 2 (5.3%), while in the older age group most common molecular subtype was luminal B (27.8%) followed by triple negative (14%), HER 2 (12.2%), and then luminal A (12%). Conclusion Luminal B is found to be the most common subtype in Northeast Indian women with breast cancer, as compared with other studies in which luminal A was the most common subtype.

Methods:   Associations between OS and objective response (OR) by mRECIST or early tumor shrinkage (ETS; ≥20% reduction in enhancing tumor diameter at the first follow-up imaging) were analyzed in HCC patients treated with sorafenib within a multicenter phase II trial (SORAMIC). 115 patients were included in this substudy. The relationship between survival and OR or ETS were explored. Landmark analyses were performed according to OR at fixed time points. Cox proportional hazards models with OR and ETS as a time-dependent covariate were used to compare survival with factors known to influence OS.  Results:   The OR rate was 29.5%. Responders had significantly better OS than non-responders (median 30.3 vs. 11.4 months; HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.22-0.63], p < 0.001), and longer progression-free survival (PFS; median 10.1 vs. 4.3 months, p = 0.015). Patients with ETS ≥ 20% had longer OS (median 22.1 vs. 11.4 months, p = 0.002) and PFS (median 8.0 vs. 4.3 months, p = 0.034) than patients with ETS < 20%. Besides OR and ETS, male gender, lower bilirubin and ALBI grade were associated with improved OS in univariate analysis. Separate models of multivariable analysis confirmed OR and ETS as independent predictors of OS.  Conclusion:   OR according to mRECIST and ETS in patients receiving sorafenib treatment are independent prognostic factors for OS.

Materials and methods:   From February 2011 to October 2020, a total of 233 patients with single nodular HCC ≤ 5 cm who underwent RFA ± transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as first-line therapy was enrolled and analyzed, including 56 patients in the periportal group and 177 patients in the nonperiportal group. The long-term therapeutic outcomes between the two groups were compared, risk factors of tumor recurrence or progression were evaluated.  Results:   The LTP rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were significantly higher in the periportal group than those in the nonperiportal group (15.7, 33.7, and 46.9% vs 6.0, 15.7, and 28.7%, respectively, P = 0.0067).

Following Taiwan's Taskforce of Medical School Curriculum Reform recommendations, the medical school curriculum was reduced from 7 to 6 years. This study aimed to analyze the impact of medical school curriculum reform on medical students' performance in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the OSCE records at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei VGH), one of Taiwan's largest tertiary medical centers, between November 2016 and July 2020. The eligibility criteria were medical students receiving a full one-year clinical sub-internship training at Taipei VGH and in their last year of medical school. All medical students received a mock OSCE-1 at the beginning of their sub-internship, a mock OSCE-2 after six months of training, and a national OSCE at the end of their sub-internship. The parameters for performance in OSCEs included ""percentage of scores above the qualification standard"" and ""percentage of qualified stations.""  Results:   Between November 2016 and July 2020, 361 undergraduates underwent clinical sub-internship training at Taipei VGH. Among them, 218 were taught under the 7-year curriculum, and 143 were instructed under the 6-year curriculum. Based on baseline-adjusted ANCOVA results, medical students under the 7-year curriculum had a higher percentage of scores above the qualification standard than those under the 6-year curriculum at the mock OSCE-1 (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 33.8% [95% CI 32.0-35.7] vs. 28.2% [95% CI 25.9-30.4], p < 0.001), and mock OSCE-2 (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 89.4% [95% CI 87.4-91.4] vs. 84.0% [95% CI 81.5-86.4], p = 0.001). Moreover, medical students in the 7-year curriculum had a higher percentage of qualified stations in mock OSCE-1 (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 89.4% [95% CI 87.4-91.4] vs. 84.0% [95% CI 81.5-86.4], p = 0.001) and mock OSCE-2 (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 91.9% [95% CI 90.1-93.8] vs. 86.1% [95% CI 83.8-88.3], p = 0.001). After clinical sub-internship training, there were no differences in the percentage of scores above the qualification standard (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 33.5% [95% CI 32.2-34.9] vs. 34.6 [95% CI 32.9-36.3], p = 0.328) and percentage of qualified stations (7-year curriculum vs. 6-year curriculum: 89.4% [95% CI 88.1-90.7] vs. 90.2% [95% CI 88.6-91.8], p = 0.492).

For patients who were previously treated with taxanes were more resistant, subsequent eribulin treatment chemotherapy PFS was generally for two months. However, for patients who chose eribulin combined with anlotinib for the latter-line regimen, PFS reached for five months, and these patients were in continuous remission. Among the 18 patients, 17 patients (94.4%) had different degrees of bone marrow suppression. Patients who have not been treated with taxanes or who have been treated with taxanes for a long response time, experience better effects when eribulin was used as subsequent treatment. Eribulin combined with anlotinib is the preferred combination therapy.

Methodology:   Patients who were under the age of 40 years at the time of diagnosis were included. Patients' characteristics and disease parameters were recorded. PIV was calculated according to (neutrophil x platelet x monocyte/lymphocyte, i.e. NxPxM/L) formula. Since a cut-off value with max sensitivity and specificity could not be obtained with ROC analysis, the median value of PIV was used as cut-off value. The relationship between PIV and pathological parameters was evaluated by ROC curves. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for OS and the log-rank test was used to evaluate the survival differences between the two groups, according to the optimal cut-off point.  Results:   Based on the PIV cut-off value of 121 (49.8%) patients were in the low PIV and 122 (50.2%) patients were in the high PIV group. The patients in the high PIV group had a statistically significantly more advanced AJCC stage, and were younger patients. In the survival analysis, it was observed that the survival was worse in the high PIV group but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.112).

The goal of this study was to examine the association between insurance status and receipt of contraceptives among young women receiving care within a large integrated health care system in the Southeastern United States to better inform strategies for increasing access to contraception.METHODS This retrospective study used electronic medical record data from an integrated health care system based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data were analyzed for 51,900 women aged 18-29 who lived in Mecklenburg County and had at least 1 primary care visit between 2014 and 2016. Contraceptive orders were identified by service and procedure codes and grouped into long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) and non-LARC categories. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the association between receipt of contraceptives and insurance status.RESULTS Compared to non-Hispanic White women with commercial insurance, non-Hispanic Black (OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.38) and Hispanic (OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.93-2.61) women with Medicaid had higher odds of receiving LARC. Similar variations by insurance and race/ethnicity were observed for the non-LARC group.LIMITATIONS Data were limited to a single health care system and did not capture contraceptive orders by unaffiliated providers. Analyses used the most frequent payor and did not account for changes in insurance status.CONCLUSION Findings indicate an important role of race/ethnicity and insurance coverage in contraceptive care. Higher receipt of LARC among Black and Hispanic women also suggests that implicit biases may influence contraception counseling and promotion practices. Future study is warranted to further delineate these relationships.""","""['Tsai-Ling Liu', 'Yhenneko J Taylor', 'Johanna Claire Schuch', 'Lisa Tucker', 'Kathryn M Zager', 'Michael F Dulin']""","""[' Assistant professor, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of neurocritical patients admitted to the department of intensive care unit (ICU) of the Xindu District People's Hospital of Chengdu from January 1st to December 31st, 2019. Patients were divided into tracheostomy group and non-tracheostomy group according to whether they underwent tracheotomy during hospitalization; according to SET score, patients were divided into groups with SET score < 10 points and SET score ≥ 10 points. The differences in gender, age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), Glasgow coma score (GCS), SET score, the length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation time were compared between the two groups. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to analyze the predictive value of SET score for the length of ICU stay > 10 days, mechanical ventilation time > 5 days, and tracheotomy treatment, and the predictive value of APACHE II score for tracheotomy treatment.  Results:   Among 66 patients, 35 cases underwent a tracheotomy, 31 cases did not; SET score < 10 points in 19 cases, while SET score ≥ 10 points in 47 cases. Compared with the non-tracheostomy group, there were more male patients in the tracheostomy group (cases: 27 vs. 13), the GCS score was lower (7.00±2.41 vs. 11.52±2.00), the APACHE II score and the SET score were higher (22.43±4.45 vs. 19.58±5.86, 16.11±3.67 vs. 8.61±4.27), and the length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation time was longer [days: 27.54±18.82 vs. 7.45±5.30, 13 (9, 19) vs. 0 (0, 2)], and all differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). Compared with SET score < 10 points group, the proportion of traumatic brain injury and tracheotomy in the SET score ≥ 10 points group was higher (44.68% vs. 15.79%, 70.21% vs. 5.26%), the GCS score was lower (8.00±2.87 vs. 11.89±1.97), APACHE II score was higher (22.30±4.80 vs. 18.11±5.49), and the length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation time was longer [days: 22.38±18.74 vs. 7.53±4.60, 9 (4, 16) vs. 0 (0, 2)], and the differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SET score predicting the length of ICU stay > 10 days of neurocritical patients was 0.877, and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.790-0.964 (P = 0.000), and its cut-off value was 13.50, the sensitivity was 80.0%, and the specificity was 87.1%.

Methods:   The data of patients admitted to the department of critical medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from June 2016 to June 2019 were analyzed. All patients were monitored by pulse indication continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitor more than 24 hours and diagnosed as SCM with ACP less than 80%. The predictors of 30-day death risk of SCM patients were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to establish the prediction model for 30-day death risk of SCM patients, which was displayed by the nomogram. Finally, the discrimination and calibration of the model were analyzed by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and consistency index (C-index).  Results:   A total of 102 patients with SCM were included and the 30-day mortality was 60.8% (62 cases). Among 102 patients with SCM, 57 patients (55.9%) had mild impairment of cardiac function (60% ≤ ACP < 80%), and the 30-day mortality was 43.9% (25/57); 39 patients (38.2%) had moderate impairment of cardiac function (40% ≤ ACP < 60%), and the 30-day mortality was 79.5% (31/39); 6 patients (5.9%) had severe impairment of cardiac function (ACP < 40%), and the 30-day mortality was 100% (6/6). There was significantly difference in mortality among the three groups (χ2 = 24.156, P < 0.001). The potential risk factors for 30-day death of SCM patients screened by univariate Cox regression analysis were included in multivariate Cox regression analysis. The results showed that the independent risk factors for 30-day death of SCM patients were acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II [APACHE II, risk ratio (HR) = 1.031, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.002-1.061, P = 0.039], vasoactive inotropic score (VIS, HR = 1.003, 95%CI was 1.001-1.005, P = 0.012), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT; HR = 2.106, 95%CI was 1.089-4.072, P = 0.027), and ACP (HR = 0.952, 95%CI was 0.928-0.977, P < 0.001). The nomogram model was established based on the above independent risk factors and age, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.865 (95%CI was 0.795-0.935), P < 0.001; C-index was 0.797 (95%CI was 0.747-0.847), P > 0.05.

The neutrophil count (NEU), lymphocyte count (LYM) and NLR of peripheral blood cells were recorded on the 1st, 4th and 7th day after admission. Patients were divided into the CCI group and the non-CCI group according to whether they progressed to CCI, and differences between the two groups were compared. The CCI was defined as a MICU length of stay (LOS) ≥ 14 days and persistent organ dysfunction [sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2].

The optimal cut-off value of preoperative SII was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the confounding factors between the two groups were eliminated using the propensity score matching (PSM) method, and the correlation between preoperative SII and clinicopathological characteristics was assessed by chi-square test. Moreover, the overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method, the survival curve was plotted, and log-rank test was performed for the significance analysis between the curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   It was determined by the ROC curve that the optimal cut-off value of preoperative SII was 489.52, based on which 771 GC patients were divided into high SII (H-SII) group and low SII (L-SII) group, followed by PSM in the two groups. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that before and after PSM, the postoperative 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in L-SII group were superior to those in H-SII group, and the overall survival rate had a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). Before PSM, preoperative SII [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.707, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.074-3.533, P < 0.001] was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of GC patients. After 1:1 PSM, preoperative SII (HR = 2.669, 95%CI 1.881-3.788, P < 0.001) was still an independent risk factor for the prognosis of GC patients.

Although lumbar spondylolisthesis is a risk factor for screw invasion of the proximal joint, there is no clear conclusion regarding the two different types of spondylolisthesis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of pedicle screw placement on proximal facet invasion in the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis and isthmic spondylolisthesis.  Methods:   In total, 468 cases of lumbar spondylolisthesis treated by decompression and fusion in our hospital from January 2017 to January 2020 were included in this retrospective study. Among them, 238 cases were degenerative spondylolisthesis (group A), and 230 cases were isthmic spondylolisthesis (group B). Sex, age, body mass index, bone mineral density, preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, postoperative VAS and ODI scores at 1 month and 3 months, and angle of the proximal facet joint at the last follow-up were recorded and compared between the two groups. The degree of pedicle screw invasion of the proximal facet joint was graded and compared by the SEO grading method.  Results:   There were no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, bone mineral density, preoperative VAS and ODI scores, or proximal facet joint angle between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at 1 month and 3 months after the operation (P > 0.05). The VAS score of group A at the last follow-up was 1 (1,2). The VAS score of group B at the last follow-up was 3 (1,3). The ODI score of group A at the last follow-up was 6(4,26). The ODI score of group B at the last follow-up was 15(8,36). The VAS and ODI scores of the two groups at the last follow-up were significantly different (P < 0.05). According to the SEO grading method, the invasion of the proximal articular process by pedicle screw placement in group A involved 320 cases in grade 0, 128 cases in grade I and 28 cases in grade II. In group B, there were 116 cases in grade 0, 248 cases in grade I and 96 cases in grade II, with a significant difference (P < 0.01).

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 27 patients with 29 recurrent anterior shoulder dislocations who were treated with the arthroscopic Bankart repair were included. All cases had deep Hill-Sachs lesions according to Hardy classification that was managed with a Remplissage technique. Patients with a glenoid defect of more than 20% in the CT scan were excluded. Twenty-two patients had an epileptic seizure, while the remaining five patients had convulsions due to other causes. The mean age of the patients was 28.3 ± 6.2 years. The mean follow-up of the patients was 3.1 ± 1.2 years. Outcome measures included the shoulder range of motion that was compared with the non-injured side in the unilateral subjects and the shoulder function that was evaluated by the Rowe score and the Walch-Duplay score.

Results:   Posterior column malreduction occurred in five cases, including in one case that was re-adjusted immediately and in another case that was re-adjusted during a two-staged delayed operation. According to Burwell-Charnley's criteria, the satisfactory rate of fracture reduction was 81.8%. After 1 year, the mean AOFAS score was 81.9 (81.9 ± 9.9); the outcome was excellent in three (20.0%), good in nine (60.0%), and fair in three (20.0%). Excellent or good outcomes were noted in 12 patients (80.0%).  Conclusions:   The combined anterior and posterior approach is suggested in the second stage of plating so that the posterior column fragments can be re-adjusted intraoperatively, if necessary. Following these procedures, satisfactory reduction and recovery of good ankle function can be anticipated.""","""['Moran Huang#', 'Qiuke Wang#', 'Junjie Guan', 'Kexin Liu', 'Yunfeng Chen', 'Lei Wang']""","""["" Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and Shanghai Institute of Microsurgery on Extremities, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", "" Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and Shanghai Institute of Microsurgery on Extremities, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China. drchenyf@qq.com."", "" Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and Shanghai Institute of Microsurgery on Extremities, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China. wanglei2264@126.com.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""BMC Musculoskelet Disord""","""['Treatment of AO/OTA 43-C3 Pilon Fracture: Be Aware of Posterior Column Malreduction.', 'A Modified 2-Stage Treatment for AO/OTA 43-C1 Pilon Fractures Accompanied by Distal Fibular and Posterior Lip of the Distal Tibia Fracture.', 'Effectiveness of very low profile/variable angle locking plate internal fixation in treatment of posterior Pilon fractures extending to medial malleolus by posteromedial approach.', 'Effects of modified posteromedial approach combined raft technique for posterior Pilon fractures with collapsed articular surface.', 'Staged posterior tibial plating for the treatment of Orthopaedic Trauma Association 43C2 and 43C3 tibial pilon fractures.', 'Early Reduction of the Posterior Column: A Surgical Technique in AO/OTA C3 Tibial Pilon Fractures.']"""

Methods:   Between May 2010 and December 2019, 56 patients with extra-articular distal humeral shaft fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty eight patients were received examination by using preoperative localization of radial nerve guided by ultrasound-guided preoperative localization (group A) and 28 control patients without ultrasound-guided (group B). All patients were treated surgically for distal humeral shaft fractures by posterior approach techniques. Operative time, radial nerve exposure time, intraoperative bleeding volume, union time and iatrogenic radial nerve palsy rate were compared between the two groups. Elbow function was also evaluated using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).  Results:   A significant difference was observed between the two groups, Operative time (113.25 min vs 135.86 min) (P < 0.001), radial nerve exposure time (20.82 min vs 32.53 min) (P < 0.001), intraoperative bleeding volume (246.80 ml vs 335.52 ml) (P < 0.001). However, iatrogenic radial nerve palsy rate (3.6% vs 7.1%) (P = 0.129), the fracture union time (13.52 months vs 12.96 months) (P = 0.796) and the MEPS score (87.56 vs 86.38) (P = 0.594) were no significantly different in both groups.

The purpose of the study was to analyze the exact correlation between CT images of lateral plateau and lateral meniscus injuries in Schatzker II TPFs.  Methods:   A total of 296 patients with Schatzker II TPFs from August 2012 to January 2021 in two trauma centers were enrolled for the analysis. According to the actual situation during open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and knee arthroscopic surgery, patients were divided into meniscus injury (including rupture, incarceration, etc.) and non-meniscus injury groups. The values of both lateral plateau depression (LPD) and lateral plateau widening (LPW) of lateral tibial plateau on CT images were measured, and their correlation with lateral meniscus injury was then analyzed. The relevant receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the optimal cut-off point of the two indicators which could predict meniscus injury.  Results:   The intra- and inter-observer reliabilities of LPD and LPW were acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.8). The average LPD was 13.2 ± 3.2 mm while the average value of the group without meniscus injury was 9.4 ± 3.2 mm. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The average LPW was 8.0 ± 1.4 mm and 6.8 ± 1.6 mm in meniscus injury and non-meniscus injury groups with a significant difference (P < 0.05). The optimal predictive cut-off value of LPD and LPW was 7.9 mm (sensitivity-95.0%, specificity-58.8%, area under the curve (AUC-0.818) and 7.5 mm (sensitivity-70.0%, specificity - 70.6%, AUC - 0.724), respectively. The meniscus injury group mainly showed injuries involving the mid-body and posterior horn of lateral meniscus (98.1%, 157/160).  Conclusions:   The mid-body and posterior horn of lateral meniscus injury is more likely to occur in patients with Schatzker II TPFs when LPD > 7.9 mm and/or LPW > 7.5 mm on CT. These findings will definitely provide guidance for orthopedic surgeons in treating such injuries. During the operation, more attention is required be paid to the treatment of the meniscus and the possible fracture reduction difficulties and poor alignment caused by meniscus rupture and incarceration should be fully considered in order to achieve better surgical results.""","""['Ying Pu', 'Zhu Lei', 'Ding Wenge', 'Xu Yue', 'Jiang Xiaowei', 'Wang Kejie', 'Zhao Yiwen', 'Huang Zhihui', 'Dai Xiaoyu']""","""[' Department of Orthopedics, Changshu Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, 6 Huanghe Road, Changshu, Jiangsu Province, 215500, China.', ' Department of Orthopedics, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Road, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, 213000, China.', ' Department of Orthopedics, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Road, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, 213000, China. dxyiverson3@163.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""BMC Musculoskelet Disord""","""['A radiographic zone-based approach to predict meniscus injury in lateral tibial plateau fracture.', 'Correlation of parameters on preoperative CT images with intra-articular soft-tissue injuries in acute tibial plateau fractures: A review of 132 patients receiving ARIF.', 'Correlation between morphogical factor of lateral plateau fracture and meniscus injury.', 'Surgical fixation methods for tibial plateau fractures.', 'Association of Tibial Plateau Fracture Morphology With Ligament Disruption in the Context of Multiligament Knee Injury.']"""

The next step was the placement of an expandable titanium interbody in order to restore the vertebral height. The need for additional anterior plating with ACCF has been debatable and such technique has been evaluated by very few studies. The objective of the study is to evaluate radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with multilevel degenerative cervical spine disease treated by stand-alone cages for anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF).  Methods:   Thirty-one patients (66.5 ± 9.75 years, range 53-85 years) were analyzed. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the 10-item Neck Disability Index (NDI) were assessed preoperatively and during follow-up on a regular basis after surgery and after one year at least. Assessment of radiographic fusion, subsidence, and lordosis measurement of Global cervical lordosis (GCL); fusion site lordosis (FSL); the anterior interbody space height (ant. DSH); the posterior interbody space height (post. DSH); the distance of the cage to the posterior wall of the vertebral body (CD) were done retrospectively. Mean clinical and radiographic follow-up was 20.0 ± 4.39 months.  Results:   VAS-neck (p = 0.001) and VAS-arm (p < 0.001) improved from preoperatively to postoperatively. The NDI improved at the final follow-up (p < 0.001). Neither significant subsidence of the cages nor significant loss of lordotic correction were seen. All patients showed a radiographic union of the surgically addressed segments at the last follow up.  Conclusions:   Application of a stand-alone expandable cage in the cervical spine after one or two-level ACCF without additional posterior fixation or anterior plating is a safe procedure that results in fusion. Neither significant subsidence of the cages nor significant loss of lordotic correction were seen.  Trial registration:   Retrospectively registered.

Current standard care for knee OA leads to trivial improvement and entails multiple adverse effects or complications. Recently, investigational cell therapies injected intra-articularly, such as bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), have shown safety and therapeutic potency providing patients with pain relief. In the current retrospective comparative study, we investigated the differences in pain and functional improvements in patients with symptomatic knee OA receiving intra-articular injections of BMAC vs PRP.  Methods:   Pain and functionality scores were measured at baseline and at different time points post-injection over 12 months, using 3 self-administered, clinically validated questionnaires: the visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessing pain intensity, the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) for evaluating functionality and knee-related quality of life, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) for evaluating physical function. The repeated-measures general linear model with Sidak test for pairwise comparisons was used to investigate the influence of the treatment on the score evolution within groups (between baseline and each time point) and between groups (overall).  Results:   The BMAC group (n = 26 knees) significantly improved in VAS, KOOS, and WOMAC scores between baseline and 12 months (57.4, 75.88, and 73.95% mean score improvement, respectively). In contrast, the PRP group (n = 13 knees) witnessed nonsignificant improvement in all scores. BMAC, in comparison to PRP, induced significant improvement in outcomes by 29.38% on the VAS scale, 53.89% on the KOOS scale, and 51.71% on the WOMAC scale (P < .002, P < .01, P < .011, respectively).  Conclusions:   Intra-articular autologous BMAC injections are safe, effective in treating pain, and ameliorate functionality in patients with symptomatic knee OA to a greater extent than PRP injections.

The onset age, visual acuity, visual field, and ocular parameters were compared between patients with PACG and SACG. Non-normally distributed data were represented by M (Q1, Q3). The difference between groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U test, Chi square test, and independent sample t test. Results: A total of 243 patients (243 eyes) were included in this study. The mean onset age was (28±9) years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1∶1.79. There were 93 patients (38.3%) in PACG group and 150 (61.7%) in SACG group. The age of PACG [34(28, 38)] was older than that of SACG [28(19, 34)], and the proportion of males in the SACG group (44.0%, 66/150) was significantly higher than that in the PACG group (22.6%, 21/93) (Z=-5.34, χ2=11.46; both P<0.01). Nanophthalmos (22.7%, 34 cases), autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) (19.3%, 29 cases), uveitis (18.7%, 28 cases) and retinitis pigmentosa (14.0%, 21 cases) were the most common causes of SACG. The best corrected visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was 0.10 (0.00, 0.48) and 0.40 (0.06, 1.00), mean deviation of visual field was -8.07 (-27.49, -2.09) and -15.04 (-28.75, -5.97) dB, and subfoveal choroidal thickness was (452.3±130.7) and (396.3±120.9) μm in the PACG and SACG groups, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (Z=-4.86, -2.14; t=2.37; all P<0.05). There was no statistical difference in intraocular pressure, cup-to-disc ratio, extent of peripheral anterior synechia, central anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness between these two groups (all P>0.05). The misdiagnosis ratio was 10.7% (26/243) in all patients, while the misdiagnosis ratio of the SACG group (16.7%, 25/150) was higher than that of the PACG group (1.1%, 1/93) (χ²=14.61, P<0.001). Conclusions: PACG, nanophthalmos and ARB are the most common etiologies in young inpatients with angle-closure glaucoma. Compared to PACG, patients with SACG are younger, with worse visual acuity and more severe visual field defects, and easier to be misdiagnosed.""","""['S F Lin', 'H Xiao', 'L M Chen', 'Y L Ling', 'W Wei', 'L Fang', 'Y H Su', 'J Y Luo', 'X Liu']""","""[' Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangzhou 510060, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi""","""['Comparison of optic nerve head topography and visual field in eyes with open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma.', 'Angle-closure glaucoma in an urban population in southern India.

Methods: This is a retrospective study. All patients with a high risk for PA underwent screening test, and then proceeded to CCT and fludrocortisone suppression test (FST) on different days. The FST was used as a reference standard for PA. The plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured with an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay. Random number method was performed in the patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism (UPA), in order to make the proportion of the analyzed UPA in PA was 35%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to compare diagnostic accuracy. Results: A total of 543 patients with 400 PA patients and 143 essential hypertension (EH) patients were enrolled. The diagnostic value of post-CCT PAC was significantly higher than that of the post-CCT plasma aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR), and that of the PAC suppression percentage, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.86 (0.83, 0.89) for PAC, 0.78 (0.74, 0.82) for ARR, and 0.62 (0.56, 0.67) for the PAC suppression percentage (all P<0.01), respectively. The optimal cutoff point of post-CCT PAC for PA was 110 ng/L, in which the sensitivity and specificity were 73.25% and 79.02%, respectively. The diagnostic efficiency of post-CCT PAC was not improved either in combination with PAC suppression percentage or in combination with post-CCT ARR.

Multiple molecular studies including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and next-generation sequencing were performed to characterize the genetic alterations. Results: Two patients included one male and one female, with 59 and 57 years old, respectively. Morphologically, case 1 resembled collecting duct carcinoma or renal medullary carcinoma, which demonstrated tubular, microcapsule and reticular structures, with a remarkable myxoid background and lymphocytes infiltration; case 2 resembled Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma or type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma, which demonstrated tubular papillary and focal solid structures, with flocculent cytoplasm and many foamy histiocytes, but without myxoid background and lymphocytes infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed strongly positive expression of ALK. CK7, E-cadherin, vimentin, PAX8 and CD10 showed various degrees of expression, and other antibodies were nonreactive.

Methods:A retrospective study was conducted among patients with DLBCL in the Department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from July 2011 to September 2021. The disease location, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of DLBCL patients in head and neck were analyzed retrospectively. Results:Oropharynx（27 cases, including 25 cases in tonsil）, neck（29 cases）, nasopharynx and nasal cavity （7 cases）were included in 63 cases of DLBCL in head and neck. Pharyngalgia, pharyngeal foreign body sensation and dysphagia were the most common manifestations of oropharyngeal DLBCL, while nasal obstruction, runny nose and hyposmia were the initial manifestations of nasal and nasopharyngeal DLBCL.Under the NBI endoscopy, locally uplifted neoplasm with rough surface mucosa was observed in 34 cases DLBCL patients of oropharynx, nasopharynx and nasal cavity. Among them, 16 cases were covered with yellow-white and patchy pseudomembrane on the surface of the neoplasm, and 5 cases were detected with abnormal new vessels, including 3 cases of tonsils, 1 case of root of tongue, and 1 case of nasopharynx. Painless progressive lymphadenectasis was the common manifestation of DLBCL in head and neck, and the maximum diameter（[21.3±6.7]mm） of neck lymph nodes in the same side of DLBCL was significantly larger than that in the opposite side（[16.0±7.2]mm, P=0.009）. Sixty-three cases of DLBCL in head and neck, including 27 cases of germinal center type（GCB）, 33 cases of nongerminal center type（non-GCB）, and 3 cases of non-specific DLBCL, were confirmed the diagnosis by needle biopsy（33 cases, 52.4%） and surgical resection（30 cases, 47.6%）. The imaging features of DLBCL in head and neck were mostly showed as local soft tissue masses with uniform density and uneven enhancement, and the surrounding structures were often compressed and displaced. All the patients were treated with standard R-CHOP chemotherapy regimens, and overall survival was longer in normal LDH, and overall survival of the patients at low risk of IPI was longer than those at medium-high or high risk of IPI（PLDH=0.011, PIPI=0.022, P<0.05）. Conclusion:DLBCL mainly occurs in oropharynx, especially the unilateral tonsil. When flake yellow-white pseudomembrane adhesion and abnormal neovessels on the surface of the mass are detected under endoscopy, and the ultrasound suggested multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck with large iplateral lymph nodes, the possibility of DLBCL should be considered. Surgical resection could be performed for diagnosis if necessary, and early diagnosis would have a better prognosis.""","""['Meng Xie', 'Qingqing Zhang', 'Ruixin Guo', 'Sijing Ma', 'Xiaohong Liu', 'Yangjuan Chen', 'Na Shao', 'Haiqin Liu', 'Huanan Luo', 'Xiaoyong Ren']""","""["" Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery，the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University，Xi'an，710004，China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Lin Chung Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP-like or CHOP-like regimens: an 8-year experience from a single center.', 'A retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and prognostic factors for 124 cases of primary gastric lymphomas.', 'The application of NBI endoscopy in finding concealed primary lesions of misdiagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer.', 'Assessment of CD37 B-cell antigen and cell of origin significantly improves risk prediction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.', 'Germinal center B-cell-like versus non-germinal center B-cell-like as important prognostic factor for localized nodal DLBCL.']"""

It is not clear whether the power of this defence line is constant across the 24-h day, depends on sleep pressure levels and can be influenced by external lighting conditions. Thus, in 10 healthy young volunteers, we retrospectively analyzed saliva samples for sIgA levels under strictly controlled laboratory conditions across 40 ​h of extended wakefulness under two lighting conditions (dim light 8 lx and blue-enriched light 250 lx, 9000 ​K) to test for circadian and homeostatic sleep-wake influences. We compared the temporal profile of sIgA with the circadian time course of melatonin and cortisol along with subjective sleepiness levels, assessed in the same study by Gabel et al. (2017). The 40-h time course of sIgA exhibited a clear circadian modulation with peak values in the mornings coinciding with the individuals' habitual rise-time. In addition, sIgA levels progressively increased throughout the 40 ​h of extended wakefulness and were temporally correlated with subjective sleepiness but not with subjective ratings of tension and discomfort. In contrast to the circadian profile of melatonin and cortisol, sIgA levels were not significantly altered by the lighting conditions. Unexpectedly, sIgA levels in the morning after recovery sleep from 40 ​h of extended wakefulness rose considerably by more than an order of magnitude (10 times more) compared to morning levels after baseline sleep. We have evidence that diurnal sIgA levels in humans are regulated by the circadian timing system, and challenging the status of the sleep-wake homeostat (i.e. extended wakefulness) boosts human sIgA levels. Thus, besides a person's circadian phase position, the first line of human immune defense also strongly depends on the person's sleep-wake history and actual sleepiness levels. In sum, the fight against pathogenic microorganisms by a key immunological component (sIgA) is modulated by two fundamental processes implicated in human sleep-wake regulation.""","""['Christian Cajochen', 'Jakob Weber', 'Alejandro F Estrada', 'Kumpei Kobayashi', 'Virginie Gabel']""","""[' Centre for Chronobiology, Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Basel, Wilhelm Kleinstr. 27, CH-4002, Basel, Switzerland.', ' Transfaculty Research Platform Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Basel, Birmannsgasse 8, CHF-4055, Basel, Switzerland.', ' NovoLytiX GmbH, Benkenstrasse 254C, CH-4108, Witterswil, Switzerland.', ' Development and Engineering Department, Toshiba Materials Co.

There is still uncertainty about the risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) episodes, which may limit long-term graft survival. From March 2007 to December 2016, 58 sensitized living donor kidney transplant candidates were identified and 38 patients eventually included in the study: 36 patients (95%) had pre-transplant and pre-desensitization Luminex-detected donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA), and 17/36 patients (47%) in addition had a positive crossmatch result. Two patients had no detectable DSA but a positive CDC B-cell crossmatch result. Patients were treated with pre- and post-transplant apheresis and powerful immunosuppression including the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (N = 36) in combination with thymoglobulin (N = 20) or anti-IL2 receptor antibody (N = 18). The results of the 38 successfully desensitized and transplanted patients were retrospectively compared to the results of 76 matched standard-risk recipients. Desensitized patients showed patient and graft survival rates similar to that of standard-risk recipients (P = 0.55 and P = 0.16, respectively). There was a trend toward reduced death-censored graft survival in desensitized patients (P = 0.053) which, however, disappeared when the 34 patients who were transplanted after introduction of sensitive Luminex testing were analyzed (P = 0.43). The incidence of rejection episodes without borderline changes were in desensitized patients with 21% similar to the 18% in standard-risk patients (P = 0.74). Thirty-six patients had pre-transplant HLA class I and/or II DSA that were reduced by 85 and 81%, respectively, during pre-transplant desensitization (P < 0.001 for both). On day 360 after transplantation, 20 of 36 (56%) patients had lost their DSA. The overall AMR rate was 6% in these patients, but as high as 60% in 5 (14%) patients with persistent and de novo DSA during year 1; 2 (40%) of whom lost their graft due to AMR. Eleven (31%) patients with persistent DSA but without de novo DSA had an AMR rate of 18% without graft loss while one patient lost her graft without signs of AMR. Our desensitization protocol for pre-sensitized living donor kidney transplant recipients with DSA resulted in good graft outcomes with side effects and rejection rates similar to that of standard-risk recipients.

Increasing trends in its use, as well as new trials administering DMT to patients, indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the qualitative content, over and above structure, which the drug occasions. This is particularly in light of the hyper-real, otherworldly, and often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative, nature of the experience, not least encounters with apparently non-self social agents. Laboratory studies have been limited by clinical setting and lacking qualitative analyses of experiential content, while online surveys' limitations lie in retrospective design, uncontrolled use, and both of which not guaranteeing 'breakthrough' experiences, i.e., producing very strong psychoactive effects. Methods: We report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use including its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymised and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75 mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews (inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique) were employed immediately after their experience. This paper reports on the thematic analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the 'other'. Thirty-six post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) males (eight female) of average 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. Results: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the encounter with other 'beings' (94% of reports), encompassing super-ordinate themes including the entities' role, appearance, demeanour, communication and interaction; while the second overarching category comprised experiences of emerging into other 'worlds' (100% of reports), encompassing super-ordinate themes of the scene, the contents and quality of the immersive spaces. Many further mid-level themes and subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. Discussion: The present study provides a systematic and in-depth analysis of the nuanced content of the otherworldly encounter within the breakthrough DMT experience, as well as elaborating on the resonances both with previous DMT studies focusing on entity encounters and other types of extraordinary experiences entailing such encounters. These include the alien abduction, folkloric, shamanic and near-death experience. Putative neural mechanisms of these features of the DMT experience and its promise as a psychotherapeutic agent are discussed in light of such findings.""","""['Pascal Michael', 'David Luke', 'Oliver Robinson']""","""[' School of Human Sciences, Old Royal Naval College, University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Brain Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Centre for Psychedelic Research, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Front Psychol""","""['Phenomenology and content of the inhaled N, N-dimethyltryptamine (N, N-DMT) experience.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'DMT Models the Near-Death Experience.', 'Survey of subjective ""God encounter experiences"": Comparisons among naturally occurring experiences and those occasioned by the classic psychedelics psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, or DMT.', 'Survey of entity encounter experiences occasioned by inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine: Phenomenology, interpretation, and enduring effects.', 'Human brain effects of DMT assessed via EEG-fMRI.', 'The Bright Side of Psychedelics: Latest Advances and Challenges in Neuropharmacology.', 'Models of Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy: A Contemporary Assessment and an Introduction to EMBARK, a Transdiagnostic, Trans-Drug Model.', 'Phenomenology and content of the inhaled N, N-dimethyltryptamine (N, N-DMT) experience.', 'N,N-dimethyltryptamine and Amazonian ayahuasca plant medicine.']"""

Logistic regression analysis revealed that CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR were independent indicators for prediction of severe COVID-19, and LDH and ferritin were independent factors associated with the mortality in COVID-19. In conclusion, higher CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR were associated with severe COVID-19, whereas higher LDH and ferritin were associated with the mortality in COVID-19.

Cases:   All the three cases presented showed polybacterial recurrent infection of the revision hip arthroplasty. All patients were of younger age, had multiple revisions of the endoprosthesis, each had a large partial femoral replacement greater than 40% of the femoral length, gentamycin-loaded cement, and a long anchoring distance of the used intramedullary stem. Due to the severe life-threatening infection with deep osteomyelitis, an amputation had to be performed. However, despite surgical intervention, the fungal dominated infection persisted. Finally, only the use of caspofungin allowed permanent infection control.  Conclusion:   The polybacterial infection is driven by the symbiosis between fungi and bacteria.

Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) remains the most used marker to follow-up patients under treatment, but only limited data are available about the prognostic role of its changes over time and the impact of response to subsequent therapies. This analysis aims to assess the prognostic role of the magnitude and velocity of PSA response in CSPC and describe how this may affect the outcome to subsequent treatment outcomes in CRPC.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with de novo CSPC referring to six oncology centers in Italy. Clinical and pathological features were recorded. PSA response (PSA50), defined as a decrease > 50% compared to baseline, PSA velocity (PSAv), defined as any decrease in PSA levels over time and the deep and fast PSA response (4mPSA50), defined as the PSA response reached within the threshold of 4 months from the beginning of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have been evaluated for their impact on survival. Survivals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazard models, stratified according to baseline characteristics, were used to estimate hazard ratios for overall survival (OS).  Results:   A totals of 94.4% of patients had PSA50, which was correlated to longer OS compared to patients without PSA50 (56.0 vs. 14.8 months; p<0.001). The median PSAv was 6.9 (ng/dl)/month, which was predictive for longer OS: Each decrease of 1 (ng/dl)/month was able to improve OS by 0.2% (HR=0.998, 95%CI=0.997-1.000; p=0.008). A total of 47.9% of patients reached 4mPSA50, with a median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) to ADT-based therapy of 101.0 and 23.4 months compared to 41.9 and 11.0 months for those who did not (p<0.001), respectively. The independent prognostic role of 4mPSA50 was retained even when evaluated in multivariable analysis adjusted for other baseline characteristics and early docetaxel for CSPC. In CRPC, 4mPSA50 evaluated during CSPC retains its prognostic role even if it does not predict a different outcome between patients treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide or taxanes.  Conclusion:   Achieving a deep and fast PSA response correlates with a better outcome in patients with de novo mCSPC, also positively influencing the prognosis of the subsequent first-line therapy for CRPC disease.""","""['Roberto Iacovelli', 'Chiara Ciccarese', 'Orazio Caffo', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Umberto Basso', 'Marcello Tucci', 'Claudia Mosillo', 'Marco Maruzzo', 'Francesca Maines', 'Chiara Casadei', 'Michele Milella', 'Giampaolo Tortora']""","""[' Medical Oncology Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Nevertheless, early diagnostics of treatment failure is problematic. Cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA 21-1), an established marker in the management of pulmonary cancer, might be helpful here. Hence, in this study the impact of CYFRA 21-1 as an indicator for treatment failure and tumor recurrence (TR) in OSCC after R(C)T was analyzed.  Patients and methods:   The data of 77 patients with advanced OSCC and R(C)T were retrospectively examined. For determination of CYFRA 21-1 at the time of diagnosis and after R(C)T, an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used. Tumor residuals and tumor recurrence were pathologically verified after detection by radiological imaging and endoscopy. The mean follow-up was 44.4 months.  Results:   After R(C)T, 48 (62%) patients showed locoregional control and 29 (38%) patients experienced locoregional failure. No statistical difference in the CYFRA 21-1 level between groups both before (p=0.75) and after R(C)T (p=0.85) was found. Nevertheless, in cases of TR in follow-up, the CYFRA 21-1 level was significantly higher (p≤0.01). The occurrence of TR was significantly associated with a CYFRA 21-1 elevation at this time (p≤0.01). However, CYFRA 21-1 failed to show a suitable discriminative ability for TR (area under the curve=0.57).  Conclusion:   In OSCC, CYFRA 21-1 does not seem to be a useful marker for locoregional failure after R(C)T.

Methods:   Five patients who underwent medial and lateral talus AOT in the same session due to simultaneous OLT on medial and lateral talar dome were included in this retrospective study. All the patients were male, and the mean age was 34.8 (range = 26 - 42) years. Double osteochondral grafts were placed separately to the medial and lateral talar dome at the same session. Location and size of the OLT, additional ligament injuries, and postoperative evaluation of the graft were evaluated through magnetic resonance images (MRIs). The criteria of Berndt and Harty, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS), visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and Tegner Activity Score were assessed preoperatively and at the last follow-up.  Results:   All patients had suffered an injury with inversion of the foot while daily or sports activity. Average duration of symptoms from onset to osteochondral grafting was 25.2 months. The mean follow-up time was 61 months. The radiological evaluation showed OLT with Stage 4 or 5, anterior talofibular ligament injury and deltoid ligament strain observed in all of the patients.

However, controversial outcomes were reported in patients with Partial-Thickness Cartilage Loss (PTCL). The aim of this study is to compare PTCL and FTCL based on intraoperative findings in medial UKA in terms of functional outcomes and complication rates requiring reoperation and revision.  Methods:   Two hundred and fifteen knees of 174 patients who underwent mobile-bearing UKA between October 2014 and February 2018 for the diagnosis of symptomatic anteromedial osteoarthritis were evaluated retrospectively. A single senior surgeon evaluated the type of cartilage loss in the medial compartment intraoperatively according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score pre- and post-operatively at the last follow-up. Patients with PTCL and FTCL were compared in terms of their pre- and post-operative OKS and IKDC scores, and their improvements, as well as complication rates requiring reoperation and revision.  Results:   The mean follow-up time was 33.1 ± 5.3 months. The PTCL (n = 80) and FTCL (n = 135) groups were statistically similar in terms of age (P = 0.41), gender (P = 0.921), body mass index (P = 0.165), bilaterality (P = 0.111), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (P = 0.218), Charlson Comorbidity Index (P = 0.74), and post-operative follow-up (P = 0.167). The mean pre-operative OKS and IKDC scores were improved from 24.5 ± 4.1 and 39.9 ± 5 to 40.3 ± 3.6 and 73.9 ± 7.7 at the last follow-up, respectively (P < 0.001). Pre-operative OKS and IKDC scores were superior in favor of the PTCL group. However, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of post-operative OKS (P = 0.53) and IKDC (P = 0.975) scores, and their improvements (OKS, P = 0.953; IKDC, P = 0.536). The complication rates requiring reoperation was 5% (n = 11) in all patients. Of these, 9% (n = 7) from the PTCL group and 3% (n = 4) from the FTCL group were reoperated. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the groups (P = 0.105).  Conclusion:   In PTCL, medial UKA is a reliable surgery in terms of functional outcomes, the same as in FTCL; however, its complication rates requiring reoperation is higher without statistical significance.

The main endpoints of the study were: post-traumatic mortality, the need for surgery (laparoscopic/classic) to resolve splenic bleeding, the number of days of hospitalization, the need for hospitalization for more than 1 day in the intensive care unit, the day when the platelet count began to increase, the evolution of laboratory parameters (hospitalization, preangiography, postangiography/embolization, discharge). A secondary endpoint of the study was the frequency of complications that did not require surgery. Results: During the mentioned period in 64 patients treated nonoperatively, diagnostic angiography was performed (27 cases, group B) or therapeutic angiography (37 cases, group A). 26.56% of cases were 55 years old (55-81 years old), the predominance of males being obvious (62.5%). The mean value of the ISS was 21.7 +- 10.4, and 71.87% of cases presented ISS 16. The mean value of the ISS was 21.7 +- 10.4, and 71.87% of cases presented ISS 16. The degree of splenic injury (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-Organ Injury Scale) presented the mean value 2.95. The degree of splenic lesion was statistically significantly more severe in group A (p 0.001) and preangiography hemoglobin values were significantly lower compared to hospitalization values (p 0.001) indicating the persistence of hemorrhage. Procedural failures occurred in 4.68% of cases, with zero mortality. Conclusions: Splenic interventional radiology is a safe, effective and rational procedure. The development of therapeutic protocols is necessary to allow maximum use of this procedure.""","""['Dana Paula Venter', 'Mircea Beuran', 'Laurenţiu Gulie', 'Monica Popiel', 'Mircea Dan Venter', 'Constantin Oprescu', 'Costin Minoiu', 'George Pană', 'Bogdan Popa', 'Georgian Tiberiu Tănase']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Chirurgia (Bucur)""","""['Simultaneous organ angioembolization in nonoperative treatment strategy of blunt abdominal trauma.', 'Emergency Management of Blunt Splenic Injury in Hypotensive Patients : Total Splenectomy Versus Splenic Angioembolization.', 'Non-operative management of blunt splenic injury: is it really so extensively feasible? a critical appraisal of a single-center experience.', 'Angioembolization reduces operative intervention for blunt splenic injury.', 'Laparoscopic surgery for splenic injuries in the era of non-operative management: current status and future perspectives.']"""

Material and Method: We have established a strategy for dealing with cases of abdominal trauma with injuries by non-operative treatment (NOT). We applied NOT to 13 patients in 50 (26%), of which 8 were patients with spleen injuries and 5 were patients with liver damage. Most of the lesions were grade II (8 cases), 2 cases were grade I and 3 cases were grade III. Results: There was only one case dealt by NOT, in which surgery was performed 48 hours after admission. In two patients with extravasation of the contrast agent on CT and angiography, angioembolization of the splenic artery was performed, with good results. Control CT was performed at a period that varied between 24 hours and 5 days after admission. The average period of hospitalization of patients approached by NOT was 6,6 days. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced CT examination remains the basis for NOT initiation, providing the necessary data on the degree of liver or splenic lesion, the size of blood collections and extravasation of the contrast substance but is also the essential imaging exploration in assessing NOT efficacy. Angioembolization can be successfully performed in cases where CT examination and angiography show contrast extravasation. There was only one case included in the NOT, which was operated laparoscopically, but most authors emphasize that this should not be considered a failure of the method.""","""['Dan Cartu', 'Dragos Margaritescu', 'Sarmis Sandulescu', 'Tudor Bratiloveanu', 'Sandu Ramboiu', 'Marius Bica', 'Eugen Georgescu', 'Catalin Dudu', 'Stefan Patrascu', 'Silviu Bordu', 'Alexandru Goganau', 'Valeriu Surlin', 'Daniela Marinescu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Chirurgia (Bucur)""","""['Proximal splenic angioembolization does not improve outcomes in treating blunt splenic injuries compared with splenectomy: a cohort analysis.', 'Simultaneous organ angioembolization in nonoperative treatment strategy of blunt abdominal trauma.', 'Non operative management of blunt splenic trauma: a prospective evaluation of a standardized treatment protocol.', 'Nonoperative management of blunt splenic injury: what is new?', 'Nonoperative management of blunt splenic injury in adults: there is (still) a long way to go.

In this setting, despite conservative policy, major liver resection is still required in selected cases. Also salvage liver transplantation may be needed. Our study aims to analyze the results after definitive surgery for hepatic injury (HI) in a tertiary HPB center. Methods: Sixty-six patients with HI were admitted and treated in our center between June 2000 and June 2021. The median age was 29 years (mean 35, range 10-76). The male/female ratio was 50/16. According to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) system, HIs were grade II in one patient (1.5%), grade III in 11 pts (16.7%), grade IV in 25 pts (37.9%), and grade V in 29 pts (43.9%); no patient had grade I or VI HI. Results: Fifty-two pts (78.8%) benefitted from surgery and 14 pts (21.2%) from non-operative treatment (NOT). Perihepatic packing was previously performed in 38 pts (73.1%). Surgery consisted in hepatic resections (HR) in 51 pts (77.3%) and liver transplantation in one patient (1.5%). The rate of major HR was 51.9% (27 HRs). The overall major morbidity and mortality rates were 33.3% (20 pts) and 13.6% (9 pts), respectively. For surgery, the major complication rate was 35.3% (18 pts), while for major and minor HR were 40.7% (11 pts) and 29.2% (7 pts), respectively; the mortality rate was 15.7% (8 pts). After NOT, the major morbidity and mortality rates were 14.3% (2 pts) and 7.1% (1 pt), respectively. Conclusions: Hepatic resections, especially major ones and/or involving vascular and biliary reconstructions, as well as non-operative treatment for severe hepatic injuries, are to be carried out in tertiary HPB centers, thus minimizing the morbidity and mortality rates, while having the liver transplantation as salvage option.""","""['Alexandru Barcu', 'Bianca Mitricof', 'Cosmin Verdea', 'Laura Bălănescu', 'Dana Tomescu', 'Gabriela Droc', 'Ioana Lupescu', 'Doina Hrehoreţ', 'Vladislav Braşoveanu', 'Irinel Popescu', 'Florin Botea']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Chirurgia (Bucur)""","""['Surgical treatment for severe liver injuries: a single-center experience.', 'Surgical management and outcome of blunt major liver injuries: experience of damage control laparotomy with perihepatic packing in one trauma centre.', 'Current approach to liver traumas.', 'Predictive factors of morbidity and mortality in grade IV and V liver trauma undergoing perihepatic packing: single institution 14 years experience at European trauma centre.', 'Non-operative management versus operative management in high-grade blunt hepatic injury.']"""

Materials and methods:   The medical records of patients who had undergone FTSG or STSG with dermal substitute after skin cancer surgery between March 2016 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The scars resulting from skin grafts were assessed using the patient and observer scar assessment scales (PSAS and OSAS) in our clinic after a minimum of 6 months postoperatively.  Results:   Of the 50 study subjects, 35 patients (FTSG group) received FTSG only and 15 patients (STSG group) received STSG with the dermal substitute. The total scores of PSAS and OSAS were significantly lower in the FTSG group and it is suggested that both patients and observers thought that better scar outcomes were achieved when FTSGs were used. However, for defects smaller than 1.8 cm2 and defects located in the periorbital area, there was no statistically significant difference in the scores of PSAS and OSAS in the 2 groups. Interestingly, for defects located in the periorbital area, although there was no significant difference, PSAS and OSAS scores were lower in the STSG group than in the FTSG group. In other word, scar outcomes in the STSG group were better.  Conclusions:   Although there was no significant difference, unlike what we usually know, our result shows that STSG with dermal substitute tended to produce comparable or rather better results than FTSG under some conditions.""","""['Du-Heon Seo', 'Jin Yong Shin', 'Si-Gyun Roh', 'Suk Choo Chang', 'Nae-Ho Lee']""","""[' Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Medical School of Jeonbuk National University.', ' Research Institute of Clinical Medicine of Jeonbuk National University-Biomedical Research Institute of Jeonbuk National University Hospital, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""J Craniofac Surg""","""['Split-Thickness Skin Grafts.', 'Use of a multilayered acellular dermal substitute with simultaneous full-thickness skin graft for the one-stage coverage of nasal skin defects.', 'Demographic characteristics and outcome of burn patients requiring skin grafts: a tertiary hospital experience.', 'Human hypertrophic scar-like nude mouse model: characterization of the molecular and cellular biology of the scar process.', 'Jodhpur Technique.']"""

Materials and methods:   Twenty three patients with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury from April 2015 to December 2019 were selected, including 10 cases underwent bbDC (bilateral group) and 13 cases underwent uDC (unilateral group). Compared with the postsurgical intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow volume, postsurgical imaging score, the occurrence of complications as well as the 6 month outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOS) of two groups.  Results:   1. The postsurgical ICP was lower in the bbDC group than in the uDC group, while the postsurgical CCP and cerebral blood flow volume were higher in the bbDC group than in the uDC group. 2. Postsurgical imaging scores of the bbDC group were lower, indicating that the decompression effect of bbDC was more exhaustive than that of the uDC group. 3. The incidence of intraoperative acute cerebral bulging was lower in bbDC group than in uDC group. 4. The bbDC could effectively reduce the proportion of patients with the worst prognosis (dead+vegetative state).  Conclusion:   For patients with severe, diffuse traumatic brain injury combined with bilateral or unilateral pupil dilation, bilateral balanced decompression craniotomy is an effective method, which should be performed as soon as possible. As compared to unilateral decompression, the decompression effect on the brainstem is more thorough; the incidence of acute cerebral bulging, postoperative incisional hernia, and postoperative cerebral infarction involving a large area are reduced. ICP can be better controlled, cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow increases, improving the patient's survival rate, quality of life, and prognosis.""","""['ShengCheng Wei']""","""[' The Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""J Craniofac Surg""","""['Bilateral decompressive craniectomy for patients with malignant diffuse brain swelling after severe traumatic brain injury: a 37-case study.', 'Prognostic value of changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure before and after decompressive craniectomy following severe traumatic brain injury.', 'Outcome following decompressive craniectomy for malignant swelling due to severe head injury.', 'Decompressive Surgery for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.', 'Refractory Intracranial Hypertension: The Role of Decompressive Craniectomy.']"""

The optimal blood management approach is an area of active investigation. Thromboelastography (TEG) was used to examine changes in coagulation after surgical blood loss that was managed by transfusion with either whole blood or blood components. Transfusion type was determined by availability of whole blood from the blood bank.This retrospective study examined differences in posttransfusion TEG maximum amplitude (MA), a measure of the maximum clot strength, for patients transfused with whole blood or blood components. We included all patients less than 24 months old who underwent cranial vault remodeling, received intraoperative transfusions with whole blood or blood components, and had baseline and posttransfusion TEG measured. Whole blood was requested for all patients and was preferentially used when it was available from the American Red Cross.Of 48 eligible patients, 30 received whole blood and 18 received blood components. All patients received an intraoperative antifibrinolytic agent. The posttransfusion MA in the whole blood group was 61.8 mm (IQR 59.1, 64.1) compared to 57.9 mm (IQR 50.5, 60.9) in the blood components group (P = 0.010). There was a greater posttransfusion decrease in MA for patients transfused with blood components (median decrease of 7.7 mm [IQR -3.4, 6.3]) compared with whole blood (median decrease of 2.1 mm [IQR -9.6, 7.5] P < 0.001).Transfusion with blood components was associated with a greater decrease in MA that was likely related to decreased postoperative fibrinogen in this group.

Methods:   The clinical data of 60 patients with liver cancer admitted to our hospital (February 2018-February 2020) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with RFA and were followed up with 3D-CEUS, MRI, and enhanced CT examination after surgery.

Results:   For the 60 patients, 52 patients (86.7%) had a single lesion and 8 patients (13.3%) had multiple lesions, with a total of 72 lesions. After RFA, 56 lesions (77.8%) were completely inactivated and 16 lesions (22.2%) remained. Totally inactivated lesions were detected as follows: 51 (91.1%) by 3D-CEUS, 42 (75.0%) by MRI, and 50 (89.3%) by enhanced CT.

Secondly, we compare linear and nonlinear regression models.  Methods:   Data was sourced from a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted from 2012 to 2016, investigating the combined effect of robotic therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 24 kinematic metrics were derived from 4 shoulder-elbow tasks and 35 metrics from 3 wrist and forearm evaluation tasks. A correlation-based feature selection was performed, keeping only features substantially correlated with the target attribute (R > 0.5.) Nonlinear models took the form of a multilayer perceptron neural network: one hidden layer and one linear output.  Results:   Shoulder-elbow metrics showed a significant correlation with the Fugl Meyer Assessment (upper extremity, FMA-UE), with a R = 0.82 (P < 0.001) for the linear model and R = 0.88 (P < 0.001) for the nonlinear model. Similarly, a high correlation was found for wrist kinematics and the FMA-UE (R = 0.91 (P < 0.001) and R = 0.92 (P < 0.001) for the linear and nonlinear model respectively). The combined analysis produced a correlation of R = 0.91 (P < 0.001) for the linear model and R = 0.91 (P < 0.001) for the nonlinear model.  Conclusions:   Distal wrist kinematics were highly correlated to clinical outcomes, warranting future investigation to explore our nonlinear wrist model with acute or subacute stroke populations.

Robotic metrics may be more objective and sensitive for measuring the efficacy of interventions on stroke survivor's motor recovery. This study investigated if robotic metrics detect a difference in outcomes, not seen in clinical measures, in a study of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) preceding robotic therapy. Impact of impairment severity on intervention response was also analyzed to explore optimization of outcomes by targeting patient sub-groups.  Methods:   This 2020 study analyzed data from a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized multi-center trial conducted from 2012 to 2016, including a six-month follow-up. 82 volunteers with single chronic ischemic stroke and right hemiparesis received anodal tDCS or sham stimulation, prior to robotic therapy. Robotic therapy involved 1024 repetitions, alternating shoulder-elbow and wrist robots, for a total of 36 sessions. Shoulder-elbow and wrist kinematic and kinetic metrics were collected at admission, discharge, and follow-up.  Results:   No difference was detected between the tDCS or sham stimulation groups in the analysis of robotic shoulder-elbow or wrist metrics. Significant improvements in all metrics were found for the combined group analysis. Novel wrist data showed smoothness significantly improved (P < ·001) while submovement number trended down, overlap increased, and interpeak interval decreased. Post-hoc analysis showed only patients with severe impairment demonstrated a significant difference in kinematics, greater for patients receiving sham stimulation.  Conclusions:   Robotic data confirmed results of clinical measures, showing intensive robotic therapy is beneficial, but no additional gain from tDCS. Patients with severe impairment did not benefit from the combined intervention. Wrist submovement characteristics showed a delayed pattern of motor recovery compared to the shoulder-elbow, relevant to intensive intervention-related recovery of upper extremity function in chronic stroke.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of 213 patients, who underwent surgery in a single center of Peking University Third Hospital between January 2016 and June 2020. For right renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and venous tumor thrombus (VTT), imaging revealed a filling defect in the left renal vein, which was significantly enhanced in enhanced imaging, suggesting that the tumor thrombus grew against the direction of venous return into the left renal vein. For left RCC and VTT, at least one of the left renal vein branches has tumor thrombus. The branches include the left adrenal vein, the left gonadal vein (testicular vein or ovarian vein), and the left ascending lumbar vein. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they were GADVR tumor thrombus, and we compare the clinicopathological characteristics of GADVR tumor thrombus and non-GADVR tumor thrombus. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to explore the risk factors that affect the prognosis of patients with RCC and VTT. Kaplan-Meier plots were conducted to evaluate the effect of GADVR on progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Compared with non-GADVR tumor thrombus, patients with GADVR tumor thrombus had a higher proportion of open surgery (76.2% vs. 52.1%, P = 0.035), a higher proportion of tumor thrombus adhering to the inferior vena cava (IVC) vessel wall (81% vs. 45.8%, P = 0.002), a higher proportion of segmental resection of the IVC vessel wall (61.9% vs. 15.6%, P < 0.001); higher preoperative serum creatinine value (110.0 μmol/L vs. 91.0 μmol/L, P = 0.015), a higher proportion of tumor thrombus combined with bland thrombus (non-tumor thrombus) (57.1% vs. 19.8%, P < 0.001). In terms of surgical complexity, patients with GADVR tumor thrombus had a longer median operation time (379 min vs. 308 min, P = 0.038), more median surgical blood loss (1400 mL vs. 600 mL, P = 0.018), and more postoperative complications (52.4% vs. 30.7%, P = 0.045). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that GADVR tumor thrombus, symptoms, postoperative serum creatinine, distant metastasis, sarcomatoid feature, pathological type, lymph node dissection were independent risk factors for PFS. Patients with GADVR tumor thrombus's median survival time was 14.0 months, while patients with non-GADVR tumor thrombus were 32.0 months (P = 0.016). GADVR tumor thrombus is an independent risk factor for PFS in patients with RCC and VTT.  Conclusion:   GADVR tumor thrombus is a characteristic feature of tumor thrombus, with an incidence of 9.9%. It has a higher proportion of open surgery and higher surgical complexity, which is an independent risk factor for PFS.""","""['Zhuo Liu#', 'Yuxuan Li#', 'Xun Zhao', 'Liyuan Ge', 'Guodong Zhu', 'Peng Hong', 'Shiying Tang', 'Shudong Zhang', 'Xiaojun Tian', 'Shumin Wang', 'Cheng Liu', 'Hongxian Zhang', 'Lulin Ma']""","""["" Department of Urology, Peking University Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Haidian, Beijing, 100191, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Ultrasound, Peking University Third Hospital, Haidian District, Beijing, 100191, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Urology, Peking University Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Haidian, Beijing, 100191, People's Republic of China. malulinpku@163.com.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""BMC Surg""","""['Influence of deep invasive tumor thrombus on the surgical treatment and prognosis of patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma complicated with venous tumor thrombus.', 'Imaging predictors for assessment of inferior vena cava wall invasion in patients with renal cell carcinoma and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus: a retrospective study.', 'Surgical complexity and prognostic outcome of small volume renal cell carcinoma with high-level venous tumor thrombus and large volume renal cell carcinoma with low-level thrombus.', 'Transitional cell carcinoma with extension of the renal vein and IVC tumor thrombus: report of three cases and literature review.', 'Diagnosis and surgical management of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus--a report of 6 cases with literature review.', 'Efficacy and safety analysis of TACE\u2009+\u2009sunitinib vs. sunitinib in the treatment of unresectable advanced renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective study.', 'Clinical Characteristics and Surgical Outcomes of Carotid Body Tumors: Data from the Carotid Paraganglioma Cooperative International Registry (CAPACITY) Group.', 'The focus clinical research in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.']"""

A total of 97 patients with PET-CT scanning and empirically confirmed as serous cavity effusion were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm was applied to register the PET-CT images, and the patients were rolled into a benign effusion group and a malignant effusion group according to the benign and malignant conditions of the serous cavity effusion. Besides, the causes of patients from the two groups were analyzed, and there was a comparison of their physiological conditions. Subsequently, CT values of different KeV, lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium concentrations were measured, and the differences of the above quantitative parameters between benign and malignant serous cavity effusion were compared, as well as the registration results of the clone algorithm. The results showed that the registration time and misalignment times of clonal selection algorithm (13.88, 0) were lower than those of genetic algorithm (18.72, 8). There were marked differences in CT values of 40-60 keV and 130-140 keV between the two groups. The concentrations of lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium in basal substances of the malignant effusion group were obviously higher than the concentrations of the benign effusion group (P < 0.05).

Results:   A total of 162 patients with a median age of 64 years underwent single PM. Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) was performed in 83.9% of cases. Surgical resection was achieved by wedge in 73.5%, segmentectomy in 7.4%, lobectomy in 17.9% and pneumonectomy in 1.2% of cases.

Methods:   Patients with clinically suspected LPNM who underwent nCRT followed by TME + LPND were systematically reviewed and divided into the positive LPN group (n = 15) and the negative LPN group (n = 58). Baseline characteristics, clinicopathological data and survival outcomes were collected and analysed.  Results:   Of the 73 patients undergoing TME + LPND after nCRT, the pathological LPNM rate was 20.5% (15/73). Multivariate analysis showed that a post-nCRT LPN short diameter ≥ 7 mm (OR 49.65; 95% CI 3.98-619.1; P = 0.002) and lymphatic invasion (OR 9.23; 95% CI 1.28-66.35; P = 0.027) were independent risk factors for pathological LPNM. The overall recurrence rate of patients with LPNM was significantly higher than that of patients without LPNM (60.0% vs 27.6%, P = 0.018). Multivariate regression analysis identified that LPNM was an independent risk factor not only for overall survival (OS) (HR 3.82; 95% CI 1.19-12.25; P = 0.024) but also for disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.02-5.14; P = 0.044).

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of standard-dose versus low-dose NOACs in patients with nonvalvular AF and LAAT.  Methods:   Patients with nonvalvular AF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before interventional procedures for the detection of LAAT and treated with NOACs from October 2014 to September 2020 in Ningbo First Hospital were retrospectively screened. The study population was divided into two groups according to the doses of NOACs: standard-dose group (dabigatran 150 mg, twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 mg, once daily) and low-dose group (aged ≥75 years, body weight <50 kg, or creatinine clearance <50 mL/min; dabigatran 110 mg, twice daily; rivaroxaban 15 mg, once daily). Repeated TEE was performed 1, 2, and 3 months later. The rate of LAAT completely resolved and incidence of thromboembolic and major bleeding events were compared between the two groups.  Results:   A total of 24 patients were included, 14 patients in the standard-dose group and 10 in the low-dose group. After 3 months, LAAT was completely resolved in 12 out of 14 (85.7%) and 8 out of 10 (80%) patients treated with standard- and low-dose NOACs, respectively. The rate of LAAT completely resolved was comparable between groups. No thromboembolic or major bleeding events occurred during the follow-up.

To optimize disease prognosis and effectively utilize medical resources, proactive measures must be adopted for patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19. We analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients from seven medical institutions in Tokyo and used mathematical modeling of patient blood test results to quantify and compare the predictive ability of multiple prognostic indicators for the development of severe COVID-19. A machine learning logistic regression model was used to analyze the blood test results of 300 patients. Due to the limited data set, the size of the training group was constantly adjusted to ensure that the results of machine learning were effective (e.g., recognition rate of disease severity > 80%). Lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels were the best prognostic indicators of severe COVID-19.

There was a good correlation between the Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems (Spearman's rho = 0.618, significant at the 0.05 level). Both systems demonstrated a high degree of discrimination when predicting early mortality. The Marshall scoring system had reasonable discrimination (AUC 0.782), and the Rotterdam scoring system had good discrimination (AUC 0.729). Comparing the two CT scoring systems, the Marshall scoring system provided a better positive predictive value (90%) for early mortality than the Rotterdam scoring system (78%).

A predictive model was then built, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess its predictive ability.  Results:   There were significant differences in 13 clinical features between the two groups. Four potential markers were identified. They were age, source of CO, Glasgow Coma Scale score and the initiation of HBOT.

They were followed-up for more than 5 years. The operation times and blood loss were significantly reduced in the K-rod group compared to the PLIF group. At the last follow-up, the clinical outcomes of the K-rod group were improved compared to those of the PLIF group as observed by the VAS score, JOABPEQ, and ODI. Imaging outcomes at the last follow-up indicated that the loss of height in the L3/4 and L5/S1 intervertebral space, the ROM of L3/4 and L5/S1, and the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration in the PLIF group were significantly higher than those in the K-rod group. According to Pfirrmann grading, Modic changes, and UCLA grading, the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration was 55.6% in the PLIF group and 15.4% in the K-rod group. Changes in spino-pelvic parameters between the two groups were as follows: pelvic index remained unchanged, pelvic tilt angle increased, and lumbar lordosis and sacral slope decreased.

Although studies on the seasonality of infection have been conducted in various areas, no study has confirmed the relationship between seasonal temperature and infection after breast reconstruction.  Methods:   From 2008 to 2018, a retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction. Patient demographics, intraoperative data, postoperative data, and temperature information were collected. Temperature differences between cases with and without infection were examined. The differences in the incidence and risk of infection by season were estimated according to the hot season (July to August) and the nonhot season (September to June).  Results:   Of the 460 cases enrolled, 42 cases developed an infection. Among them, 15 (35.71%) cases developed infection during the hot season (P = 0.003). According to the logistic regression model, the risk of infection was 2.639 times higher in the hot season than in the nonhot season (95% confidence interval, 1.282-5.434; P = 0.008). When the temperature was higher than 25°C, the risk of infection increased by 45.2% for every 1°C increase, which was statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.452; 95% confidence interval, 1.198-1.76; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In conclusion, the hot season or average temperatures higher than 25°C increase the risk of infection in patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction. It is essential to focus on skin hygiene during the healing of the incision site.""","""['Kyunghyun Min', 'Seong Su Jeong', 'Hyun Ho Han', 'Eun Key Kim', 'Jin Sup Eom']""","""[' From the Department of Plastic Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Ann Plast Surg""","""['Seasonal Impact on Surgical-Site Infections in Body Contouring Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study of 602 Patients over a Period of 6 Years.', 'Long-term reconstructive outcomes after expander-implant breast reconstruction with serious infectious or wound-healing complications.', 'Inframammary Fold Approach for Second-stage Operation in Expander-Implant Breast Reconstruction.', 'Different types of implants for reconstructive breast surgery.', 'Current status of implant-based breast reconstruction in patients receiving postmastectomy radiation therapy.', 'Climate change and (surgical) health in context.']"""

Materials and methods:   A sample of 16 maxillary first premolars from 8 patients requiring bilateral extractions of the upper first premolars as part of their orthodontic treatment were recruited. A buccally directed continuous force of 150 g, reactivated after 28 days, was applied to the upper first premolar on one side for 8 weeks. On the contralateral first premolar, a buccally directed intermittent force (21 days on, 7 days off) of the same magnitude was applied for the same period. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected at the beginning of the study, 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th week, and at the end of the study to quantify and compare dentin phosphoprotein levels in both groups.  Results:   Dentin phosphoprotein levels showed a higher concentration in the continuous force group than the intermittent force group in week 4 and 8 of sample collection; where the differences were statistically significant (95% CI 0.007-0.14; P < .04) and (95% CI 0.02-0.17; P < .04) respectively. No harm was observed.  Conclusions:   Dentin phosphoprotein was found to be a useful early biomarker to detect and monitor root resorption, showing that the application of an intermittent orthodontic force caused less root resorption than a continuous force.

We introduce a new all-internal 4-anchor flexor tendon repair technique and evaluate outcomes in three clinical cases.  Methods:   In this retrospective case series, we reviewed three patients that sustained an avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon at the distal phalanx. All patients were surgically treated with the four-anchor repair technique. Two titanium anchors were inserted into the distal phalanx and two all-suture anchors were inserted distal to the first set of anchors. The tendon was then attached to these four anchors using a Krackow stitch pattern and the anchors were sown to each other. Active flexion and extension of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joint were measured at 3-month, 12-month, and 5-year follow-up. Postoperative complications were documented.  Results:   All patients achieved excellent clinical outcomes according to assessment criteria. At 3-month follow-up, all patients regained full flexion; two patients had full extension, while one patient was 3 degrees short of full extension. At 12-month follow-up, all patients had full flexion and extension. Five-year follow-up demonstrated the same results with no loss of function, sensation or grip strength. The repairs healed without rupture, and no complications were reported.  Conclusion:   The 4-anchor flexor tendon repair is a viable surgical technique for zone 1 flexor digitorum profundus tendon repair or reconstruction.

Here, we evaluated the prognostic value of various metabolic parameters in baseline and different time points after therapy.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, 51 metastatic melanoma patients, who had received immunotherapy, were included. Patients with baseline and two follow-up 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT studies (3 and 6 months after therapy) were selected. Multiple metabolic parameters and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were extracted and correlated with OS.  Results:   The 3- and 5-year OS rates were 49% and 43.1%, respectively. On baseline 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT, only standardized uptake value corrected for lean body mass (SULmax and SULpeak), as well as most of the TBRs were predictive for 3- and 5-year OS rates. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and most of the TBRs were predictive on both follow-up studies. Also, the changes in values of MTV, TLG and most of the TBRs from the baseline to the 3-month and 6- month follow-up studies were prognostic. On multivariate analysis, all of the most predictive parameters for OS were derived from the 3-month follow-up study. The ratio of TBRmean to the mediastinum was the best factor (cutoff value of 2.15, sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 68.0% for 3-year survival).  Conclusion:   Metabolic parameters derived from 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT are valuable tools for the prediction of 3- and 5-year OS rates in metastatic melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy.

Methods:   From December 2017 to December 2019, the clinical data of 23 acute lower limb ischemia cases treated with Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system were retrospectively analyzed. There were 14 males and 9 females from 53- to 84-year-old patients and the mean age was (69.1±9.1) years. Duration of symptoms was 6 hours to 14 days (median time 7 days). In the study, 8 acute thromboembolism cases and 15 acute thrombosis cases were included (In which, there was one thromboangiitis obliterans case and two in-stent restenosis cases). In 5 cases, the lesions were located above the groin; in 16 cases, the lesions were located below the groin, and in the other 2 cases, the lesions were located both above and below the groin. All the cases were treated with Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system. When residual stenosis was greater than 50%, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was used, and stent was used only when it was necessary. Heparin was used 24 h after the procedure, and after that, antiplatelet agents were used in acute thrombosis cases, and oral anti-coagulants were used in acute thromboembolism cases. Doppler ultrasonography was taken during the follow-up.  Results:   In all the 23 cases, there were 22 successful cases and 1 unsuccessful case, the mean procedure time was (68.2±15.6) min. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used in 18 cases, 7 of which were implanted stents (3 stents were implanted in iliac artery and 4 in superficial femoral artery). There were 3 procedure related complications. The first one was arterial wall injury which resulted in contrast medium extravazation, and in this case, we solved it with prolonged balloon inflation. The second one was distal embolism. We took out the thrombus with guiding catheter. The last one was acute occlusion in a stent, and thrombectomy was applied urgently, and the result was good. Mean hospital stay were (3.6±1.7) days. The ankle brachial index (ABI) increased from 0.25±0.10 to 0.85±0.16 after treatment (t=12.901, P < 0.001). All the patients were followed up for 4.0-28.0 months, and the median time was 12.0 months. One patient stopped antiplatelet agents, which resulted in acute thrombosis 2 months later. Another percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and PTA were taken. In the failed case, the patient suffered amputation above the knee 3 months later and in another case, the patient died of heart failure 8 months after the procedure. Two target lesion restenosis occurred during the follow-up. Because the patients' symptom was not sever, no procedure was taken.  Conclusion:   Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy using Rotarex catheter is safe and effective in treating acute lower limb ischemia. For one side, it can restore blood flow to the affected limbs quickly, and for the other, it has the characteristics of minimally invasive and good repeatability.

The ROC curves were used to analyze the efficiency of the different CCT diagnostic criteria for diagnosing APA.  Results:   Compared with the PA group, the duration of hypertension was shorter, the incidence of hypokalemia was higher, and the average serum potassium level was lower when APA was diagnosed. There were no significant differences in blood pressure level, gender, serum sodium and body mass index between the two groups. Compared with PA population, APA group had higher PAC and ARR whether before or after the CCT, but lower plasma renin concentration (PRC). In APA patients, the mean degree of PAC declined after CCT was approximately 5.7%, but 5% with that of PA. As for diagnosing, ARR before or after CCT had diagnostic value for APA, in which the ARR cut-off point was 7.12, which yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 35.85% and 77.78%. The cut-off point of ARR after CCT was 4.23, with a sensitivity of 71.43% and specificity of 62.22%. For the diagnosis, the ARR before and after CCT were of no significant difference. However, the diagnostic specificity of ARR>7.12 combined with hypokalemia was up to 80%.  Conclusion:   ARR before or after CCT have clinical value for the diagnosis of APA from PA, when combined with hypokalemia yielded high specificity.""","""['B Dong', 'X W Ma', 'X H Guo', 'Y Gao', 'J Q Zhang']""","""[' Department of Endocrinology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['The Diagnostic Value of Captopril Challenge Test for Primary Aldosteronism.', 'Efficacy of Screening and Confirmatory Tests of Primary Aldosteronism in Diagnosing Aldosterone Producing Adenoma.', 'The captopril challenge test for diagnosing primary Aldosteronism in a Chinese population.', 'Detecting and treating primary aldosteronism: primary aldosteronism.', 'Screening tests and diagnostic examinations of hypertensives for primary aldosteronism.']"""

Methods:   Anti-MDA5 antibodies positive patients with DM who were hospitalized in the Department of Rheumatology of China-Japan Friendship Hospital from 2013 to 2018 were involved in this study. Demographic information, clinical, laboratory and imaging data were retrospectively collected. ELISA was used to detect the serum and BALF levels of YKL-40. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum YKL-40 for pulmonary injury.Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was confirmed by chest high-resolution CT (HRCT). RP-ILD was defined as progressive respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and hypoxemia within 3 months, and/or deterioration of interstitial changes or appearace of new pulmonary interstitial lesions on chest HRCT. Pulmonary infection was considered as positive pathogens detected in qualified sputum, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung biopsy specimens.  Results:   A total of 168 anti-MDA5-positive DM patients including 108 females and 60 males were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 154 had ILD, and 66(39.3%) of them presented RP-ILD. Seventy patients with pulmonary infection were confirmed by etiology. In the patients with RP-ILD, 39 (59.1%) of them were complicated with pulmonary infection. While only 31 cases(30.4%) had pulmonary infection in the non-RP-ILD patients. The incidence of pulmonary infection in the patients with RP-ILD was significantly higher than that of those with non-RP-ILD (P < 0.001). The serum YKL-40 levels in the RP-ILD patients with pulmonary infection were the highest compared with RP-ILD without pulmonary infection, non-RP-ILD with pulmonary infection and non-RP-ILD without pulmonary infection groups among all the patients [83 (42-142) vs. 42 (21-91) vs. 43 (24-79) vs. 38 (22-69), P < 0.01].The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of serum YKL-40 in the diagnosis of RP-ILD complicated with pulmonary infection were 75%, 67%, and 0.72, respectively.

Clinical data including demographic features, clinical manifestations, organ involvement, laboratory findings, radiological results, pathology, treatments and outcomes were collected retrospectively.  Results:   Among the 10 IgG4-RD patients complicated with CNS involvement, 6 cases manifested as pituitary involvement and 4 cases manifested as dural involvement. Only 2 patients had nervous system involvement alone, while the left patients were complicated with other organ involvement besides nervous system. Half of the patients presented nervous system involvement as the initial manifestation, and the main symptoms of nervous system included polydipsia, polyuria, headache, decreased vision and so on. In the laboratory examination, the serum IgG4 level was increased in 9 cases (90.0%), and the total serum IgE was increased in 7 cases (87.5%). At the same time, their IgG, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were increased, while complement (C) 3 and C4 were decreased in some patients. Eight patients underwent tissue biopsies in different parts, the pathological examination showed a large number of lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration, accompanied by fibrous tissue proliferation in part. All the patients were treated with glucocorticoids, and 8 cases (80%) were given immunosuppressants at the same time, and 3 cases were treated with rituximab when they expe-rienced disease relapse. As a result, 2 cases (20%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 8 cases (80%) achieved partial remission (PR). The median follow-up time was 13.5 months, and 4 cases relapsed.  Conclusion:   Pituitary and dura are common affected organs of IgG4-RD with CNS involvement.

However, it may be noted that diagnosis such as pulmonary embolism and connective tissue diseases can result in an exudative pleural effusion where a pleural biopsy can yield nonspecific results. Medical thoracoscopy (MT) is a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthesia or moderate sedation with excellent yield and favorable safety profile. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of MT for exudative pleural effusions after employing a rigid diagnostic algorithm. The study was undertaken to ascertain the yield of MT in establishing the diagnosis in diagnosis of exudative pleural effusions, to find out the relative contribution of pleural tuberculosis (TB) as a cause of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion, to describe the etiology of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion in patients undergoing MT and to determine the correlation between pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels and TB pleuritis in patients undergoing MT.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study. Patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion were included in the study. MT was performed with semirigid thoracoscope (Olympus LTF 160) under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. Gross appearance and ADA level of pleural fluid were noted. Pleural biopsy material was subjected to histopathology examination and culture for mycobacteria along with cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test for TB. The yield of MT for establishing the etiology of pleural effusion and the relative contribution of tuberculous pleuritis as a cause of undiagnosed pleural effusion was ascertained. Correlation of pleural fluid ADA levels was done with a final diagnosis of TB pleuritis in patients undergoing MT.  Results:   Twenty-five patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion underwent thoracoscopy of which 16 were male and 9 were female. MT was able to establish the diagnosis in all cases, providing a diagnostic yield of 100%. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens yielded a diagnosis of malignant involvement of pleura in 10 patients and granulomatous pleuritis consistent with TB in 14 patients. Pleural TB contributed to 60% of undiagnosed pleural effusions in the present study. The mean ADA value among those who turned positive was 56.338 and 35.300 among those who turned negative using genexpert, which was found to be statistically significant. A value of 31 IU/L showed a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 99.8% and hence can be taken as a cut off value for the diagnosis of pleural TB based on receiver-operating characteristic analysis.  Conclusion:   TB contributed to 60% of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions in the present study. MT had 100% yield in the diagnosis of undiagnosed exudative effusions.

The results may assist in surgical decision-making and enable more effective and safer implementation of cervical arthroplasty.  Materials and methods:   A total of 125 patients who were treated with CDA between 2006 and 2019 were assessed. Radiological measurements and clinical outcomes included the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) myelopathy score assessment preoperatively and at ≥2 years of follow-up.  Results:   The mean follow-up period was 38 months (range, 25-114 months). Radiographic data demonstrated mobility at both the index and adjacent levels, with no signs of hypermobility at an adjacent level. There was a non-significant loss of cervical global motion and range of motion (ROM) of the functional spinal unit at the operated level, as well as the upper and lower adjacent disc levels, compared to preoperative status. The cervical global and segmental angle significantly increased. Postoperative neck VAS, NDI, and JOA scores showed meaningful improvements after one- and two-level CDA. We experienced a 29.60% incidence of heterotrophic ossification and a 3.20% reoperation rate due to cervical instability, implant subsidence, or osteolysis.  Conclusion:   CDA is an effective surgical technique for optimizing clinical outcomes and radiological results. In particular, the preservation of cervical ROM with an artificial prosthesis at adjacent and index levels and improvement in cervical global alignment could reduce revision rates due to adjacent segment degeneration.""","""['Jun Jae Shin', 'Kwang-Ryeol Kim', 'Dong Wuk Son', 'Dong Ah Shin', 'Seong Yi', 'Keung-Nyun Kim', 'Do-Heum Yoon', 'Yoon Ha']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University School of Medicine, Yongin, Korea.', "" Department of Neurosurgery, International St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea."", ' Department of Neurosurgery, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Korea.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Spine and Spinal Cord Institute, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' POSTECH Biotech Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea. hayoon@yuhs.ac.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Yonsei Med J""","""['Is cervical disc arthroplasty good for congenital cervical stenosis?', 'Clinical and radiographic outcomes of cervical disc arthroplasty with Prestige-LP Disc: a minimum 6-year follow-up study.', 'Cervical kinematics and radiological changes after Discover artificial disc replacement versus fusion.', 'Cervical disc arthroplasty: What we know in 2020 and a literature review.', 'High prevalence of heterotopic ossification after cervical disc arthroplasty: outcome and intraoperative findings following explantation of 22 cervical disc prostheses.']"""

However, accurate diagnosis of PTs from the current preoperative examinations is unsatisfactory.  Methods:   This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. A total of 73 patients with PTs, including 55 benign and 18 malignant tumours confirmed by surgical pathology, were enrolled. All patients underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). The signal uniformity and capsule on T2WI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DWI, semi-quantitative parameter time-intensity curve (TIC) pattern, and quantitative parameters including transfer constant (Ktrans), extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve), wash-out constant (Kep) calculated from DCE-MRI, and intratumoural susceptibility signal (ITSS) obtained from SWI were assessed and compared between benign and malignant PTs. Logistic regression analysis was used to select the predictive parameters for the classification of benign and malignant parotid gland tumours, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate their diagnostic performance.  Results:   Malignant PTs tended to exhibit a type C TIC pattern, whereas benign tumours tended to be type A and B (p < 0.001). Benign PTs had less ITSS than malignant tumours (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that ADC, Ve, and ITSS were predictors of tumour classification. ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of ADC, Ve, ITSS, and ADC combined with Ve were 0.623, 0.615, 0.826, and 0.782, respectively, in differentiating between malignant and benign PTs. When ITSS was added, the AUCs of ADC, Ve, and ADC combined with Ve increased to 0.882, 0.848, and 0.930, respectively.

Methods:   From 2010 to 2020 585 HCC nodules treated with RFA were prospectively collected. Ablation Difficulty Score (ADS) was built-up according to clinical and radiological factors related to failure ablation identified by Cox-logistic regression analysis. The study population was stratified in low risk (ADS 0), intermediate risk (ADS 1), and high risk (ADS ≥ 2) of failure ablation.  Results:   Overall ablation success rate was 85.5%.

We employed the Pantograph investigational device that haptically couples partners movements while providing cursor feedback, and we measured the amount and speed of learning to test a prevailing hypothesis: dyads with no experience learn faster than an experienced person coupled with a novice. We found significant straightening of movements for dyads in terms of amount of learning (2.662±0.102 cm and 2.576±0.024 cm for the novice-novice and novice-experienced groups) at rapid rates (time constants of 17.83 ± 2.85 and 18.17.17±6.72 movements), which was nearly half the learning time as solo individuals' studies. However, we found no differences between the novice-novice and experienced-novice groups, though retrospectively our power was only 3 percent. This pilot study demonstrates new opportunities to investigate the advantages of partner-facilitated learning with solely haptic communication which and can lead to insights on control in human physical interactions and can guide the design of future human-robot-human interaction systems.""","""['Mattia Demasi', 'Adriano Gendy', 'Domen Novak', 'Kyle Reed', 'James L Patton']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Human-Human connected dyads learning a visuomotor rotation in a movement tracking task.', 'Multiple motor learning strategies in visuomotor rotation.', 'Task-specific internal models for kinematic transformations.', 'Small forces that differ with prior motor experience can communicate movement goals during human-human physical interaction.', 'Haptic Coupling in Dyads Improves Motor Learning in a Simple Force Field.']"""

The utility of this procedure for DO diagnosis, however, is limited by the use of physician observations of bladder contractions and patient reported filling sensations. Although a number of preclinical and clinical studies have observed and developed methods to characterize bladder pressure dynamics, these techniques have not been scaled for routine clinical application. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an awake large animal model to characterize bladder pressure signals from cystometry as bladder pressure spectra and quantify changes in spectra during bladder filling. Two adult female sheep were trained for quiet catheterization in a minimally supportive sling and underwent multiple awake and limited anesthetized cystometry tests. In each test, bladder pressure was measured during continuous filling or with filling that included periods of no filling (constant volume). A Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT)-based algorithm was then used to quantify changes in pre-voiding bladder pressure spectra. Changes in Spectral Power (SP) and Weighted Average Frequency (WAF) were calculated during filling. To visualize temporal changes in bladder pressure frequencies during filling, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was also applied to cystometry data. Results showed that a significant increase in SP and decrease in WAF were both associated with bladder filling. However, during awake constant volume tests, SP significantly increased while changes in WAF were nonsignificant. Anesthetized tests demonstrated comparable values to awake tests for WAF while SP was considerably reduced. CWT facilitated visualization of spectral changes associated with SP and WAF as well as apparent non-voiding contractions during awake and anesthetized volume tests.Clinical Relevance-Bladder pressure spectra during cystometry are detectable in sheep and the changes during filling are similar to those observed in human retrospective clinical data. Sheep cystometry may be a valuable testbed for establishing and testing quantitative pressure spectra for use as a clinical diagnostic tool.""","""['Bhaskar Ravishankar', 'Ranveer M S Vasdev', 'Gerald W Timm', 'Dwight E Nelson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Objective Quantification of Detrusor Overactivity Using Spectral Measures of Cystometry Data.', 'Continuous uroflow cystometry in the urethane-anesthetized mouse.', 'Evidence of central modulation of bladder compliance during filling phase.', 'Recommendations for the urodynamic examination in the investigation of non-neurological female urinary incontinence.', 'Cystometry.']"""

The purpose of this study was to construct and validate a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)-based radiomics signature to discriminate between high and low expression status of PD-L1.  Methods:   A total of 179 HNSCC patients who underwent immunohistochemical examination of tumor PD-L1 expression at one of two centers were enrolled in this study and divided into a training set (n = 122; 55 high PD-L1 expression and 67 low PD-L1 expression) and an external validation set (n = 57; 26 high PD-L1 expression and 31 low PD-L1 expression). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select the key features for a CECT-image-based radiomics signature. The performance of the radiomics signature was assessed using receiver operating characteristics analysis.  Results:   Six features were finally selected to construct the radiomics signature. The performance of the radiomics signature in the discrimination between high and low PD-L1 expression status was good in both the training and validation sets, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.889 and 0.834 for the training and validation sets, respectively.

Materials and methods:   A total of 147 patients with TNBC who underwent NAC between January 2009 and December 2018 were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathologic data were collected, and the differences between the recurrent and nonrecurrent patients were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets. The training set consisted of 104 patients (recurrence: 22, nonrecurrence: 82), and the testing set consisted of 43 patients (recurrence: 9, nonrecurrence: 34). To establish the radiomics prediction model, we used a deep learning segmentation model to automatically segment tumor areas on dynamiccontrast-enhanced-MRI images of pre- and post-NAC magnetic resonance examinations. Radiomics features were then extracted from the tumor areas. Three MRI radiomics models were developed in the training set: a radiomics model based on pre-NAC MRI features (model 1), a radiomics model based on post-NAC MRI features (model 2), and a radiomics model based on both pre- and post-NAC MRI features (model 3). A clinical model for predicting systemic recurrence was built in the training set using independent clinical prediction factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the radiomics and clinical models.  Results:   The clinical model yielded areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.747 in the training set and 0.737 in the testing set in terms of predicting systemic recurrence. Models 1, 2, and 3 yielded AUCs of 0.879, 0.91, and 0.963 in the training set and 0.814, 0.802, and 0.933 in the testing set, respectively, in terms of predicting systemic recurrence. All of the radiomics models had achieved higher AUCs than the clinical model in the testing set. DeLong test was used to compare the AUCs between the models and indicated that the predictive performance of model 3 was better than the clinical model, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The radiomics models built based on the combination of pre- and post-NAC MRI features showed good performance in predicting whether patients with TNBC will have systemic recurrence within 3 years post-NAC. This can help us non-invasively identify which patients are at high risk of recurrence post-NAC, so that we can strengthen follow-up and treatment of these patients.

However, warfarin is still the agent of choice for preventing thromboembolic events in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). In this case report, we explore the outcome of using apixaban in a patient with an LVAD. CASE REPORT A 56-year-old woman with morbid obesity and stage D congestive heart failure status after HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) placement 2 years prior, who was on long-term anticoagulation with apixaban after failure of warfarin therapy, presented to the Emergency Department with 2 months of worsening fatigue, dark urine, and 1 day of low-flow alarms from her HVAD. Laboratory and radiographic data were consistent with a diagnosis of pump thrombosis. She underwent pump exchange and was started on a heparin drip. Genetic testing for warfarin resistance was negative. Detailed history-taking revealed that the failure to maintain a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) was likely due to dietary factors. She was re-challenged with warfarin, and a therapeutic INR level was reached shortly after initiation. She was later discharged on a stable dose of warfarin and remained in a good clinical state without any major adverse events at the 1-year follow-up.

Extended cytoreduction (ECR) was defined as surgery involving the bowel, liver, diaphragm, bladder, stomach, or spleen. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to analyze patient and hospital demographics related to ECR, and trends were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test.  Results:   Of the estimated 79,400 patients undergoing ovarian cancer surgery, 22% received ECR. Decreased adjusted odds of ECR were found in patients with lower Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores (OR 0.61, p<0.001 for ECI 2, versus ECI≥3) or residence outside the top income quartile (OR 0.71, p<0.001 for Q1, versus Q4), and increased odds were seen at hospitals with high ovarian cancer surgical volume (OR 1.25, p<0.001, versus low volume). From 2013 to 2017, there was a decrease in the proportion of cases with extended procedures (19% to 15%, p<0.001). There were significant decreases in the proportion of cases with small bowel, colon, and rectosigmoid resections (p<0.001). Patients who underwent ECR were more likely treated at a high surgical volume hospital (37% vs 31%, p<0.001) over the study period.

In most studies, mitomycin-C is administered immediately after surgery to prevent corneal opacification (haze), which is a significant complication of photorefractive keratectomy in general. However, there is evidence that adjuvant mitomycin-C induces endothelial cytotoxicity. Moreover, a recent study showed that omitting adjuvant mitomycin-C did not increase haze in low-moderate myopia. The present case-series study examined the efficacy, safety, and haze rates of eyes with high myopia that underwent ASLA-SCHWIND TransPRK without adjuvant mitomycin-C.  Methods:   All consecutive eyes with high myopia (≤-6 D) that were treated in 2018-2020 with the SCHWIND Amaris 500E® TransPRK excimer laser without adjuvant mitomycin-C in a tertiary-care hospital (France) and were followed up for 6 months were identified. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), and spherical equivalent (SE) were recorded before and after surgery. Postoperative haze was graded using the 4-grade Fantes scale. Efficacy rate (frequency of eyes with 6-month UCVA ≤0.1 logMAR), safety rate (frequency of eyes that lost <2 BSCVA lines), predictability (frequency of eyes with 6-month SE equal to target SE±0.5 D), efficacy index (mean UCVA at 6 months/preoperative BSCVA), and safety index (BSCVA at 6 months/preoperative BSCVA) were computed.  Results:   Sixty-nine eyes (38 patients) were included. Mean preoperative and 6-month SE were -7.44 and -0.05 D, respectively. Mean 6-month UCVA and BSCVA were 0.00 and -0.02 logMAR, respectively. Efficacy rate and index were 95.7% and 1.08, respectively. Safety rate and index were 95.7% and 1.13, respectively. Predictability was 85.5%. Grade 3-4 haze never arose.

Results:   A significant (p < 0.005) difference was found between the diagnostic accuracy values of imaging evaluation performed by Group 3 using Method 1 (63%) and Method 2 (89%); of note, the accuracy of Method 2 by Group 3 was also significantly (p < 0.005) higher compared to that of both Methods 1 (46%) and 2 (63%) by Group 2 as well as to that of the routine evaluation by Group 1 (60%).  Conclusions:   The qualitative identification of at least two abnormal MR signs (Method 2) represents an accurate method for predicting PAS in patients with PP particularly when this method was used by more experienced radiologists; thus, imaging expertise and methodology is required for this purpose.""","""['Simone Maurea', 'Francesco Verde', 'Pier Paolo Mainenti', 'Luigi Barbuto', 'Francesca Iacobellis', 'Valeria Romeo', 'Raffaele Liuzzi', 'Giorgio Raia', 'Gianfranco De Dominicis', 'Claudio Santangelo', 'Luigia Romano', 'Arturo Brunetti']""","""[' Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', ' Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.

Method:   Patients with MTC who were treated via primary surgery between January 2015 and May 2020 and who had undergone preoperative SWE and ultrasound (US) examinations in the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively studied. The relationships between lymphatic status and the clinicopathological and imaging characteristics were evaluated. Afterwards, associations between lateral cervical LNM and SWE parameters, as well as sex, age, invasive size, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), preoperative calcitonin levels, and US features were assessed by using multivariable logistic regressions.  Results:   A total of 76 patients (31 men and 45 women, 48.1 ± 11.8 years) were evaluated. The following factors demonstrated significant associations with lateral cervical LNM: the male sex (P = 0.015), an age ≤ 35 years (P = 0.049), an invasive size > 1.0 cm (P = 0.028), ETE (P = 0.005), a preoperative calcitonin level > 60 pg/ml (P < 0.001), irregular shape on the US (P = 0.001), the presence of a non-circumscribed margin on the US (P = 0.009), an Emax > 66 kPa (P < 0.001), an Emean > 37.5 kPa (P < 0.001), and an ER > 1.65 (P = 0.002). In the multivariable analysis, an age ≤ 35 years (P = 0.049), a preoperative calcitonin level > 60 pg/ml (P = 0.004), an irregular shape on the US (P = 0.036), and an Emax > 66 kPa (P = 0.011) maintained independent significance.

In procedures with equipment variability, surgical case length may be increased due to the need to procure items intraoperatively. We hypothesized that use of standardized huddle tools listing necessary equipment would be associated with a shortened case duration in MLB.  Methods:   As part of a quality improvement initiative at our academic, tertiary care pediatric hospital, a standardized huddle sheet was created that listed options of equipment for MLB. Listed items included telescope/bronchoscope size, laryngoscope selection, interventional equipment, suspension, microscopes, and topical medications. The tool was completed by otolaryngology and shared with the circulating nurse at the beginning of the day so equipment needs could be anticipated. The tool was introduced to staff in November 2017 and to trainees in February 2018. To assess intervention impact, monthly median surgical case duration and room turnover time were retrospectively tracked using control chart analysis from March 2017 to June 2019.  Results:   At baseline, the centerline case duration was 49 min. Two months following introduction of the huddle sheet to trainees, the centerline duration decreased to 43 min. This change was sustained throughout the period studied. No changes in room turnover time were observed during this period.  Conclusions:   Standardized huddle tool use prior to MLB was associated with a median decrease of 6 min of operating room time without a change in operating room turnover time. Use of similar tools in procedures with significant equipment variability may be beneficial.""","""['Jennifer Lavin', 'Austin Walker', 'Dana M Thompson', 'Taher Valika', 'Roderick C Jones', 'Reba Mathew', 'Kent Brave', 'Jonathan Ida']""","""["" Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Ann & Robert H.

These interventions should ideally be applied during critical windows like pregnancy. Perinatal environmental health education interventions may help to reduce EDC exposure during pregnancy.  Methods/design:   PREVED (Pregnancy, PreVention, Endocrine Disruptors) is an open-label randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of environmental health education intervention on EDC exposure during pregnancy. Inclusion, consent, and randomization take place during the first trimester. The participants are randomly allocated into three groups: (i) control group (information leaflet on EDCs), (ii) intervention group in neutral location (information leaflet and workshops in a meeting room), and (iii) intervention group in contextualized location (information leaflet and workshops in a real apartment). Workshops are organized between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Main outcome is the percentage of participants who reported consuming manufactured/industrial food. Secondary outcomes are as follows: (i) psycho-social dimensions, (ii) EDC concentrations in urine, (iii) EDC concentration in colostrum, and (iv) percentage of participants who reported consuming paraben-free personal care products.  Discussion:   PREVED is a ground-breaking intervention research project dedicated to perinatal environmental health education that aims to identify pollutant sources in daily life and to offer accessible and realistic alternative solutions, by promoting the sharing of know-how and experience in a positive and non-alarmist approach.

Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) provides a dynamic assessment of the upper airway and visualizes anatomical site and cause of airway obstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MDO on tongue-based airway obstruction found by DISE within a non-isolated patient population with severe upper airway obstruction (UAO). Furthermore, we aimed to assess the additional value of DISE in clinical decision making by correlating DISE findings to functional airway outcomes after MDO.  Methods:   Findings on DISE in children who underwent MDO were retrospectively gathered and evaluated. According to DISE findings, severity of tongue-based obstruction was scored using a 4-step classification similar to the one that is used by Bravo et al.. Intubation conditions were scored according to the Cormack Lehane score (CLS). Pre-and postoperative DISE findings were compared and correlated with functional airway outcomes following MDO.  Results:   In 19 out of 28 MDO procedures, both a pre-and postoperative DISE was available. Tongue-based obstruction scores improved in 13 procedures, which correlated to a functional improvement in seven. Postoperative tongue-based obstruction differed significantly between patients with successful MDO and patients treated unsuccessfully (2.00 ((Interquartile range (IQR) 1.00-2.00) vs. 3.00 (IQR 2.00-4.00), p = 0.028), whereas this difference was not significant for the CLS (1.00 (IQR 1.00-1.50) vs. 2.00 (IQR 1.00-4.00), p = 0.066). If no improvement of tongue-based obstruction was seen, MDO is very unlikely to be successful on the functional airway.  Conclusions:   DISE provides information on the site and nature of airway obstruction and can visualize the effect of MDO on the severity of tongue-based airway obstruction. Therefore, it can be of additional value in understanding the differences in functional airway outcomes after MDO and aids in deciding appropriate and targeted treatment. Hence, standardized use of DISE, in addition to the clinical assessment of mandibular position and a polysomnography, during MDO management is highly recommended.""","""['Pleun P J M van der Plas', 'Koen F M Joosten', 'Eppo B Wolvius', 'Maarten J Koudstaal', 'Irene M J Mathijssen', 'Marieke F van Dooren', 'Bas Pullens']""","""["" Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used in clinical routine for diagnosis of PE. Many pulmonary obstruction scores were proposed to aid in stratifying clinical course of PE. The purpose of the present study was to compare common pulmonary obstruction scores in PE in regard of time efficiency and interreader agreement based upon a representative patient sample.  Methods:   Overall, 50 patients with acute PE were included in this single center, retrospective analysis. Two readers scored the CT images blinded to each other and assessed the scores proposed by Mastora et al., Qanadli et al., Ghanima et al. and Kirchner et al. The required time was assessed of each reading for scoring.  Results:   For reader 1, Mastora score took the longest time duration, followed by Kirchner score, Qanadli score and finally Ghanima score (every test, p<0.0001). The interreader variability was excellent for all scores with no significant differences between them. In the Spearman's correlation analysis strong correlations were identified between the scores of Mastora, Qanadli and Kirchner, whereas Ghanima score was only moderately correlated with the other scores.

Methods:   Patients with treatment-naïve PCV were included and underwent anti-VEGF therapy. Mean choroidal thickness (MCT), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), and PED volume measurements were obtained before and after treatment.  Results:   Thirty-four treatment-naïve PCV eyes from 33 patients were included. The PED volume decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). The MCT decreased from 223.0 ± 79.6 µm at baseline to 210.9 ± 76.2 µm after treatment (P < 0.001). The CVI at baseline was 0.599 ± 0.024, and the CVI after treatment was 0.602 ± 0.023 (P = 0.16).

Conclusions:   In treatment-naïve eyes with PCV, the decreases in PED volumes were correlated with the decrease in MCT and the increase in CVI measurements. We propose that, at baseline, the PCV lesions serve as high-volume arteriovenous shunts between choroidal arterial and venous circulation, causing transudation into the choroidal stroma. We propose that, after treatment, the blood flow through the vascular shunt is reduced, the excess stromal transudation is resorbed, and the exudation from the neovascular lesion is reduced, resulting in thinning of the choroid, resolution of the PEDs, and an increase in the CVI due to the resorption of excess choroidal transudation.""","""['Mengxi Shen', 'Hao Zhou', 'Kiyoung Kim', 'Qiyu Bo', 'Jie Lu', 'Rita Laiginhas', 'Xiaoshuang Jiang', 'Quan Yan', 'Prashanth Iyer', 'Omer Trivizki', 'Yingying Shi', 'Luis de Sisternes', 'Mary K Durbin', 'William Feuer', 'Giovanni Gregori', 'Ruikang K Wang', 'Xiaodong Sun', 'Fenghua Wang', 'Seung-Young Yu', 'Philip J Rosenfeld']""","""[' Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, United States.', ' Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ' Research and Development, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, California, United States.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci""","""['Effectiveness of polypoidal lesion-selective photodynamic therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.', 'Differentiating Exudative Macular Degeneration and Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Using OCT B-Scan.', 'Appearance of Polypoidal Lesions in Patients With Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomographic Angiography.', 'Non-ICGA treatment criteria for Suboptimal Anti-VEGF Response for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy: APOIS PCV Workgroup Report 2.', 'Current Management of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.']"""

Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with statistical significance of survival differences assessed using the log-rank test.  Results:   Median age was 66 (range, 42-84) years. Performance status (PS) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was 0-1 in 79/111 patients. The majority of patients (89.2%) had adenocarcinoma histology. At a median follow-up of 47.4 months, median progression-free (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) was 4.9 (95%CI, 2.8-10.0) and 11.9 (95%CI, 8.2-14.4) months, respectively. Forty-six (43.4%) patients with BM NSCLC underwent first- or further-line therapy with ICIs: 28 (60.8%) received nivolumab, 9 (19.6%) pembrolizumab, and 9 (19.6%) atezolizumab. Of the 46 patients treated with ICIs, 30 (65.2%) underwent BTT: 24 (80.0%) with zoledronate and 6 (20.0%) with denosumab. The ICI-alone group had an mOS of 15.8 months [95%CI, 8.2-not evaluable (NE)] vs. 21.8 months (95%CI, 14.5-not evaluable) for the ICI plus BTT group and 7.5 (95%CI, 6.1-10.9) months for the group receiving other treatments (p < 0.001). NLR ≤5 had a positive impact on OS.  Conclusion:   BTT appears to have a synergistic effect when used in combination with ICIs, improving patient survival.""","""['Alberto Bongiovanni', 'Flavia Foca', 'Jessica Menis', 'Stefania Luigia Stucci', 'Fabrizio Artioli', 'Valentina Guadalupi', 'Maria Rosachiara Forcignanò', 'Manuela Fantini', 'Federica Recine', 'Laura Mercatali', 'Chiara Spadazzi', 'Marco Angelo Burgio', 'Valentina Fausti', 'Anna Miserocchi', 'Toni Ibrahim']""","""[' Osteoncology and Rare Tumors Center (CDO-TR), IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Meldola, Italy.', ' Unit of Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Meldola, Italy.', ' Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ' Medical Oncology Department, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', ' Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata (AOUI) di Verona, Verona, Italy.', ' Medical Oncology Unit, Policlinico Hospital of Bari Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology University of Bari ""A.

We obtained spleen volume (SV) by magnetic resonance examination, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of platelet count/spleen volume ratio (PSVR) and spleen volume in predicting EV in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis. Methods: This study was a diagnostic accuracy experiment and retrospective, 199 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis who met the criteria were selected as the research subjects. All patients were collected blood samples in the morning on an empty stomach within 2 days, and related indicators were tested. Within 10 days, they received electronic gastroscopy and abdominal magnetic resonance examination. According to the Child-Pugh score, the patients were divided into groups with or without EV and with or without high-risk esophageal varices (HRV), then statistical analysis of the two groups was performed.  Results:   The area under the curve (AUC) of PSVR in predicting EV or HRV in each group (85.5%-92.6%) was higher than PSDR, SV, spleen diameter, and platelet count. The AUC of PSDR in diagnosing HRV was higher than SV, and the AUC of SV in diagnosing EV was higher than PSDR, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). In Child-Pugh A patients, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed PSVR could be a predictor of HRV (P<0.05), SV was a reliable predictor of EV (P<0.05).  Conclusion:   PSVR is better than PSDR, spleen diameter, platelet count in predicting EV; in the absence of serological results, SV could be used instead of PSDR.

Studies assessing molecular biomarkers in bladder cancer have generally focused on UC, and genomic data of NSR-SCCUB is limited. We aim to provide additional insight into the molecular underpinnings of this rare entity.  Methods:   NSR-SCCUB patients were identified retrospectively at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 2002 and 2017. Demographics, disease characteristics, therapeutic approaches, and outcomes were collected. Tissue samples were interrogated using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (ThermoFisher). Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the disease-free survival and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Overall, 11 patients with NSR-SCCUB were identified between 2002 and 2017 with adequate tissue samples. Median age was 71 years (45-86), predominantly male (63.6%). At time of diagnosis, 9 patients (81.8%) had muscle-invasive disease, 1 (9.1%) had non-muscle invasive, and 1 (9.1%) had advanced disease. Nine (81.8%) patients had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph nodes dissection. Eight (72.7%) patients had pT3 or pT4 with N0, and 5 (45.5%) were grade 3. Median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI 7.7-17.2 months). Single nucleotide variants or insertion/deletions were identified in TP53, TERT, PIK3CA, PTEN, CREBBP, FBXW7, and FGFR3. Amplifications were found in CCND1, and EGFR.  Conclusions:   NSR-SCCUB has potentially actionable genomic alterations with anticancer agents and many of these aberrations are also seen in UC.

Method:   Our retrospective study included 48 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced U-HRCT. Quantitative analyses were performed to compare image noise of U-HRCT between deep-learning reconstruction (DLR) and other three methods (filtered back projection: FBP, hybrid iterative reconstruction: Hybrid-IR, and Model-based iterative reconstruction: MBIR). The mean overall image quality scores were also compared between the DLR and other three methods. In addition, the mean conspicuity scores for the three-layered structure of the gastric wall at five regions were compared between C-HRCT and U-HRCT.  Results:   The mean noise of U-HRCT with DLR was significantly lower than that with the other three methods (P < 0.001).

However, these practices encompass a wide range of activities and determining which type, intensity or duration of activity is effective at improving student exam performance has been elusive. To address this shortcoming, we used a previously validated classroom observation tool, Practical Observation Rubric to Assess Active Learning (PORTAAL) to measure the presence, intensity, and duration of evidence-based teaching practices in a retrospective study of upper and lower division biology courses. We determined the cognitive challenge of exams by categorizing all exam questions obtained from the courses using Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Domains. We used structural equation modeling to correlate the PORTAAL practices with exam performance while controlling for cognitive challenge of exams, students' GPA at start of the term, and students' demographic factors. Small group activities, randomly calling on students or groups to answer questions, explaining alternative answers, and total time students were thinking, working with others or answering questions had positive correlations with exam performance. On exams at higher Bloom's levels, students explaining the reasoning underlying their answers, students working alone, and receiving positive feedback from the instructor also correlated with increased exam performance. Our study is the first to demonstrate a correlation between the intensity or duration of evidence-based PORTAAL practices and student exam performance while controlling for Bloom's level of exams, as well as looking more specifically at which practices correlate with performance on exams at low and high Bloom's levels. This level of detail will provide valuable insights for faculty as they prioritize changes to their teaching. As we found that multiple PORTAAL practices had a positive association with exam performance, it may be encouraging for instructors to realize that there are many ways to benefit students' learning by incorporating these evidence-based teaching practices.""","""['Sungmin Moon', 'Mallory A Jackson', 'Jennifer H Doherty', 'Mary Pat Wenderoth']""","""[' Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""[""Biology in bloom: implementing Bloom's Taxonomy to enhance student learning in biology."", 'PORTAAL: A Classroom Observation Tool Assessing Evidence-Based Teaching Practices for Active Learning in Large Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Classes.', 'Association Between Dental Student-Developed Exam Questions and Learning at Higher Cognitive Levels.', 'Redesigning a course to help students achieve higher-order cognitive thinking skills: from goals and mechanics to student outcomes.', ""Exploring Two-Year College Biology Instructors' Preferences around Teaching Strategies and Professional Development."", 'Fidelity of Implementation as a Guiding Framework for Transitioning Research-Based Instructional Practices from On Site to Online.']"""

Native T1 mapping using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging can characterize the myocardium, but accumulating evidence indicates that T1 values of the septum or ventricular insertion points do not have predictive potential in pulmonary arterial hypertension. We aimed to elucidate whether native T1 values of the right ventricular free wall (RVT1) can predict poor outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 30 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (median age, 45 years; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 41±13 mmHg) and 16 healthy controls (median age, 43 years) who underwent native T1 mapping. RVT1 was obtained from the inferior right ventricular free wall during end systole.  Results:   Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension had significantly higher native RVT1 than did controls (1384±74 vs. 1217±57 ms, p<0.001). Compared with T1 values of the septum or ventricular insertion points, RVT1 correlated better with the effective right ventricular elastance index (R = -0.53, p = 0.003), ventricular-arterial uncoupling (R = 0.46, p = 0.013), and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels (R = 0.65, p<0.001). Moreover, the baseline RVT1 was an accurate predictor of the reduced right ventricular ejection fraction at the 12-month follow-up (delta -3%).

The supply chain to deliver these medicines is complex, with fragmented data systems and limited visibility on performance. This study empirically evaluates the impact of an online supply chain performance measurement system, ""NTDeliver,"" providing understanding of the value of information sharing towards the success of global health programs.  Methods:   Retrospective secondary data were extracted from NTDeliver, which included 1,484 shipments for four critical medicines ordered by over 100 countries between February 28, 2006 and December 31, 2018. We applied statistical regression models to analyze the impact on key performance metrics, comparing data before and after the system was implemented.  Findings:   The results suggest information sharing has a positive association with improvement for two key performance indicators: purchase order timeliness (β = 0.941, p = 0.003) and-most importantly-delivery timeliness (β = 0.828, p = 0.027). There is a positive association with improvement for three variables when the data are publicly shared: shipment timeliness (β = 2.57, p = 0.001), arrival timeliness (β = 2.88, p = 0.003), and delivery timeliness (β = 2.82, p = 0.011).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that information sharing between the NTD program partners via the NTDeliver system has a positive association with supply chain performance improvements, especially when data are shared publicly. Given the large volume of medicine and the significant number of people requiring these medicines, information sharing has the potential to provide improvements to global health programs affecting the health of tens to hundreds of millions of people.""","""['Elena Kasparis', 'Yufei Huang', 'William Lin', 'Christos Vasilakis']""","""[' Department for Health, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom.', ' Trinity Business School, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ' School of Management, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS Negl Trop Dis""","""[""Attendee's awareness about preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTD) control during the first world neglected tropical diseases day in Ekiti State, Nigeria."", 'Neglected tropical diseases: an effective global response to local poverty-related disease priorities.', 'Progress Report on Neglected Tropical Disease Drug Donation Programs.', 'Medicine donation programmes supporting the global drive to end the burden of neglected tropical diseases.', 'Review of the factors influencing the motivation of community drug distributors towards the control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).']"""

There is a dearth of validated methodologies for dealing with missing EQ-5D-5L data in the literature. This study, for the first time, examined the possibility of using retrospectively collected EQ-5D-5L data as proxies for the missing data.  Methods:   Participants who had prospectively completed a 3rd month postdischarge EQ-5D-5L instrument (in-the-moment collection) were randomly interviewed to respond to a 2nd ""retrospective collection"" of their 3rd month EQ-5D-5L at 6th, 9th, or 12th month after hospital discharge. A longitudinal single imputation was also used to assess the relative performance of retrospective collection compared with the longitudinal single imputation. Concordances between the in-the-moment, retrospective, and imputed measures were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and weighted kappa statistics.  Results:   Considerable agreement was observed on the basis of weighted kappa (range 0.72-0.95) between the mobility, self-care, and usual activities dimensions of EQ-5D-5L collected in-the-moment and retrospectively. Concordance based on intraclass correlation coefficients was good to excellent (range 0.79-0.81) for utility indices computed, and excellent (range 0.93-0.96) for quality-adjusted life-years computed using in-the-moment compared with retrospective EQ-5D-5L. The longitudinal single imputation did not perform as well as the retrospective collection method.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that retrospective collection of EQ-5D-5L has high concordance with ""in-the-moment"" EQ-5D-5L and could be a valid and attractive alternative for data imputation when longitudinally collected EQ-5D-5L data are missing.

Methods:   The clinical data of 100 suspected GERD patients were selected for retrospective analysis. The selection time was from June 2016 to June 2019. According to the gold standard (endoscopy) results, they were divided into the gastroesophageal reflux group (positive, n = 62) and the nongastroesophageal reflux group (negative, n = 38); both gastric filling ultrasound and GerdQ scale examination were performed to compare the positive predictive value and negative predictive value, evaluate the abdominal esophageal length, His angle, and GerdQ scale score, and analyze the AUC value, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index of His angle, length of abdominal esophagus, combined ultrasound parameters, and GerdQ scale in the diagnosis of GERD.  Results:   100 patients with suspected GERD were diagnosed as GERD by endoscopy; in a total of 62 cases, the percentage was 62.00%. Among them, 28 cases were caused by the abnormal structure and function of the antireflux barrier, accounting for 45.16%, 18 cases were caused by the reduction of acid clearance of the esophagus, accounting for 29.03%, and 16 cases were caused by the weakening of the esophageal mucosal barrier, accounting for 25.81%. After ultrasound detection, the positive predictive value was 88.71% and the negative predictive value was 81.58%; after the GerdQ scale was tested, the positive predictive value was 71.43% and the negative predictive value was 54.05%. The length of the abdominal esophagus in the gastroesophageal reflux group was lower than that of the nongastroesophageal reflux group, while the scores of His angle and GerdQ scale were higher than those in the gastroesophageal reflux group (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC values of His angle, length of abdominal esophagus, combined ultrasound parameters, and GerdQ scale to diagnose GERD were 0.957, 0.861, 0.996, and 0.931 (P < 0.05), their sensitivity was 93.5%, 98.40%, 98.40%, and 90.30%, and the specificity was 92.10%, 63.20%, 100.00%, and 92.10%, respectively.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, VRL patients who visited our hospital between October 2018 and July 2020 were reviewed. Aqueous samples were obtained before treatment and at clinical resolution after intravitreal MTX therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and the IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio were evaluated. Swept-source optical coherence tomographic images were obtained along with the aqueous samples. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), total vascular area of the choroid (TCA), stromal area (SA), luminal area (LA), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were assessed.  Results:   Twelve patients were enrolled (female:male-5:7). The mean age (± standard deviation) at diagnosis was 60.9±8.5 years. In the 16 eyes diagnosed with VRL, values of SFCT, TCA, LA, and SA significantly decreased after treatment (all p-values <0.05). Additionally, the aqueous cytokine IL-10 level and IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio were significantly decreased (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). The choroidal structure in the non-treated fellow eyes did not show any significant difference. There were no further changes in SFCT, TCA, LA, or CVI that occurred during maintenance therapy.

A systematic analysis of the overall brain metabolic pattern in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) could facilitate the understanding of the epileptic brain network and the associated brain damage effects of HH. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated 27 patients with epileptogenic HH (8 female patients; age, 2-33 years) by using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. The correlations among tomography result, seizure type, sex, and structural magnetic resonance imaging were assessed. Whole metabolic patterns and voxel-based morphometry findings were assessed by group analysis with healthy controls. Assessment of the whole metabolic pattern in patients with HH revealed several regional metabolic reductions in the cerebrum and an overall metabolic reduction in the cerebellum. In addition, areas showing hypometabolism in the neocortex were more widely distributed ipsilaterally than contralaterally to the HH. Reductions in glucose metabolism and gray matter volume in the neocortex were predominant ipsilateral to the HH. In conclusion, the glucose hypometabolism pattern in patients with epileptogenic HH involved the neocortex, subcortical regions, and cerebellum. The characteristics of glucose hypometabolism differed across seizure type and sex. Reductions in glucose metabolism and structural changes may be based on different mechanisms, but both are likely to occur ipsilateral to the HH in the neocortex.

Additionally, RSP patients' characteristics were analyzed according to forced vital capacity (FVC) tertile, and OSP patients' characteristics were analyzed according to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) tertile. Among the 112 patients with CPA (52 [46%] with RSP and 60 [54%] with OSP), body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with RSP than in those with OSP (17.6 kg/m2 versus 20.3 kg/m2; P = 0.003), and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease was more frequently observed in patients with RSP than in those with OSP (28.8% versus 11.7%; P = 0.004). Additionally, for patients with RSP, younger age and bilateral pulmonary lesions were more frequently observed in the first tertile group than in the other groups (P for trend: 0.025 and 0.001, respectively). For patients with OSP, low BMI, paracavitary infiltrates, and elevated WBC count were more frequently observed in the first tertile group than in the other groups (P for trend: < 0.001, 0.011, and 0.041, respectively). Differences in the clinical features of CPA patients were identified according to heterogeneous spirometric patterns and their severity.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study, 64 patients were included in this study who underwent abdominal MR scan that contained the mDixon sequence from June 2019 to May 2020(Included 7 patients with type 2 diabetes and 4 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), they were admitted to hospital through the obesity clinic set up by endocrine department, all of them were initially diagnosed and untreated). All of the 64 patients were scanned in 3.0T MR (Philips Ingenia II) due to their condition, 10-34 slice pancreas images were obtained, which were different from each other. Three different methods of measurement were employed by two observers using Philips Intellispace Portal software: (1) All images (whole-pancreas) measurement, the whole-pancreatic fat fraction (wPFF) was calculated by software. (2) Interval slices measurement, that is half-pancreatic slices fat fraction (hPFF) measured in the same way, fat fraction obtained by the interlayer assay was calculated. (3) As usual, the fat content of pancreatic head, body and tail fat was measured respectively, and in order to improve credibility, we also measured head、 body and tail in every layer, and its average value was taken. The elapsed time of the above different measurement methods was recorded. Intra-group correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to analyze the consistency of the measured data within and between observers. T-tests and Friedman tests were applied to compare the difference of measured values among groups.  Results:   No matter in normal person or diabetic or IGT, hPFF has shown good stability (ICChPFF = 0.988), and there was no significant difference compared with wPFF. But the average fat percentage composition of head, body and tail were significantly different from wPFF and hPFF (P < 0.01). At the same time, compared with normal person, pancreatic fat content in IGT and diabetic patients showed progressive significance(P<0.05).  Conclusion:   The distribution of pancreatic fat is not uniform, the method of measuring half pancreas by interlayer data collection can reflect the fat content of the entire pancreas, this suggests that measuring 50% of the pancreas is sufficient, this method effectively saves time and effort without affecting the results, which may have a better clinical application prospect.""","""['Xiaoyang Li', 'Qiushi Yang', 'Hang Ye', 'Shuo Li', 'Yuzhu Wang', 'Wanjiang Yu']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, The Third Affiliated Medical College of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, China.', ' Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', ' Weifang Medical College, Weifang, Shandong, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""PLoS One""","""['Pancreatic adipose tissue infiltration, parenchymal steatosis and beta cell function in humans.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging: Proton density fat fraction for assessment of pancreatic fatty infiltration during progression of T2DM bama minipigs.', 'Pancreatic fat is negatively associated with insulin secretion in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance: a nuclear magnetic resonance study.', 'Three-dimensional analysis of pancreatic fat by fat-water magnetic resonance imaging provides detailed characterization of pancreatic steatosis with improved reproducibility.', 'Nonalcoholic Fatty Pancreas Disease: Role in Metabolic Syndrome, ""Prediabetes,"" Diabetes and Atherosclerosis.']"""

In this study, we present free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, performed at the end of December 2020, for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased. The K417N mutation in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect. However, Lys417Asn seems to have a compensatory mechanism of action increasing the S1 RBD-ACE2 free energy of binding. This may explain the increased spread of the virus observed in the U.K. and South Africa and also gives rise to an important question regarding the possible human immune response and the success of the already available vaccines.

However, the exact impact of a slight delay in TPE initiation on the subsequent patients' outcome is still controversial.  Aim:   We aimed to study the frequency, short-term neurological consequences, and determinants of diagnostic delay in iTTP.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective monocentric study including patients with a first acute episode of iTTP (2005-2020) classified into 2 groups: delayed (>24h from first hospital visit, group 1) and immediate diagnosis (≤24h, group 2).  Results:   Among 42 evaluated patients, 38 were included. Eighteen cases (47%) had a delayed diagnosis (median: 5 days). The main misdiagnosis was immune thrombocytopenia (67%). The mortality rate was 5% (1 death in each group). Neurological events (stroke/TIA, seizure, altered mental status) occurred in 67% vs 30% patients in group 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.04). Two patients in group 1 exhibited neurological sequelae. The hospital length of stay was longer in group 1 (p = 0.02). At the first hospital evaluation, potential alternative causes of thrombocytopenia were more prevalent in group 1 (33% vs 5%, p = 0.04). Anemia was less frequent in group 1 (67% vs 95%, p = 0.04). All patients had undetectable haptoglobin levels. By contrast, 26% of schistocytes counts were <1%, mostly in group 1 (62% vs 11%, p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Diagnostic delay is highly prevalent in iTTP, with a significant impact on short-term neurological outcome.

To identifying outcomes and risk factors associated with adverse postnatal outcomes.  Methods:   This is a sixty-two patient case series at an academic referral center. Patients with prenatally diagnosed oropharyngeal masses were identified through a programmatic database and confirmed in the electronic health record.  Results:   Sixty-two patient with prenatally diagnosed oropharyngeal mass were identified, with prenatal imaging at our institution confirming this diagnosis in fifty-seven patients, short term outcomes analysis conducted on forty-four patients, and long-term outcomes analysis conducted on seventeen patients. The most common pathology was lymphatic malformations (n = 27, 47.4%), followed by teratomas (n = 22, 38.6%). The median mass volume from all available patient imaging (n = 57) was 60.54 cm3 (range 1.73-742.5 cm3). Thirteen pregnancies were interrupted, six infants expired, and thirteen cases had an unknown fetal outcome. Confirmed mortality was 6/57 patients with imaging-confirmed oropharyngeal masses (10.5%). Fourteen (56%) of the surviving patients (n = 25) were delivered by Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT) procedure and the median NICU stay was thirty-six days (range: 3-215 days). There was no association between airway compression/deviation/displacement, stomach size, polyhydramnios, or mass size and mortality. Seventeen patients had more than one year of follow-up (mean 5.3 ± 2.4 years). These seventeen patients underwent general anesthesia a total of ninety-two times (mean 5.4 ± 4.3) and had a total of twenty-three mass-related surgeries. The great majority of patients required an artificial airway at birth, feeding support, and speech/swallow therapy.  Conclusions:   Oropharyngeal mass involvement of key anatomic structures-the neck, upper thorax, orbit, and ear, has a greater association with mortality than mass size.

Endoscopic methods may lead to a decreasing indication of PTD in the future, but today it is still the standard treatment method, especially in hilar obstructions.  Methods:   In our retrospective data analysis, we assessed technical success rate, reintervention rate, morbidity, mortality, and the learning curve of patients treated with PTD over 12 years in a tertiary referral center.  Results:   599 patients were treated with 615 percutaneous interventions. 94.5% (566/599) technical success rate; 2.7% (16/599) reintervention rate were achieved. 111 minor and 22 major complications occurred including 1 case of death. In perihilar obstruction, cholangitis were significantly more frequent in cases where endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography had also been performed prior to PTD compared to PTD alone, with 39 (18.2%) and 15 (10.5%) occurrences, respectively.  Discussion:   The results and especially the excellent success rates demonstrate that PTD is safe and effective, and it is appropriate for first choice in the treatment algorithm of perihilar stenosis.

Potassium is a regulator of pro-oxidants and antioxidants. Albumin and vitamin B12 (B12) are vital antioxidant agents in the circulatory system. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidative role of serum potassium, albumin and B12 in FP.  Methods:   Serum levels of potassium, albumin and B12 were retrospectively analyzed in 21 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of FP, 105 bacterial peritonitis (BP) patients and 210 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis without peritonitis.  Results:   Serum levels of potassium, albumin and B12 were lower in FP patients than in BP patients. Serum potassium concentration was statistically related to albumin concentration in peritonitis patients. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis suggested that serum level of potassium and albumin were independent risk factors of FP when compared with BP. Lower potassium and B12 levels were independently associated with higher rates of technique failure in peritonitis.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest lower serum potassium, albumin and B12 as potential oxidative stress markers of FP and raise the hypothesis that an increased level of OS could contribute to FP.KEY MESSAGESFP remains a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), with higher morbidity (1-23.8%) and mortality (2-25%), and oxidative stress plays a role in it.Our study suggested serum potassium, albumin and vitamin B12 as potential oxidative stress markers of fungal peritonitis.""","""['Lingling Liu', 'Kehang Xie', 'Mengmeng Yin', 'Xiaoqiu Chen', 'Binhuan Chen', 'Jianting Ke', 'Cheng Wang']""","""[' Department of Nephrology, Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China.', ' Department of Neurology, Zhuhai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhuhai, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Ann Med""","""['Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: a 10 year retrospective analysis in a single center.', 'Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: 5-year review from a North China center.', 'Fungal peritonitis in children on peritoneal dialysis at a tertiary care Centre.', 'Fungal peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis.', 'Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.', 'Systematic Oxidative Stress Indexes Associated with the Prognosis in Patients with T Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukemia.']"""

The performance of predictive models should be reevaluated periodically. The aim of this study was to reassess the discrimination of the six commonly used models for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis based on the Sepsis 3.0 criteria.  Methods:   Patient data were extracted from the fourth edition of the Medical Information Mart for Critical Care (MIMIC IV) database. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and III (SAPS III) scores were calculated and collected. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to compare the discrimination abilities of the models using non-parametric Wilcoxon statistics. The Delong method was used to perform pairwise comparisons of the AUROCs of the models. Multiple subgroup analyses for age, body mass index, and sex were performed with regard to the 28-day mortality prediction of the models.  Results:   A total of 12 691 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 65.97 ± 15.77 years; 7673 patients (60.50%) were male. The mean SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, SAPS II, LODS, and SAPS III scores were higher in the non-survivor group than in the survivor group. The discrimination for 28-day mortality with the SAPS III (AUROC 0.812, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.802-0.822) and LODS (AUROC 0.804, 95% CI 0.743-0.765) models was superior to that of the SIRS (AUROC 0.575, 95% CI 0.562-0.589), SOFA (AUROC 0.612, 95% CI 0.598-0.626), OASIS (AUROC 0.753, 95% CI 0.742-0.764), and SAPS II (AUROC 0.754, 95% CI 0.743-0.765) models. The Youden index of the SAPS III model was 0.484, which was the highest among the models. Subgroup analyses showed similar results to the overall results.  Conclusions:   The discrimination for 28-day mortality with the SAPS III and LODS models was superior to that of the SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, and SAPS II models.

The primary concern for opponents of MMS in melanoma remains the difficulty associated with interpretation of frozen sections compared with traditional paraffin sections; this has been made easier with the advent of immunostaining.  Objective:   Our study aims to assess the concordance in clearance reporting of LM in immunostained frozen sections compared with permanent paraffin sections and hematoxylin and eosin staining.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 38 LM cases treated by MMS between 2017 and 2020 in Melbourne, Australia. Immunostained frozen sections were assessed by a Mohs surgeon, whereas permanent paraffin sections were assessed by an external dermatopathologist.  Results:   We report 86% agreement in reporting of LM in immunostained frozen sections compared with permanent paraffin sections. In 5/38 cases, permanent paraffin sections were reported as clear for LM, but the Mohs surgeon had detected positive margins, requiring further excision.

This study retrospectively included individuals ≥ 50 years of age, underwent overnight polysomnographic (PSG) for the evaluation of OSA, and performed MRI and transcranial Doppler (TCD) within 12 months of interval without a neurological event between the evaluations. TCD parameters for the cerebrovascular compliance included middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA PI) and mean MCA resistance index ratio (MRIR). SVD parameters included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, number of lacunes, enlarged perivascular space (ePVS) score, and the presence of microbleeds or lacunes. Ninety-seven individuals (60.8% male, mean age 70.0±10.5 years) were included. MRIR was associated with higher respiratory distress index (B = 0.003; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.005; P = 0.021), while MCA PI was not associated with any of the PSG markers for OSA severity.

However, it carries risks such as bleeding and perforation. The aim of this study was to identify the indications for endoscopic intervention in patients with CD and small bowel stenosis.  Methods:   From November 2007 to March 2020, 143 CD patients with small bowel stenosis were enrolled in this study. We identified the factors associated with not requiring endoscopic intervention during long-term follow-up of these patients.  Results:   Forty of the 143 patients had abdominal symptoms of stenosis and had undergone EBD, whereas the remaining 103 were asymptomatic and had not undergone endoscopic intervention. During long-term follow-up, 95 of those 103 patients never required endoscopic or surgical intervention. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that not consuming an elemental diet (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.48-6.82; p < .01) and ileocecal valve (ICV) stenosis (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.83; p = .02) were independently associated with not requiring EBD.

However, further research in this area is needed due to the limitations of circulating extracellular vesicles detection methods. Using the Single Molecule array (SiMoa) technology, we developed two extracellular vesicle detection assays, CD9-CD63 and PD-L1-CD63, to determine circulating universal EVs and PD-L1 positive EVs, respectively. A total of 164 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients were retrospectively included in this study. Compared with healthy volunteers (n = 25), elevated CD9-CD63 and PD-L1-CD63 signals were detected in the plasma of DLBCL patients (n = 164). High CD9-CD63 signals was associated with molecular subtype, extranodal site and treatment response in DLBCL. A high PD-L1-CD63 signal was also associated with certain clinical features, including extranodal site and treatment response. CD9-CD63 and PD-L1-CD63 signals were found to be important prognostic factors for both progression-free and overall survival. Furthermore, PD-L1-positive EVs were found in all patients, though PD-L1 protein expression was positive in only 35.4% (17/48) of tumor biopsies. No correlation was found between circulating PD-L1+ EVs and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) levels.

Side effects are related to overstimulation of the immune system. Thyroid dysfunction (TD) is the most common endocrine immune-related adverse event of ICPI.  Objective:   To describe the clinical presentation and the course of TD in cancer patients treated with ICPI referred to an endocrinology outpatient clinic.  Material and methods:   This was a descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study of patients with TD associated with ICPI in six Spanish hospitals.  Results:   120 patients (50.8% women), mean age 60 ± 12 years were included. The initial TD was hypothyroidism in 49% of patients and hyperthyroidism in 51%, with an average of 76 (41-140) and 43 (26-82) days respectively between the onset of ICPI and the analytical alteration. Significantly, the earlier the first analytical determination was, the greater the prevalence of hyperthyroidism. A turnover was observed in 80% of subjects during follow-up, mostly from hyperthyroidism to hypothyroidism. Twenty-one percent received double ICPI therapy. The most frequent form of presentation in monotherapy was hypothyroidism (57%), and in double therapy it was hyperthyroidism (77%) (p = 0.002). Patients under double therapy showed thyroid alterations earlier than those in the monotherapy group (p = 0.001). After a follow-up of 205 (112-360) days, half of the patients continued under levothyroxine treatment.  Conclusions:   Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism present in a similar proportion in cancer patients undergoing ICPI therapy. Our results suggest that transitory hyperthyroidism may not be detected in a relevant number of cases. In addition, TD in double therapy presents earlier.

Methods:   We designed a retrospective, multicentre and nation-wide analysis of patients with total thyroidectomy who were seen in twenty endocrinology departments from January to March 2018. We selected patients with histologically proven thyroid cancer and retrieved information related to surgical procedure and thyroid cancer features. Survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to study the relationship between these variables and the recovery of parathyroid function.  Results:   From 685 patients with hypoparathyroidism at discharge of surgery, 495 (72.3%) recovered parathyroid function over time. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that this recovery was significantly related to the presence of specialized surgical team (P<0.001), identification of parathyroid glands at surgery (P<0.001), papillary histopathology (P=0.040), and higher levels of postoperative calcium (Ca) (P<0.001) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (P<0.001).

Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the significant and independent factors for recovery of parathyroid function were postoperative concentrations of Ca (P=0.038) and PTH (P=0.049). The presence of lymph node metastases was a negative predictor of recuperation of parathyroid function (P=0.042) in this analysis.

Sarcopenia has been recognized as an adverse factor for surgical outcomes in several malignancies. However, the impact of preoperative sarcopenia on rectal cancer patients receiving CRT is still unknown.  Methods:   This retrospective study included cT3-T4 anyN M0 lower rectal cancer patients who underwent CRT followed by R0 resection at our institution between October 2003 and December 2016. CRT consisted of 5-fluorouracil-based oral chemotherapy and long course radiation (50.4 Gy/28 fr). The psoas muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra level was evaluated by computed tomography before and after CRT, and was adjusted by the square of the height to obtain the psoas muscle mass index (PMI). Sarcopenia was defined as the sex-specific lowest quartile of the PMI. We assessed the association between pre- and post-CRT sarcopenia and postoperative prognosis.  Results:   Among 234 patients, 55 and 179 patients were categorized as sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia patients, respectively. Although post-CRT sarcopenia correlated with residual tumor size, it had no association with other pathological features. The median follow-up period was 72.9 months, and the 5-year DFS and OS were 67.0% and 85.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that post-CRT sarcopenia was independently associated with poor DFS (HR: 1.76; P = 0.036), OS (HR: 2.01; P = 0.049), and recurrence in the liver (HR: 3.01; P = 0.025).

The scope of this new study was to investigate the brain subcortical gray structures, by means of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, in RLS patients in order to assess the presence of any volume or shape abnormalities involving these structures.  Methods:   Thirty-three normal controls (24 females and nine males) and 45 RLS patients (34 females and 11 males) were retrospectively recruited and underwent a 1.5 Tesla MRI study with two-dimensional T1 sequences in the sagittal plane. Post-processing was performed by means of the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Analysis Group Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) software, and both volumetric and morphological analyses of the thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, brainstem, hippocampus, and amygdala, bilaterally, were carried out.  Results:   A statistically significant volumetric reduction in the left amygdala and left globus pallidus was found in subjects with RLS, as well as large surface morphological alterations affecting the amygdala bilaterally and other less widespread surface changes in both hippocampi, the right caudate, the left globus pallidus, and the left putamen.  Conclusions:   These findings seem to indicate that the basic mechanisms of RLS might include a pathway involving not only the hypothalamus-spinal dopaminergic circuit (nucleus A11), but also pathways including the basal ganglia and structures that are part of the limbic system; moreover, structural alterations in RLS seem to concern the morphology as well as the volume of the above structures.

We aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical staining features of D2-40 (podoplanin), SMA (smooth muscle actin) and CD68 (pan-macrophage marker) in patients with early stage invasive breast cancer with/out peritumoral PASH-like stroma.  Methods:   The H&E sections of core needle biopsy specimens of invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed during one-year time period were reviewed in terms of the presence of accompanying PASH-like stroma retrospectively. Cases with similar pattern of growth in their surgical excision materials were included. Eight cases were grouped as 'Invasive tumor with PASH-like stroma' and 21 cases as 'Invasive tumor without PASH-like stroma', consecutively. The results of immunohistochemical staining for D2-40, SMA and CD68 were noted semiquantitatively as 'negative','weak', moderate' or 'strong'.  Results:   CD68 was found significantly lower in invasive tumor with peritumoral PASH-like stroma than those of tumor without PASH-like stroma.

Yet, their excellent remodeling ability provides good clinical-radiographic outcomes even in case of non-anatomical reduction. The reduction under analgesia or sedation involves hospitalizations, greater risks, and higher hospital costs. The aim of this preliminary study is to demonstrate the accountability and conveniency of non-anatomical reduction.  Methods:   The study involved all 0-8 years-old children who were affected by a closed overriding DRF from February 2017 to December 2018 and were managed non-operatively by a long arm cast without reduction, analgesia, or sedation treatments. We retrospectively evaluated their clinical-radiographic outcomes and healing time. The costs of no-reduction treatments were compared with those of the two main approaches to DRFs, that is: closed reduction under sedation and application of a long arm cast; closed reduction under anesthesia, percutaneous pinning, and application of a long arm cast. The comparison was based on the Diagnosis Related Group system.  Results:   We treated 11 children with an average initial radial shortening of 5±3 mm and average initial sagittal and coronal angulations of 4.0° and 3.5°, respectively. Average casting duration was 40 days. All patients achieved a full range of wrist motion without deformities. The procedure was respectively 7 times less expensive than closed reduction in emergency room under sedation and application of a long arm cast, and 64 times less expensive than closed reduction in the operating room under anesthesia, percutaneous pinning, and application of a long arm cast.  Conclusions:   In children aged 0-8 years, non-operative treatment of closed overriding DRFs with a long arm cast without reduction is a simple and cost-effective procedure with both clinical and radiographic medium-term excellent outcomes.""","""['Mario Marinelli', 'Daniele Massetti', 'Giulia Facco', 'Danya Falcioni', 'Valentino Coppa', 'Valentina Maestri', 'Antonio Gigante']""","""[' Clinic of Adult and Paediatric Orthopaedics, Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, Italy.

So far, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of VL associated HLH have not been well elucidated.  Method and findings:   In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory profiles between 17 patients with VL associated HLH and 27 patients with VL alone admitted at the Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University from May 2016 to March 2021. In addition to the identification of Leishmania infection, hemophagocytosis was identified in bone marrow in the most cases of VL associated HLH (15/17). The patients with VL associated HLH had higher chances of bleeding, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated secretion of soluble IL-2 receptor or lower NK cell activity compared to patients with VL only. Furthermore, patients with VL associated HLH had higher inflammation status associated with higher levels of Th1 (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70), Th2 (IL-4) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-23) in the peripheral blood, and higher parasite load (qPCR and parasite culture). All 27 VL cases were totally recovered after being treated with Sodium Stibogluconate, five of the 17 patients with VL associated HLH died even after timely treatment with anti-parasite and immunosuppressive chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   Without appropriate treatment, visceral leishmaniosis could develop to secondary HLH.

Influenza virus infections are associated with a high hospitalization rate in children between the ages of 5 and 14. The predominant reason for poor influenza prognosis is the lack of any effective means for early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of severe illness is critical to improving patient outcome, and could be especially useful in areas with limited medical resources. Accurate, inexpensive, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools could improve early diagnosis and patient outcome, and reduce overall healthcare costs. We developed an interleukin-6 paper-based test strip that used colloidal gold-conjugated antibodies to detect human interleukin-6 protein. These complexes were captured on a paper-based test strip patterned with perpendicular T lines that were pre-coated with anti-human interleukin-6 antibodies. Applied serum samples interacted with these antibodies and presented as colored bands that could be read using a spectrum-based optical reader. The full-spectrum of the reflected light interleukin-6 protein signal could be obtained from the spectral optics module, and the standard could be used to quantitatively analyze interleukin 6 level in serum. We retrospectively evaluated 10 children (23 serum samples) with severe influenza virus infections, 26 children (26 serum samples) with mild influenza virus infections, and 10 healthy children (10 serum samples). Our system, the combined use of a paper-based test strip and a spectrum-based optical reader, provided both qualitative and quantitative information. When used with the optical reader, the detection limit was improved from a qualitative, naked-eye level of 400 pg/ml to a quantitative, optical reader level of 76.85 pg/ml. After monitoring serum interleukin-6 level via our system, we found a high correlation between our system results and those obtainable using a conventional sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (Rho = 0.706, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between severe and mild influenza using our combined method (test strip coupled with optical reader) were 78.3 and 50.0%, respectively. When interleukin-6 was combined with serum C-reaction protein, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.7 and 95.5%, and the receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve was quite high (AUC = 0.911, p < 0.001). The potential advantages of our system, i.e., a paper-based test strip coupled with a spectrum-based optical reader, are as follows: 1) simple user operation; 2) rapid turnaround times-within 20 min; 3) high detection performance; and, 4) low-cost fabrication.""","""['Sheng-Wen Lin', 'Ching-Fen Shen', 'Ching-Chuan Liu', 'Chao-Min Cheng']""","""[' Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', ' Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', ' Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', ' Center of Infectious Disease and Signaling Research, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""Front Bioeng Biotechnol""","""['Corrigendum: A Paper-Based IL-6 Test Strip Coupled With a Spectrum-Based Optical Reader for Differentiating Influenza Severity in Children.', 'Corrigendum: A Paper-Based IL-6 Test Strip Coupled With a Spectrum-Based Optical Reader for Differentiating Influenza Severity in Children.', 'Paper-Based Interleukin-6 Test Strip for Early Detection of Wound Infection.', 'Development and evaluation of a paramagnetic nanoparticle based immunochromatographic strip for specific detection of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.', 'Interleukin-6 Test Strip Combined With a Spectrum-Based Optical Reader for Early Recognition of COVID-19 Patients With Risk of Respiratory Failure.', '3M Rapid Detection Flu A + B Test: a new diagnostic test for rapid detection of influenza A and influenza B.', 'Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies in Vaccinated Pregnant Women and Neonates by Using a Lateral Flow Immunoassay Coupled with a Spectrum-Based Reader.']"""

Applied research usually describes a delay in primary task resumption as an essential component of this performance deficit. Here, we investigate this approach using electrophysiological correlates of the focusing of attention within working memory, a process that is fundamental to switching between different tasks. A lateralized working memory task was frequently interrupted by either a high- or low-demanding arithmetic task and a subsequent retrospective cue indicated the working memory item required for later report. The detrimental effect of interruptions on primary task performance was most pronounced for high-demanding interruptions. After retro-cue presentation, fronto-central theta power (4-7 Hz) was lowest following high-demanding interruptions and posterior alpha power (8-14 Hz) was less suppressed in the two interruption conditions. These effects might be related to a deficit in attentional control processes following the retrospective cue. Furthermore, we introduce the suppression of posterior alpha power contralateral to the remembered primary task stimuli during the interruption phase as a temporal marker for primary task resumption. Especially for cognitively demanding interruption tasks, this effect seems to overlap in time with the processing of the interruption, which should contribute to the primary task performance deficit.""","""['Bianca Zickerick', 'Marlene Rösner', 'Melinda Sabo', 'Daniel Schneider']""","""[' Ergonomics Department, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Eur J Neurosci""","""['Aging impairs primary task resumption and attentional control processes following interruptions.', 'Perturbing Neural Representations of Working Memory with Task-irrelevant Interruption.', 'The Effect of Task Interruption on Working Memory Performance.', 'Effects of Nested Interruptions on Task Resumption: A Laboratory Study With Intensive Care Nurses.', 'Age-related differences in reallocating cognitive resources when dealing with interruptions.', 'Exploring how healthcare teams balance the neurodynamics of autonomous and collaborative behaviors: a proof of concept.', 'Fatigue-Related Effects in the Process of Task Interruption on Working Memory.']"""

ERT was delivered with median 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions to the pelvis and VB with median 30 Gy in 6 fractions.  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 46 months. Five out of 30 patients treated with ERT alone experienced vaginal recurrence within 2 years after surgery. The 5-year local control (LC) was 100% in patients receiving ERT + VB compared with 81.3% in patients receiving ERT alone (log rank p = 0.022). The 5-year pelvic control (PC) was 95.8% for patients receiving ERT + VB and 76.8% for ERT alone (p = 0.041). The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were not significantly different between treatment groups. In multivariate analysis, perineural invasion was a significant risk factor for PC (p = 0.024). Parametrial involvement (p = 0.044) and vascular invasion (p = 0.032) were unfavorable prognostic factors for RFS. Late toxicity occurrences were not significant in both groups.  Conclusion:   VB after ERT improved LC and PC in cervical cancer patients with close or positive RM after hysterectomy. The toxicities were not increased after VB was added to ERT.""","""['Yun Hee Lee', 'Yeon Sil Kim', 'Kyu Hye Choi', 'SooYoon Sung', 'Bae Kwon Jeong', 'In Bong Ha', 'Ki Mun Kang', 'Jayoung Lee', 'Jong Hoon Lee', 'Sung Hwan Kim']""","""["" Department of Radiation Oncology, Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 327, Sosa-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, 14647, Republic of Korea."", "" Department of Radiation Oncology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222, Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", "" Department of Radiation Oncology, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 1021, Tongil-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, 03312, Republic of Korea."", ' Department of Radiation Oncology, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine and Gyeongsang National University Hospital, 79, Gangnam-ro, Jinju, 52727, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine and Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, 11 Samjungja-ro, Changwon, 51472, Republic of Korea.', ' AITRICS, 28, Hyoryeong-ro 77-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', "" Department of Radiation Oncology, St. Vincent's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 93, Jungbu-daero, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, 16247, Republic of Korea."", "" Department of Radiation Oncology, St. Vincent's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 93, Jungbu-daero, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, 16247, Republic of Korea. kimandre@catholic.ac.kr.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Operable stage IB and II cancer of the uterine neck: retrospective comparison between preoperative utero-vaginal curietherapy and initial surgery followed by radiotherapy.', 'Long-term outcomes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and high dose rate brachytherapy as adjuvant therapy after radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.', 'Operable Stages IB and II cervical carcinomas: a retrospective study comparing preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy and postoperative radiotherapy.', 'An audit of the treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix using external beam radiotherapy and a single line source brachytherapy technique.', 'Treatment results of high-dose-rate remote afterloading brachytherapy for cervical cancer and retrospective comparison of two regimens.']"""

The shift in direct clinical learning opportunities provided to third- and fourth-year medical students required a shift in the educational curriculum to develop learner skills around the appropriate use of telehealth in patient care.  Objectives:   The aim of this project was to provide exposure to students so they could learn the telemedicine equipment and best practices, and how to identify infectious diseases to improve access to care and meet the needs of the patient.  Methods:   In July and August of 2020, the Indiana Area Health Education Centers Program partnered with Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MUCOM) to support a 1 day telehealth simulation (online curriculum, group lecture, and two standardized patient encounters) into their clerkship curriculum. We utilized a retrospective pretest-posttest to assess changes in learner knowledge around telehealth after the program. At the conclusion of the telehealth training program, students were asked to complete a retrospective pretest-posttest assessing their level of preparedness to utilize telehealth equipment, their preparedness to demonstrate ""telehealth best practices"" in a manner consistent with protecting patient (and data) privacy, their confidence to utilize telehealth for identification of infectious diseases, and their confidence to utilize telehealth to identify proper treatment plans.  Results:   A total of 96 learners completed the program in 2020. Posttest results demonstrate a statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement for learners' self-reported level of preparedness to utilize telehealth equipment, their preparedness to demonstrate ""telehealth best practices"" in a manner consistent with protecting patient (and data) privacy, their confidence to utilize telehealth for identification of infectious diseases, and their confidence to utilize telehealth to identify proper treatment plans.

Recently, erector spinae muscle (ESM) mass has been proposed as a parameter to assess frailty accurately. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether preoperative ESM mass is associated with short- and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with LVAD.  Methods:   A total of 119 consecutive patients with LVAD were enrolled between January 2010 and October 2017 at a single heart center. The ESM area, ESM index, and Hounsfield units (HU) of the ESM were calculated by computed tomography for preoperative ESM mass evaluation. We then statistically evaluated the in-hospital mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), duration of hospital stay, and long-term survival.  Results:   In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, ESM mass indicated no effect on all clinical outcomes. In addition, the ESM area presented a weak but significant negative linear correlation only with the duration of hospital stay (r = -0.21, p < .05). In contrast, the Model For End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and preoperative venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) were significant predictive factors for in-hospital mortality (MELD score: p < .001, hazard ratio [HR] 1.1; preoperative va-ECMO: p < .01, HR 2.72) and MACE (MELD score: p < .001, HR 1.07; preoperative va-ECMO: p < .005, HR 2.62).

Methods:   We retrospectively studied 34 pregnant patients with congenital LVOT obstruction or AS with healthy age-matched pregnant controls. Patients with other significant valvular lesions, structural heart disease (LVEF < 40%), or prior valve surgery were excluded. All LVOTO/AS patients underwent a minimum of two consecutive echocardiograms between 1 year pre-conception and 1 year postpartum, with at least two studies during the pregnancy. Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation was performed including speckle-tracking LV global longitudinal strain.  Results:   A total of 83 echocardiograms from the study group and 34 echocardiograms from the control group were evaluated. Over the range of LVOTO/AS, a significantly greater increase in the AV gradients and LV and LA volumes were observed as compared with the controls. In the sub-group of LVOTO/AS pregnant women with ≥ moderate (n = 8) versus < moderate LVOTO/AS (n = 26), averaged 2nd /3rd trimester LVEF was lower (51 ± 12)% versus (58 ± 4)%, (p = 0.02) and GLS was lower (-19.5 ± 2.8) versus (21.2 ± 2.4), (p = 0.06). Pregnancy was well tolerated despite these changes.  Conclusion:   Among pregnant women with even milder forms of LVOTO/AS, increases in cardiac volumes and AV gradients can be expected over the course of pregnancy.

Therefore, the traditionally recommended size of a composite graft for nasal reconstruction is less than 1.5 cm in diameter. However, the distal nose is generally well supplied with blood vessels, which might support the use of larger composite grafts in such a highly vascularized recipient site. The aim of the article is to investigate whether a large skin-fat-fascia composite graft (larger than 2.0 cm) is viable for the repair of partial-thickness nasal defects.  Methods:   From October 2017 to December 2019, 13 patients with partial-thickness nasal defects underwent nasal reconstruction using a large postauricular skin-fat-fascia composite graft. Cases were followed up for 3 to 14 months postoperatively. The aesthetic outcome was evaluated in comparison with preoperative digital images.  Results:   Skin-fat-fascia composite grafts survived without graft necrosis, dermal fibrosis, or skin contraction in all cases. Favorable aesthetic outcomes were obtained in all patients, and no further revision surgery was need.  Conclusions:   A postauricular composite graft larger than 2.0 cm is a safe and effective reconstruction approach for partial-thickness nasal defects. This technique offers significant advantages in terms of no additional facial scar, no visible asymmetry on the face, no additional surgery for revision, and with mild scar in the donor site of the postauricular region.""","""['Aijuan He', 'Jinchao Yu', 'Ninghua Liu', 'Xinhai Ye']""","""[' From the Department of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Eye & ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Ann Plast Surg""","""['A 10-year experience in nasal reconstruction with the three-stage forehead flap.', 'Reconstruction of nasal alar defects in asian patients.', 'Healing of composite chondrocutaneous auricular grafts covered by skin flaps in nasal reconstructive surgery.', 'Double forehead flap reconstruction of composite nasal defects.', 'Leave the fat, skip the bolster: thinking outside the box in lower third nasal reconstruction.']"""

Methods:   Using retrospective computed tomographic perfusion data from 57 patients, split as training/validation (60%/40%), we developed and validated separate 2-dimensional U-net models for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and time to maximum (Tmax) maps calculation to predict core infarct and tissue at risk, respectively. Once trained, the full sets of 28 input images were sequentially reduced to equitemporal 14, 10, and 7 time points. The averaged structural similarity index measure between the model-derived images and ground truth perfusion maps was compared. Volumes for core infarct and Tmax were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient.  Results:   Both CBF and Tmax maps derived using 28 and 14 time points had similar structural similarity index measure (0.80-0.81; P>0.05) when compared with ground truth images. The Pearson correlation for the CBF and Tmax volumes derived from the model using 28-tp with ground truth volumes derived from the RAPID software was 0.69 for CBF and 0.74 for Tmax. The predicted maps were fully concordant in terms of laterality to the commercial perfusion maps. The mean Dice scores were 0.54 for the core infarct and 0.63 for the hypoperfusion maps.  Conclusions:   Artificial intelligence model-derived volumes show good correlation with RAPID-derived volumes for CBF and Tmax. Within the constraints of a small sample size, the perfusion map quality is similar when using 14-tp instead of 28-tp. Our findings provide proof of concept that vendor neutral artificial intelligence models for computed tomographic perfusion processing using complete or partial image data sets appear feasible.

Methods:   This retrospective case series included: 1) adults (≥ 18 years old), 2) resuscitated from OHCA, 3) ≥ 1 OH and 1 ED ECG/patient, and 4) emergency medical services (EMS) transport to the study hospital. OH and ED ECGs were classified as: 1) STEMI (ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction), 2) Ischemic, and 3) Non-ischemic. Two ED physicians and one cardiologist independently classified all ECGs, then generated a consensus opinion classification for each ECG based on American Heart Association's 2018 Expert Consensus criteria. The most ischemic OH ECG classification was compared with the last ED ECG classification.  Results:   From 7/27/12 to 7/18/19, 176 patients were entered with a mean age of 61.2 ± 16.6 years; 102/176 (58%) were male. Overall, 504 OH and ED 12-lead ECGs were acquired (2.9 ECGs/patient). ECG classification inter-rater reliability kappa score was 0.63 ± 0.02 (substantial agreement). Overall, 86/176 (49%) changed ECG classification from the OH to ED setting; 69/86 (80%) of these ECGs changed from more to less ischemic classifications.

A less invasive technique is a totally percutaneous bypass using vascular closure devices (VCDs) with concerns for lower limb ischemia and arterial stenosis. Since April 2018, we have adopted the standard use of total percutaneous CPB in our robotic mitral cases. We report our institutional results with this technique.  Methods:   All consecutive patients who underwent robotic mitral valve surgery between April 2018 and December 2020 in our institution were included in our study. Hospital database data on demographics, operative variables, and surgical outcomes were recorded and analyzed.  Results:   Robotic mitral valve surgeries were performed on 32 consecutive patients (mean age 57.2 ± 14.8) between April 2018 and December 2020. None of our patients developed an infection at any site. Seroma, hematoma, or pseudoaneurysm were not observed at puncture sites. Surgical repair of the femoral vessels or an additional VCD was not necessary for any of our patients. Patients were followed up for a mean duration of 23.5 months. Our patients did not present with a late wound infection, a seroma, or a pseudoaneurysm, nor had complaints of limb ischemia or claudication.  Conclusion:   Total percutaneous bypass is the least invasive method of establishing extracorporeal circulation for cardiac surgery and can be performed with excellent results. The benefits of robotic surgery can be expanded with better results in groin cannulation by the adoption of total percutaneous CPB.""","""['Murat Bastopcu', 'Sahin Senay', 'Ahmet Ü Güllü', 'Muharrem Kocyigit', 'Cem Alhan']""","""[' Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tatvan State Hospital, Bitlis, Turkey.', ' Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University, Istanbul, Turkey.', ' Department of Anesthesiology, Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University, Istanbul, Turkey.']""","""2022""","""2022 Feb""","""J Card Surg""","""['Percutaneous Vascular Closure Device in Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery.', 'Percutaneous cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass in minimally invasive surgery is associated with reduced groin complications.', 'Use of Percutaneous Cannulation in Robotic Mitral Valve Surgery.', 'A Phase 1 Study of a Novel Bidirectional Perfusion Cannula in Patients Undergoing Femoral Cannulation for Cardiac Surgery.', 'Robotic mitral valve repair.', ""Robotic mitral valve replacement; results from the world's largest series.""]"""

Their main role is to maintain the stability of the genome during cell replication through a mechanism of copying the repeted sequence by the telomerase complexe. All the diseases involving a deregulation of this complex are now grouped together under the term telomeropathies. They are difficult to diagnose and manage. Our objective was to describe the clinico-biological characteristics and treatments used, in patients affected by telomeropathies previously seen by an hematologist followed at the Lille University Hospital Center.  Methods:   This is a retrospective, single-center study carried out within the department of internal medicine-clinical immunology, Reference center for rare autoimmune and systemic diseases at Lille University Hospital Center between 2005 and 2020 including all patients followed for telomeropathy.  Results:   Probands and relatives were included. Fifteen patients were studied from 10 independant families. Sixty percent had an heterozygous TERC gene mutation. Sixty seven percent had haematological diseases including macrocytosis, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, 20 % had a fibrotic hepatic disease, 27 % had a fibrotic pulmonary disease. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping showed a double negative T lymphocyte population with γδ TCR expression in 5 (33 %) patients. Forty-seven percent of the patients had not received any treatment. Twenty-seven percent were on androgen therapy. Twenty percent had received cyclosporine and 13 % anti-lymphocyte serum in the context of initial misdiagnosis.  Conclusion:   It is important to be aware of the complexity of telomeropathies, a differential diagnosis of immune aplastic anemia, in order to optimize management and avoid inappropriate treatments.

We aimed to clarify stereotactic body radiotherapy outcomes for long bone metastases.  Methods:   Data of patients receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy for long bone metastases (July 2016-November 2020) were retrospectively reviewed. The prescribed dose was 30 or 35 Gy in five fractions. The endpoints were local failure and adverse effects. Local failure was defined as radiological tumor growth within the irradiation field. Adverse effects were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.  Results:   Nineteen osseous lesions in 17 patients were assessed. The target lesions included 13 femoral, 4 humeral and 2 radial lesions. The median follow-up duration was 14 (range, 3-62) months. The 12- and 18-month local failure rates were 0 and 11%, respectively. Following 2 and 46 months of stereotactic body radiotherapy, two lesions (11%) resulted in painful femoral fractures (grade 3). Both patients underwent bipolar hip arthroplasty and could walk normally after surgery. In the late phase, one patient developed radiculopathy (almost complete paralysis of grasp) and another developed grade 2 limb edema. Other grade 2 or more severe acute and late toxicities were not observed during the follow-up period.  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy for long bone metastases achieved excellent local control and caused two femoral fractures.

As a retrospective study, we follow up with our five LOPD patients treated with Myozyme from 2012 to 2021 regularly, but with a focus on the whole airway abnormalities of these patients visualized through FB. The long-term clinical outcomes and relevant airway symptoms were assessed. Pulmonary function test and polysomnography were performed to evaluate the degree of respiratory compromise. All patients in the study had varying degrees of airway collapsibility, pulmonary complications, sleep apnea syndrome, and facial anomalies. Pulmonary function could preserve after Myozyme treatment, but potential deterioration thereafter. This is the first study that focuses on airway abnormalities and pulmonary complications in long-term treated LOPD patients using FB. Despite years of Myozyme treatment, we still observed airway abnormalities in these patients.

Methods:   From January 2004 to December 2019, 471 patients with an RNS of 7-9 (moderate) and 164 patients with an RNS of 10-12 (high) who underwent PN were analyzed for renal function outcomes. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured using a DTPA scan and calculated the GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, respectively. Trifecta/pentafecta outcome, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were compared after propensity score matched analysis (PSMA).  Results:   After PSMA, 156 cases in each group were matched without significant difference in the preoperative factor. At the postoperative first year, there was no significant difference in the trifecta (p = 0.320), MDRD-based (p = 0.729), or DTPA-based pentafecta achievement rate (p = 0.964) between groups. At postoperative 5 years, DTPA-based total GFR (93.6% vs. 93.8%) and the operated kidney GFR preservation rate (89.9% vs. 81.7%) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences in survival outcomes (p > 0.05). Significant predictors of de novo chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or higher at the postoperative first year were age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.17, p = 0.005] and preoperative DTPA-based total GFR (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.98, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   High complex tumors can be treated with PN without significant deterioration in renal function. The postoperative function of the operated kidney was preserved by up to 80% in the long term compared with the preoperative period.

Given the morbidity of esophagectomy and the possibility of pCR with ChemoRT, a 'watch and wait' strategy has been proposed, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma. The ability to accurately predict which patients will have pCR from ChemoRT is critical in treatment decision making. This study assessed positron emission tomography (PET) in predicting pCR after neoadjuvant ChemoRT for ESCC.  Methods:   ESCC patients treated with ChemoRT followed by surgery were identified. Maximum standard uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis, and first-order textual features of standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness were measured from PET. Univariable and multivariable generalized linear method analyses were performed. A metabolic complete response (mCR) was defined as a post-therapy PET scan with maximum SUV < 4.0.  Results:   Twenty-seven patients underwent ChemoRT followed by surgery, with overall pCR seen in 11 (41%) patients and radiographic mCR seen in 12 (44%) patients. Final pathology for these 12 patients revealed pCR (ypT0N0M0) in 5 (42%) patients and persistent disease in 7 (58%) patients. Univariate analysis did not reveal PET parameters predictive of pCR.  Conclusion:   Treatment of ESCC with ChemoRT often results in a robust clinical response. Among patients with an mCR after ChemoRT, disease persistence was found in 58%. The inability of PET to predict pCR is important in the context of a 'watch and wait' strategy for ESCC treated with ChemoRT.""","""['M Hart Squires', 'Nicole Gower', 'Jennifer H Benbow', 'Erin E Donahue', 'Casey E Bohl', 'Roshan S Prabhu', 'Joshua S Hill', 'Jonathan C Salo']""","""[' Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, Carolinas Medical Center, Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', ' LCI Research Support, Clinical Trials Office, Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas Medical Center, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Carolinas Medical Center, Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', ' Charlotte Radiology, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', ' Southeast Radiation Oncology Group, Carolinas Medical Center, Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', ' Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, Carolinas Medical Center, Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.

The preoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio has recently been shown to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, but its prognostic value remains unclear in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.  Objective:   This study aimed to examine the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio.  Design:   This is a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database.  Settings:   This study was conducted at a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary cancer center in Japan.  Patients:   The subjects were 756 consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who received systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to compare the prognostic impact of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio with the impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, or the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcomes measured were the correlations of prognostic scores with overall survival.  Results:   Median survival times of patients with high, intermediate, and low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratios were 29.4, 19.3, and 13.1 months (p < 0.001). In all subgroups according to key prognostic factors (performance status, use of targeted agents, pretreatment CEA levels, tumor sidedness, M category, and primary tumor resection), patient prognosis could be clearly stratified into 3 groups by the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was independently associated with reduced survival (low vs high: HR 1.96, p < 0.001; intermediate vs high: HR 1.44, p < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was the most sensitive predictor of survival among all inflammation-based prognostic scores on a continuous basis.  Limitations:   This study was retrospective in nature.  Conclusions:   The lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio is a useful prognostic biomarker for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer and could contribute to accurate prognostication and therapeutic decision making.

Relacin entre linfocitos y protena c es el score pronostico inflamatorio mas sensible en pacientes con cncer colorrectal metastsico irresecable:   ANTECEDENTES:La inflamación sistémica contribuye en la progresión de neoplasias malignas. Recientemente se ha demostrado que la proporción preoperatoria de linfocitos -proteína C reactiva predice la supervivencia de los pacientes con cáncer colorrectal que se sometieron a cirugía, pero su valor pronóstico sigue sin estar claro en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronostico de los scores inflamtorios centrandose en linfocito- proteina c reactiva en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico.DISEÑO:Estudio retrospective evaluando una base de datos.AJUSTE:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un centro oncológico terciario multidisciplinario de gran volumen en Japón.PACIENTES:Se incluyeron 756 pacientes consecutivos todos con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable que recibieron quimioterapia sistémica de 2000 a 2015. El valor pronóstico de la proteína C reactiva se evaluó mediante análisis univariables y multivariables. Se realizó análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo para comparar el impacto pronóstico de la proteína linfocito-C-reactiva con el de la proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos, la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos, la proporción de linfocitos a monocitos o la proporción de puntuación pronóstica segun escala de Glasgow modificada.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Correlacion de las puntuaciones pronósticas con la supervivencia global.RESULTADOS:La mediana de supervivencia de los pacientes con niveles altos, intermedios y bajos de proteína C reactiva de linfocitos fue de 29,4, 19,3 y 13,1 meses, respectivamente (p <0,001). En todos los subgrupos de acuerdo con los factores pronósticos clave (estado funcional, uso de agentes dirigidos, niveles de antígeno carcinoembrionario antes del tratamiento, lado del tumor, categoría M y resección del tumor primario), el pronóstico del paciente podría estratificarse claramente en tres grupos por linfocito a C- proteína reactiva. El análisis multivariable reveló que la disminución de linfocitos a proteína C reactiva se asoció de forma independiente con una supervivencia reducida (baja frente a alta: cociente de riesgo 1,96, p <0,001; intermedio frente a alto: cociente de riesgo 1,44, p <0,001). El análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo reveló que de linfocito a proteína C reactiva era el predictor de supervivencia más sensible entre todas las puntuaciones de pronóstico basadas en inflamación de forma continua.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio fue de naturaleza retrospectiva.CONCLUSIONES:La proteína C reactiva de linfocitos a C es un biomarcador pronóstico útil para el cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable y podría contribuir a un pronóstico preciso y a la toma de decisiones terapéuticas.

Methods:   This was a retrospective study conducted between 2007 and 2020 with 118 patients with Rutherford class 3 (34.7%), class 4 (40.7%), and class 5 (24.6%) symptoms owing to infraaortic subacute thrombotic occlusion who were treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis.  Results:   Immediate technical success (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 2/3) was achieved in 56%, overall technical success after all adjunctive procedures was seen in 83.9%. Clinical success was obtained in 74.5% within 30 days. Major bleeding occurred in 11.8%. When we excluded access site hematomas, the rate of major bleeding was 5.1%. In-hospital mortality rate was 5.1%, and the amputation rate within 30 days was 12.7%. Any-degree malnutrition was detected in 48.3% according to CONUT score (≥2). Any-degree malnutrition was associated with failed thrombolysis and bleeding. The CONUT score predicted insufficient lytic response even after adjustment for confounding factors; however, serum C-reactive protein or neutrophil/lenfosit ratio did not. Other predictors of immediate technical failure after thrombolysis were symptom duration, Rutherford class 4/5 symptoms, and worsened distal runoff.  Conclusion:   In patients with subacute limb ischemia, CDT combined with adjunctive interventions was effective in many patients at the expense of a substantial risk of bleeding and death. Malnutrition was associated with insufficient lytic response and bleeding.

Methods:   We performed a single-center, retrospective study of 10 consecutive patients (8 men and 2 women aged 29-70 years) with postoperative BPF receiving the VSD occluder treatment. We used the HeartR™ Membranous VSD occluder (Lifetech Scientific Co., Shenzhen, China) for the closure of BPF through flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Demographic characteristics, BPF characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected from patients' files using the standardized data abstraction forms.  Results:   The underlying diseases were lung cancer in 6 patients, pulmonary tuberculosis in 3, and bronchiectasis in 1. Right-sided BPFs occurred in 6 patients, and left-sided BPFs occurred in 4. Five patients were underweight with a body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2.

However, reports regarding the outcomes of surgery vary considerably by institution. Here, we investigated the surgical outcomes and risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes after surgery.  Methods:   We analyzed patients with NTM-PD who underwent pulmonary resection at Seoul National University Hospital between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2020, and assessed the types of surgical procedures, complications, and long-term outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors associated with treatment refractoriness or recurrence after surgery.  Results:   Among 67 patients who underwent surgery during the study period, the most common indication for surgery was persistent culture positivity despite rigorous medical treatment (80.6%), followed by longstanding cavitary lesions or radiographic aggravation (10.4%) and massive hemoptysis (4.5%). Among 53 patients with positive mycobacterial cultures at the time of surgery, 38 (71.7%) achieved initial negative culture conversion, 9 (17.0%) of whom experienced recurrence. Nine (13.4%) patients experienced postoperative complications, which were managed without lasting morbidity and mortality.

The top recommendations (total n, frequency of recommendation) were penile rehabilitation (2253, 84%), pleasure-focus (1887, 71%), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (1655, 62%), clinical counselor (1603, 60%), vacuum erectile device (1418, 53%) and intracavernosal injections (1383, 52%).  Conclusions:   Biopsychosocial programs are evolving to be a key part of prostate cancer survivorship. This study's insight suggests that prostate cancer survivors require education around their sexual consequences and psychosexual counseling alongside proven biomedical strategies for erectile dysfunction.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Cancer survivorship programs should integrate educational and psychosocial strategies alongside biological strategies for prostate cancer survivors and their partners.""","""['Wallace Yuen', 'Luke Witherspoon', 'Eugenia Wu', 'Julie Wong', 'Sara Sheikholeslami', 'Jenna Bentley', 'Christine Zarowski', 'Monita Sundar', 'Stacy Elliott', 'Celestia Higano', 'Ryan Flannigan']""","""[' Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Gordon & Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre, Level 6, 2775 Laurel Street, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1M9, Canada.', ' Prostate Cancer Supportive Care Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ' Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', ' Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Gordon & Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre, Level 6, 2775 Laurel Street, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1M9, Canada. ryan.flannigan@ubc.ca.', ' Prostate Cancer Supportive Care Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada. ryan.flannigan@ubc.ca.', ' Department of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. ryan.flannigan@ubc.ca.']""","""2022""","""2022 Feb""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Sexual rehabilitation and cancer survivorship: a state of art review of current literature and management strategies in male sexual dysfunction among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Sexual Rehabilitation After Treatment For Prostate Cancer-Part 2: Recommendations From the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2015).', 'The Prostate Cancer Rehabilitation Clinic: a biopsychosocial clinic for sexual dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'Guidelines for Sexual Health Care for Prostate Cancer Patients: Recommendations of an International Panel.', 'Prostate cancer survivorship: a review of erectile dysfunction and penile rehabilitation after prostate cancer therapy.', ""Predictors of prostate cancer survivors' engagement in self-management behaviors.""]"""

We hypothesized that airway cytology differs between API positive (API+)/negative (API-) children with uncontrolled/recurrent wheezing with dominance of eosinophils in API+ and neutrophils in API- groups respectively. The main objective of this study is to compare bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell profiles in API+/API- children with recurrent wheezing unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).  Design:   Retrospective analysis of BAL in 43 children, 3-36 months (median: 14 months) receiving ICS (31 API+, 12 API-). BAL cell differential counts, bacterial/viral cultures, and lipid-laden macrophage percentages were analyzed. Cell counts presented as median (range).  Results:   Neutrophil percentages were increased in both groups (API- 16% [1%-76%]; API+ 42% [1%-95%]; p = NS). Cell percentages were similar for lymphocytes (API- 12% [1%-30%]; API+ 7% [1%-37%]), and macrophages (API- 67.5% [12%-97%]; API+ 41% [2%-94%]). Eosinophil percentages were low in both groups (API- 1% [1%-2%]; API+ 1% [1%-11%]). There was no difference in cellular distributions using absolute cell counts comparing API groups. Bacterial cultures were positive in 18 (60%) API+ and 5 (41%) API- patients (p = 0.10).  Conclusion:   Cell profiles do not differ between API groups in children ≤36 months with recurrent wheezing unresponsive to ICS. Neutrophil percentages and total granulocyte count correlate with positive bacterial cultures independent of API status. Persistent bacterial bronchitis likely plays an important role in the persistence of symptoms unresponsive to ICS therapy regardless of API status with a trend to more positive cultures in API positive children.""","""['Dima Ezmigna', 'Mark Brown', 'Cori Daines', 'Wayne Morgan']""","""[' Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', "" Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA."", ' Department of Pediatrics, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Pulmonol""","""['Bronchoalveolar cells in children < 3 years old with severe recurrent wheezing.', 'Eosinophil cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in early childhood wheezing: is it predictive of future asthma?', 'Associations between patient clinical characteristics and the presence of cytomegalovirus DNA in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of children with recurrent wheezing.', 'Daily vs. intermittent inhaled corticosteroids for recurrent wheezing and mild persistent asthma: a systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Neutrophilic Steroid-Refractory Recurrent Wheeze and Eosinophilic Steroid-Refractory Asthma in Children.']"""

Methods:   The clinical data of 78 patients with skull defects with hydrocephalus were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were treated with cranioplasty and ventriculoperitoneal shunts in 1 stage, including 35 cases of cranioplasty combined with ipsilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunts (ipsilateral operation group) and 43 cases of contralateral operations (contralateral operation group).  Results:   The incision length (28.97 ± 4.55 cm), operation time (139.00 ± 42.27 minutes), and intraoperative hemorrhage (174.57 ± 79.35 mL) in the ipsilateral operation group were significantly better than those in the contralateral operation group (respectively they were 37.15 ± 5.83 cm, 214.07 ± 34.35 minutes, and 257.21 ± 72.02 mL), and the difference was statistically significant (t = 6.786, 8.656, and 4.815, all P < 0.05). The degree of postoperative hydrocephalus was significantly improved in both groups, but there was no statistically significant difference in the degree of hydrocephalus between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Among the postoperative complications, there was no statistically significant difference in infection, epilepsy, subdural effusion, titanium plate effusion, or excessive cerebrospinal fluid drainage between the 2 groups (P > 0.05), but the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in the ipsilateral operation group (2.86%) was significantly lower than that in the contralateral operation group (20.93%, χ2 = 4.138, P = 0.042). The postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores of the 2 groups were improved compared with those before the operation (P < 0.05), and there was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores (P > 0.05). At 6 months after surgery, there was no statistically significant difference in Glasgow Outcome Scale effectiveness between the 2 groups (χ2 = 0.005, P = 0.944).

Methods:   Retrospective chart analysis was performed on patients found to have apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) > 100 events/h. Patients with chronic diseases other than obesity were excluded.  Results:   Forty-one subjects were studied, average age of 11.4 ± 4.3 years, majority (73.1%) were Hispanic, with a mean total AHI (TAHI) of 128.1 ± 22.9/h. Twenty-eight (68.3%) patients underwent AT. Lower age (P < 0.001), lower BMI Z-score (P < 0.01), higher OAHI (P < 0.05) were associated with having surgery. Eleven out of 28 (39.3%) surgical patients required respiratory support (oxygen or positive airway pressure) postoperatively. Longer % total sleep time SpO2 <90% during PSG (P < 0.05) and lower SpO2 nadir (P < 0.05) were associated with requiring airway support. No patients experienced mortality, reintubation, or hospital readmission following AT, with majority (71.4%) discharged 1 day post-operatively. Eleven (57.9%) of the 19 patients who had a postoperative PSG had residual OSA, defined as AHI >5 events/h, but there was a significant improvement in TAHI (P < 0.01).  Conclusion:   Our findings confirm the need for postoperative observation in a controlled setting for patients with extreme OSA undergoing AT. Although at higher risk of needing respiratory support, those patients undergoing AT for extreme OSA did not require re-intubation post-operatively or suffer serious harm.

We aimed to investigate whether sarcopenia at the time of chemotherapy induction in patients with urothelial carcinoma is associated with prognosis.  Methods:   We evaluated patients treated with chemotherapy for urothelial carcinoma between April 2013 and February 2018 at our institution and affiliated centers. Skeletal muscle mass (total psoas muscle, paraspinal muscle, and total skeletal muscle areas) were used to calculate the total psoas muscle index, paraspinal muscle index, and skeletal muscle index. All participants were grouped as per cutoff points set at the median value for each sex. Overall survival was evaluated using Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Of the 240 patients, 171 were men and 69 were women; mean age during chemotherapy was 71 years (range: 43-88); and 36, 56, and 148 patients were at stages II, III, and IV, respectively.

Methods:   Preoperative transferrin levels, calculated by summing serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity, were evaluated in 224 patients who underwent esophagectomy for stage I-III esophageal cancer without preoperative treatment. Transferrin levels are directly proportional to total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and we defined TIBC < 250 μg/dL as low transferrin. We evaluated the relationship between preoperative transferrin levels and short- and long-term outcomes after esophagectomy using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.  Results:   Of all patients, 25 (11.2%) had low preoperative transferrin levels. Low preoperative transferrin levels were strongly correlated with worse preoperative performance status, advanced pathological T stage, and more open esophagectomy (p = 0.0078, 0.0001, and 0.013, respectively). Patients with low preoperative transferrin levels experienced significantly more frequent postoperative pneumonia in univariate and multivariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 3.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.032-10.033, p = 0.0443]. Additionally, these patients were significantly correlated with worse overall survival (OS) in univariate and multivariate analyses (HR 2.75, 95% CI 1.018-7.426, p = 0.0460). Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between OS and postoperative pneumonia to elucidate why low preoperative transferrin, which is an independent risk factor for postoperative pneumonia, leads to poor prognosis.

The aim of the study was to assess the ability of PCT or CRP combined with clinical characteristics to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections in hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) adults with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).  Methods:   This was a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial previously conducted among LRTI patients. The ability of PCT, CRP and PCT or CRP combined with clinical symptoms to discriminate between viral and bacterial infection were assessed by portraying receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves among patients with only a viral or a typical bacterial infection.  Results:   In total, 209 infected patients (viral 69%, bacterial 31%) were included in the study. When using CRP or PCT to discriminate between viral and bacterial LRTI, the optimal cut-off points were 22 mg/L and 0.18 ng/mL, respectively. When the optimal cut-off for CRP (≤ 22 mg/L) or PCT (≤ 0.18 ng/mL) combined with rhinorrhea was used to discriminate viral from bacterial LRTI, the AUCs were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75-0.87) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86), which was statistically significantly better than when CRP or PCT used alone (p < 0.001). When CRP ≤ 22 mg/L, PCT ≤ 0.18 ng/mL and rhinorrhea were combined, the AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91), which was statistically significantly higher than when CRP (≤ 22 mg/L) or PCT (≤ 0.18 ng/mL) was combined with rhinorrhea (p = 0.011 and p = 0.021).

In literature, most esthetic outcomes are based on instinctive analysis of the esthetic surgeon, rather than on patient assessments, public opinions, or other objective means. We employed an artificial intelligence system to objectively measure the impact of brow lifts and associated rejuvenation procedures on the appearance of emotion while the patient is in repose.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent bilateral brow lift for visual field obstruction between 2006 and 2019. Images were analyzed using a commercially available facial expression recognition software package (FaceReader™, Noldus Information Technology BV, Wageningen, Netherlands). The data generated reflected the proportion of each emotion expressed for any given facial movement and the action units associated.  Results:   A total of 52 cases were identified after exclusion. Pre-operatively, the angry, happy, sad, scared, and surprised emotion were detected on average of 13.06%, 1.68%, 13.06%, 3.53%, and 0.97% among all the patients, respectively. Post-operatively, the angry emotion average decreased to 5.42% (p=0.009). The happy emotion increased to 9.35% (p=0.0013), while the sad emotion decreased to 5.42%. The scared emotion remained relatively the same at 3.4%, and the surprised emotion increased to 2.01%; however, these were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   This study proposes a paradigm shift in the clinical evaluation of brow lift and other facial esthetic surgery, implementing an existing facial emotion recognition system to quantify changes in expression associated with facial surgery.

We have noticed the pathogenicity of Mucorales is closely related to energy metabolism, while mitochondria play the role of energy factories in almost all biological activities.  Methods:   Virulence of M irregularis, M hiemalis, L corymbifera and R arrhizus were verified in Galleria mellonella larvae, as well as mitochondrial gene copies analysed with RT-qPCR. Mitogenomes of the four Mucorales species were sequenced based on illumina NovaSeq technology to study their characteristic features and functional regions.  Results:   Variant virulence of M irregularis, M hiemalis, L corymbifera and R arrhizu were verified by clinical retrospective data and our G mellonella infection models, also copies of mitochondrial genes indicated the significant associations with pathogenicity. A total of 274.18 clean reads were generated to be assembled; the complete mitogenomes of the four Mucorales species were obtained with totally different length. After the genomes annotated and compared, M irregularis was found more similar with M hiemalis than those of L corymbifera and R arrhizus, especially the small (rrns) and large (rrnl) subunits of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The GC content, ncRNAs and the distribution of the SNPs and InDels were also compared, and the GC content rate of fungi seems to be related to the fungal thermal adaptability. In addition, linear mitogenomes of these four Mucorales showed diverse arrangements of orf genes and directionality of some conserved gene elements.  Conclusion:   This study uncovered the pathogenicity variances among the four Mucorales species and the relationship between their mitogenomic features and clinical pathogenicity.

In this study we developed individualized computational models based upon structural brain networks to explore the impact of different virtual resections on the propagation of seizures. The propagation of seizures was modelled as an epidemic process [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model] on individual structural networks derived from presurgical diffusion tensor imaging in 19 patients. The candidate connections for the virtual resection were all connections from the clinically hypothesized EZ, from which the seizures were modelled to start, to other brain areas. As a computationally feasible surrogate for the SIR model, we also removed the connections that maximally reduced the eigenvector centrality (EC) (large values indicate network hubs) of the hypothesized EZ, with a large reduction meaning a large effect. The optimal combination of connections to be removed for a maximal effect were found using simulated annealing. For comparison, the same number of connections were removed randomly, or based on measures that quantify the importance of a node or connection within the network. We found that 90% of the effect (defined as reduction of EC of the hypothesized EZ) could already be obtained by removing substantially less than 90% of the connections. Thus, a smaller, optimized, virtual resection achieved almost the same effect as the actual surgery yet at a considerably smaller cost, sparing on average 27.49% (standard deviation: 4.65%) of the connections. Furthermore, the maximally effective connections linked the hypothesized EZ to hubs. Finally, the optimized resection was equally or more effective than removal based on structural network characteristics both regarding reducing the EC of the hypothesized EZ and seizure spreading. The approach of using reduced EC as a surrogate for simulating seizure propagation can suggest more restrictive resection strategies, whilst obtaining an almost optimal effect on reducing seizure propagation, by taking into account the unique topology of individual structural brain networks of patients.""","""['Ida A Nissen', 'Ana P Millán', 'Cornelis J Stam', 'Elisabeth C W van Straaten', 'Linda Douw', 'Petra J W Pouwels', 'Sander Idema', 'Johannes C Baayen', 'Demetrios Velis', 'Piet Van Mieghem', 'Arjan Hillebrand']""","""[' Department of Clinical Neurophysiology and MEG Center, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Clinical Neurophysiology and MEG Center, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.p.millanvidal@amsterdamumc.nl.', ' Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Sci Rep""","""['Epidemic models characterize seizure propagation and the effects of epilepsy surgery in individualized brain networks based on MEG and invasive EEG recordings.', 'Multitier Network Analysis Using Resting-state Functional MRI for Epilepsy Surgery.', 'Transient seizure onset network for localization of epileptogenic zone: effective connectivity and graph theory-based analyses of ECoG data in temporal lobe epilepsy.', 'Seizure outcome of epilepsy surgery in focal epilepsies associated with temporomesial glioneuronal tumors: lesionectomy compared with tailored resection.', 'Magnetic source imaging and ictal SPECT in MRI-negative neocortical epilepsies: additional value and comparison with intracranial EEG.', 'Virtual epileptic patient brain modeling: Relationships with seizure onset and surgical outcome.', 'Epidemic models characterize seizure propagation and the effects of epilepsy surgery in individualized brain networks based on MEG and invasive EEG recordings.']"""

Methods:   We queried the National Cancer Database for all surgically staged, stage 3 patients between 2012 and 2016. Patients who received any pre-operative therapy were excluded. Demographics, tumor factors, and adjuvant therapy for the stage 3 substages were compared. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with adjuvant therapy. Kaplan Meier curves were generated and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used to adjust for prognostic factors. Findings with p < 0.05 were considered significant.  Results:   Of 7363 patients with stage 3 disease, 478 (6%) had stage 3B; 1732 (23%) had stage 3A, 3457 (48%) had stage 3C1, and 1696 (23%) had stage 3C2 disease. Post-surgical treatment consisted of: combined chemotherapy (CT) and radiation (RT) (49%), CT alone (28%), RT alone (9%), 14% received no postoperative therapy. Among all stage 3 substages, patients with stage 3B disease were the least likely to receive any CT, and the most likely to receive RT alone. After adjusting for known prognostic factors, patients with stage 3A (Hazard ratio (HR) of death = 0.64) and 3C1 (HR of death = 0.79) disease had significantly worse overall survival compared to stage 3B; survival was not demonstrably different from patients with stage 3C2 disease. Patients with stage 3B disease who received CT + RT had the best overall survival.  Conclusion:   Survival of patients with stage 3B disease is similar to that of patients with para-aortic node metastases and is inferior to all others with stage 3 endometrial cancer.

A total of 14 children who had MFBM were collected, the proportion between urban and rural areas was 8:6, and the ratio of male to female was 6:1. The age ranged from 1.2 to 8.9 years (median 4.6 years). The number of magnetic foreign bodies ingested by mistake is 1 to 17 (average 6.5). Magnetic foreign objects are divided into magnets (3 cases) + magnetic beads (11 cases). About 40% (5/14) of this patient series showed no available misingestion history. Management includes: 4 cases of open surgery (including 1 case of laparoscopic transfer to operation), 3 cases of laparoscopic surgery, 2 cases of gastroscopy, 5 cases of conservative treatment of foreign bodies discharged through the anus. Of the 7 surgical cases, 6 cases presented with intestinal obstruction and intestinal perforation (at least 1 intestinal perforation and at most 5). Abdominal sonography has limitations in the detection of magnetic foreign bodies in the digestive tract. The proportion of laparoscopic surgery in the 7 surgical cases is nearly half. All surgical cases recovered smoothly after treatment. Our experience shows that MFBM is a big issue for the small children! The early symptoms of MFBM are often atypical especially among young children and MFBM may lead to severe adverse events. We proposed a management strategy for MFBM in children.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 501 consecutive patients with FILD who underwent clinical assessment, including pulmonary function test and CAT. The association between CAT score and 3-year mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazard analysis, Kaplan-Meier plots, and the log-rank test for trend. To handle missing data, the imputed method was used.  Results:   The patients' median age was 68 years, and 320 were male (63.9%). Regarding CAT severity, 203 patients had a low impact level (score <10), 195 had a medium level (10-20), 80 had a high level (21-30), and 23 had a very high level (31-40). During the 3-year study period, 118 patients died. After adjusting for age, sex, forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, IPF diagnosis, and usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution computed tomography, the CAT score was significantly associated with 3-year mortality (hazard ratio in increments of 10 points: 1.458, 95% confidence interval 1.161-1.830; p < 0.001). In addition, patients with high and very high impact levels had twofold and threefold higher mortality risk than those with low levels, respectively.  Conclusion:   The CAT has prognostic value in FILD.""","""['Toshiaki Matsuda', 'Yasuhiro Kondoh', 'Taiki Furukawa', 'Atsushi Suzuki', 'Reoto Takei', 'Hajime Sasano', 'Yasuhiko Yamano', 'Toshiki Yokoyama', 'Kensuke Kataoka', 'Tomoki Kimura']""","""[' Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Tosei General Hospital, Seto, Aichi, Japan.', ' Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Tosei General Hospital, Seto, Aichi, Japan.

Given the increasing prevalence of craniosynostosis and the use of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) method, the authors evaluated the association between IVF and the prevalence of craniosynostosis.  Methods:   This retrospective study reviewed records of patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis who underwent surgery in Mofid Hospital, a tertiary children's hospital affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, between 2010 and 2019.  Results:   A total of 200 patients aged one month to 7 years old, were evaluated. Out of 200 patients, 43% were plagiocephalic, 39% trigonocephalic, 8.5% scaphocephalic, 8% brachiocephalic, and 1.5% were mixed. Nine (4.5%) patients had received clomiphene citrate. Eight (4%) mothers had become pregnant under IVF, and they all had used clomiphene citrate for ovulation stimulation. No use of artificial insemination was reported. Of the eight patients whose mother had become pregnant through IVF, three were trigonocephalic, and five were plagiocephalic.  Conclusions:   Without a control group, we are not able report the statistical results confirming or denying a link between craniosynostosis and infertility treatment. However, 4% prevalence of IVF use among craniosynostosis patients is significant.

This is the first study to use ICD-10 codes to investigate disparities in the surgical management for craniosynostosis.  Methods:   Using the Kids' Inpatient Database univariable analyses were performed to compare the relative odds of undergoing strip craniectomy, either endoscopic (ESC) or open (OSC), or calvarial vault remodeling (CVR) based on a variety of demographic and hospital-level variables.  Results:   Of the 2,874 patients identified, 2,352 underwent CVR while 522 underwent SC. Of those undergoing SC, 295 and 228 had an endoscopic and open procedure, respectively. A greater proportion of patients who had private insurance (58.14% versus 47.49%) or were self-pay (8.06% versus 6.28%) underwent SC, whereas a higher percentage who were covered under Medicaid (46.23% versus 32.8%; P < 0.001) received CVR. ESC patients were 2.16 times more likely to have private insurance and 2.07 times more likely to be from the highest income quartile compared to OSC patients. However, there were no differences in terms of insurance type or income level between those undergoing CVR compared to OSC.  Conclusions:   Our study found that the difference between CVR and SC can be attributed to the difference in the endoscopic versus open approaches to SC.

While previous studies have demonstrated a significant association between urban air pollution and hospitalization for AECOPD, there is a lack of research on the impact of particulate matter (PM) on inflammation and coagulation in AECOPD inpatients. Therefore, this study investigated the association of changes in coagulation function and C-reactive protein (CRP) with PM levels in the days preceding hospitalization.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed the medical records of AECOPD patients admitted to Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, between March 2017 and September 2019. We analyzed the association of coagulation function and CRP level in AECOPD patients with PM levels in the days before hospitalization. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of CRP data with hospitalization day. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate mean aerodynamic diameter of ≥ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) exposure on the day before hospitalization; we assessed its association with changes in prothrombin time (PT) in AECOPD inpatients with different Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classes.  Results:   The peripheral blood PT of AECOPD patients with PM2.5 ≥ 25 mg/L on the day before hospitalization were lower than those of patients with PM2.5 < 25 mg/L (t = 2.052, p = 0.041). Patients with severe GOLD class exposed to greater than 25 mg/L of PM2.5on the day before hospitalization showed significant differences in PT (F = 9.683, p = 0.008). Peripheral blood CRP levels of AECOPD patients exposed to PM2.5 ≥ 25 mg/L and PM10 ≥ 50 mg/L on the day before hospitalization were higher than those of patients exposed to PM2.5 < 25 mg/L and PM10 < 50 mg/L (t = 2.008, p = 0.046; t = 2.637, p = 0.009). Exposure to < 25 mg/L of PM2.5 on the day before hospitalization was significantly associated with CRP levels (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.101, 3.315; p = 0.024).  Conclusion:   Exposure of patients with AECOPD to high PM levels on the day before hospitalization was associated with an increased CRP level and shortened PT. Moreover, PM2.5 had a greater effect on CRP level and PT than mean aerodynamic diameter of ≥ 10 μm (PM10).

And factors contributing to recurrence after treatment are poorly understood. Herein, we sought to develop a novel clinical nomogram to predict ureteral stricture-free survival in patients suffering from ureter stricture and performed balloon dilation.  Methods:   The nomogram was established based on a retrospective analysis of 321 patients who received endoscopic balloon dilation alone for ureter strictures from January 2016 to January 2020 in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital using the Cox regression model. Perioperative clinical data and disease outcomes were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the onset of ureteral re-stricture after ureter balloon dilation. Discrimination of the nomogram was assessed by the concordance index (C-index) and the calibration curve. The results were internally validated using bootstrap resampling.  Results:   Overall, 321 patients with a median follow-up of 590 days were enrolled in the study, among which 97 patients (30.2%) developed recurrence of ureteral stricture during follow-up. Five variables remained significant predictors of ureteral re-stricture after multivariable analyses: stricture nature (P < 0.001), urinary nitrite (P = 0.041), CKD (P = 0.005), stent retention time (P < 0.001), and balloon size (P = 0.029). The calibration craves for the probability of 1-, 3-, and 5-years stricture-free survival (SFS) presented satisfied with the consistency of nomogram prediction and actual observation.

Methods:   This retrospective study collected data from 312 patients who underwent transrectal prostate biopsies between January 2019 and August 2020. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the site of local anesthesia (base vs. base and apex PNB), with each block achieved with 2.5 cm3 of 2% lidocaine. Pain scores were assessed using the visual analog scale at the following time points: probe insertion, PNB at base, PNB at apex, each of the 12 core biopsy sites, and 15 min after biopsy. The results were analyzed using a linear mixed model.  Results:   The average pain scores were significantly higher in the base-only PNB group than were those in the base and apex PNB group (3.88 vs 2.82, p < 0.001). In the base-only PNB group, the pain scores increased from base to apex (p < 0.001), and the pain at each site also gradually increased as the biopsy proceeded (p < 0.001). In contrast, in the base and apex PNB group, there was minor change in pain scores throughout the procedure.  Conclusions:   The pain scores varied at each site during the prostate biopsy.

We investigated the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in predicting postoperative AE in IPF.  Method:   Clinical data of 48 IPF patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before thoracic surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Mean and maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively) were measured in the fibrotic area. Additionally, adjusted values-SUV ratio (SUVR, defined as SUVmax-to-liver SUVmean ratio), tissue fraction-corrected SUVmean (SUVmeanTF), and SUVR (SUVRTF)-were calculated.  Results:   The mean age of the subjects was 67.8 years and 91.7% were male. After thoracic surgery, 21 (43.8%) patients experienced postoperative complications including prolonged air leakage (29.2%), death (14.6%), and AE (12.5%) within 30 days. Patients who experienced AE showed higher SUVmax, SUVR, SUVmeanTF, and SUVRTF than those who did not, but other clinical parameters were not different between patients with and without AE. The SUV parameters did not differ for other complications. The SUVR (odds ratio [OR] 29.262; P = 0.030), SUVmeanTF (OR 3.709; P = 0.041) and SUVRTF (OR 20.592; P = 0.017) were significant predicting factors for postoperative AE following a multivariate logistic regression analysis. On receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, SUVRTF had the largest area under the curve (0.806, P = 0.007) for predicting postoperative AE among SUV parameters.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT may be useful in predicting postoperative AE in IPF patients and among SUVs, SUVRTF is the best parameter for predicting postoperative AE in IPF patients.""","""['Hee-Young Yoon', 'Suk Hyun Lee', 'Sejin Ha', 'Jin-Sook Ryu', 'Jin Woo Song']""","""[' Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Centre, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88 Olympic-Ro 43-Gil, Songpa-Gu, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Nuclear Medicine, Asan Medical Centre, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88 Olympic-Ro 43-Gil, Songpa-Gu, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.', ' Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Singil-ro, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, 07441, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Centre, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88 Olympic-Ro 43-Gil, Songpa-Gu, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea. jwsongasan@gmail.com.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""BMC Pulm Med""","""['The Value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in Evaluating Disease Severity and Prognosis in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients.', '18FFDG PET/CT predicts progression-free survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.', 'Is 18F-FDG PET/CT useful for the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?', 'Predictive value of 18F-FDG PET/CT for acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease in patients with lung cancer and interstitial lung disease treated with chemotherapy.', 'Correlation between preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and postoperative short-term prognosis in lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia after lung resection.', 'Prognostic Predictive Characteristics in Patients With Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

In these clinical cases, there were 3 male children and 1 female child, aged from 4.5 to 9.4 years old, with an average age of 6.5 years. An intraperitoneal laparoscopic partial cystectomy was performed in the treatment of 3 of these patients with benign bladder tumors and in 1 patient with an urachal cyst. The surgical procedures included a partial cystectomy and a complete intracavitary bladder suture.  Results:   All 4 cases were successful and no operation was transferred to opensurgery. The operation time was 100-120 min, with an average time of 108 min. The intraoperative blood loss was 10-20 ml, with an average loss of 15 ml. 6 h after the operation, the patients still maintained a fluid diet and 1 case of hematuria had occurred, with the catheter removed 12 days after the operation.

Age and comorbidities, assessed by the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), have been used to address chemotherapy intensity. In the ibrutinib era, it is still unclear whether age, CIRS, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) retain their predictive role on treatment vulnerability. In this series of 712 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with ibrutinib outside clinical trials, baseline ECOG-PS and neutropenia resulted as the most accurate predictors of treatment feasibility and outcomes. Age did not independently influence survival and ibrutinib tolerance, indicating that not age per se, but age-related conditions, may affect drug management. We confirmed the role of CIRS > 6 as a predictor of a poorer progression- and event-free survival (PFS, EFS). The presence of a severe comorbidity was significantly associated with permanent dose reductions (PDRs), not translating into worse outcomes. As expected, del(17p) and/or TP53mut and previous therapies affected PFS, EFS, and overall survival. No study so far has analyzed the influence of concomitant medications and CYP3A inhibitors with ibrutinib. In our series, these factors had no impact, although CYP3A4 inhibitors use correlated with Cox regression analysis, with an increased risk of PDR. Despite the limitation of its retrospective nature, this large study confirmed the role of ECOG-PS as the most accurate predictor of ibrutinib feasibility and outcomes, and importantly, neutropenia emerged as a relevant tool influencing patients' vulnerability.

A logistic regression and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were used to identify the acceptable number of SWL sessions prior to URS, regarding the intra-operative complications of URS.  Results:   The group 1 required more surgery time (41.38 ± 11.39 min vs. 36.43 ± 13.36 min, p = 0.01).

Results:   The operative time gradually decreased for both laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) (2013, 395 minutes; 2017, 278 minutes; P < .001; ρ = -0.68) and laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) (2013, 476 minutes; 2017, 319 minutes; P < .001; ρ = -0.56). The blood loss volume gradually decreased for both LDG (2013, 43.0 mL; 2017, 18.6 mL; P < .005; ρ = -0.30) and LTG (2013, 143.8 mL; 2017, 13.5 mL; P < .005; ρ = -0.41).

Methods:   This study included a total of 12 patients with renal tumors who were not preoperatively regarded as optimal candidates for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) and subsequently treated with RARN between April 2019 and June 2021 at our institution. Comprehensive perioperative outcomes in these patients were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   Of the 12 included patients, 10 and two were male and female, respectively, and the median age was 66 years. The median tumor diameter was 44 mm, and four, four and four patients were classified into cT1a, cT1b and cT3a, respectively. There was no patient requiring open conversion, and the median operative and console times were 167 and 79 minutes, respectively. The median estimated blood loss was 42 cc, and no patient required blood transfusion. During the perioperative period, no major complication corresponding to Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 occurred. Nine, two and one patient were pathologically diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma (CCC), non-CCC and benign cyst, respectively, and there was no patient who developed recurrent diseases.  Conclusions:   Considering complicated tumor characteristics not amenable to RAPN in this series, such as an intravenous tumor thrombus or previous history of open partial nephrectomy, perioperative outcomes of initial experience with RARN in Japan could be considered favorable.

Functional disability was evaluated using motor and cognitive Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores. Rehabilitation efficacy was assessed by FIM gains during rehabilitation and compared among the groups. There were no statistically significant dif-ferences in motor and cognitive FIM gains among the age groups. However, cognitive FIM gain was limited in a subset of ≥ 65 patients, and initial cognitive measures could not predict cognitive FIM improvement. These results indicate that chronological age is insufficient to accurately predict rehabilitation efficacy in older TBI patients, and that such patients should be considered candidates for intensive rehabilitation programs based on these results.

Because treatment strategies for bladder cancer and upper tract urothelial carcinoma are entirely different, urothelial carcinoma involving the ureterovesical junction requires special attention. Nevertheless, studies focusing on the disease are lacking.  Methods:   We reviewed consecutive patients with urothelial carcinoma treated via either transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n = 2791) or radical nephroureterectomy (n = 292) between 2000 and 2020 and identified those with bladder cancer involving the ureteral orifice (n = 64) and those with upper tract urothelial carcinoma involving the intramural ureter (≤2 cm) (n = 41). After excluding overlapping cases (n = 24), 80 patients with urothelial carcinoma involving the ureterovesical junction were analyzed.  Results:   The initial symptoms or reasons for diagnosing urothelial carcinoma involving the ureterovesical junction were hematuria (n = 30), hydronephrosis (n = 21), follow-up examinations for prior urothelial carcinoma (n = 13), screening examinations (n = 7), frequent urination (n = 6) and unknown causes (n = 3). During a median follow-up period of 42 months, 18 patients died of urothelial carcinoma. The definitive surgical treatments for urothelial carcinoma involving the ureterovesical junction were transurethral resection of bladder tumor alone (n = 26), radical nephroureterectomy (n = 41) and radical cystectomy (n = 13), with different treatments having different cancer-specific survivals. Multivariate analyses identified T stage (≥T2) as an independent predictor of shorter cancer-specific survival.

The use of ketorolac in spinal fusion is limited due to the risk of pseudarthrosis. However, recent literature suggests it may not affect fusion rates with short-term use and low doses.  Purpose:   We sought to demonstrate noninferiority regarding fusion rates in patients who received ketorolac after undergoing minimally invasive (MIS) posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Additionally, we sought to demonstrate ketorolac's opioid-sparing effect on analgesia in the immediate postoperative period.  Study design/setting:   This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. We are reporting our interim analysis.  Patient sample:   Adults with degenerative spinal conditions eligible to undergo a one to three-level MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).  Outcome measures:   Six-month and 1-year radiographic fusion as determined by Suk criteria, postoperative opioid consumption as measured by intravenous milligram morphine equivalent, length of stay, and drug-related complications. Self-reported and functional measures include validated visual analog scale, short-form 12, and Oswestry Disability Index.  Methods:   A double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial of patients undergoing 1- to 3-level MIS TLIF was performed with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Patients were randomized to receive a 48-hour scheduled treatment of either intravenous ketorolac (15 mg every 6 hours) or saline in addition to a standardized pain regimen. The primary outcome was fusion. Secondary outcomes included 48-hour and total postoperative opioid use demonstrated as milligram morphine equivalence, pain scores, length of stay (LOS), and quality-of-life outcomes. Univariate analyses were performed. The present study provides results from a planned interim analysis.  Results:   Two hundred and forty-six patients were analyzed per protocol. Patient characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in 1-year fusion rates between the two treatments (p=.53). The difference in proportion of solid fusion between the ketorolac and placebo groups did not reach inferiority (p=.072, 95% confidence interval, -.07 to .21). There was a significant reduction in total/48-hour mean opioid consumption (p<.001) and LOS (p=.001) for the ketorolac group while demonstrating equivalent mean pain scores in 48 hours postoperative (p=.20). There was no significant difference in rates of perioperative complications.

Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of the observed-to-expected total lung volume (O/E TLV) has been used as an adjunct to O/E LHR in predicting outcomes. Since O/E LHR only measures the contralateral lung, we sought to investigate if MRI measurements of the contralateral lung volume (O/E CLV) can accurately predict outcomes in CDH. We hypothesize that O/E CLV is a better predictor of CDH outcomes than O/E LHR.  Methods:   We identified all infants with a prenatal diagnosis of CDH at our fetal center who had both MRI and U/S measurements. Using lung volume ratios of right-left 55:45, we calculated O/E CLV from O/E TLV. We used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) to compare the predictive accuracy of O/E CLV to O/E LHR for ECMO support, as well as survival to both discharge and 1 year.  Results:   Seventy-four patients had complete prenatal imaging with 39% requiring ECMO support. The median O/E CLV was 48.0% and the median O/E LHR was 42.3%. O/E CLV was a better predictor of the need for ECMO support (AUC 0.81 vs. 0.74). O/E CLV was a better predictor of survival to discharge (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.64) and 1-year survival (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.63) than O/E LHR.  Conclusion:   O/E LHR is a well-validated standard for predicting outcomes and guiding prenatal counseling in CDH. We provide evidence that fetal MRI measurements of the contralateral lung volume corrected for gestational age were more accurate in predicting the need for ECMO and survival. Future prospective studies validating O/E CLV regarding outcomes and ECMO utilization are warranted.

PKDL patients are potential reservoirs of LD parasites, which can initiate a new epidemic of anthroponotic VL. Therefore, host infectiousness to its sand fly vector is a critical factor for transmission, and its accurate estimation can facilitate control strategies. At present, conventional microscopy serves as the reference method to detect parasites in its vector. However, low sensitivity of microscopy can be a limiting factor.  Methods:   In this study, real-time quantitative PCR (LD-qPCR) and recombinase polymerase amplification (LD-RPA) assays were evaluated against microscopy for the detection of LD DNA extracted from live sand flies five days after controlled feeding on PKDL cases.  Results:   The sensitivity of LD-qPCR and LD-RPA assays were found to be 96.43 and 100%, respectively, against microscopy for the selected fed sand flies (n = 28), and an absolute specificity of both molecular tools for apparently unfed sand flies (n = 30). While the proportion of infectious cases among 47 PKDL patients was estimated as 46.81% as defined by microscopic detection of LD in at least one fed sand fly per case, LD-RPA assay evaluation of only the microscopy negative sand flies fed to those 47 PKDL cases estimated an even greater proportion of infectious cases (51.06%). In overall estimation of the infectious cases in retrospective manner, discordance in positivity rate was observed (p < 0.05) between LD-RPA (59.57%) assay and microscopy (46.81%), while LD-RPA had slightly better positivity rate than LD-qPCR (55.32%) as well.  Conclusions:   Considering the sensitivity, cost, detection time, and field applicability, RPA assay can be considered as a promising single molecular detection tool for investigations pertaining to LD infections in sand flies and/or host infectiousness in PKDL, while it can also be useful in confirmation of microscopy negative sand fly samples.""","""['Md Anik Ashfaq Khan', 'Khaledul Faisal', 'Rajashree Chowdhury', 'Rupen Nath', 'Prakash Ghosh', 'Debashis Ghosh', 'Faria Hossain', 'Ahmed Abd El Wahed', 'Dinesh Mondal']""","""[' Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, University of Leipzig, An den Tierkliniken 43, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', ' Nutrition and Clinical Services Division, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research Bangladesh, 1212, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', ' Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, University of Leipzig, An den Tierkliniken 43, 04103, Leipzig, Germany. ahmed.abd_el_wahed@uni-leipzig.de.', ' Nutrition and Clinical Services Division, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research Bangladesh, 1212, Dhaka, Bangladesh. din63d@icddrb.org.', ' Laboratory Sciences and Services Division, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research Bangladesh, 1212, Dhaka, Bangladesh. din63d@icddrb.org.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Parasit Vectors""","""['Quantifying the Infectiousness of Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis Toward Sand Flies.', 'Xenodiagnosis to evaluate the infectiousness of humans to sandflies in an area endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar, India: a transmission-dynamics study.', 'Mobile suitcase laboratory for rapid detection of Leishmania donovani using recombinase polymerase amplification assay.', 'The Potential Use of Forensic DNA Methods Applied to Sand Fly Blood Meal Analysis to Identify the Infection Reservoirs of Anthroponotic Visceral Leishmaniasis.', 'Implication of vector characteristics of Phlebotomus argentipes in the kala-azar elimination programme in the Indian sub-continent.', 'Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification to Detect Infection Caused by Parasites of the Trypanosomatidae Family: A Literature Review and Opinion on the Laboratory to Field Applicability.']"""

The role of preoperative breast reconstruction information has not been widely popularized in China. It may play an important role in choosing immediate breast reconstruction. In this paper, we investigated whether there was an effect of the role of preoperative breast reconstruction information on the difference about choosing immediate breast reconstruction after modified radical mastectomy at signing the operation consent.  Methods:   From 2015 January to March 2018, newly admitted 100 patients with breast carcinoma must receive modified radical mastectomy. All these patients' conditions met the requirements of immediate breast reconstruction. Patient age, breast reconstruction cognition, marital status, education, and family economics were recorded. They were randomly classified into two groups (A & B). Preoperative breast reconstruction information was designed and prepared. When it came to signing operation consent, Group A received preoperative breast reconstruction information and Group B did not receive it. We recorded whether they were willing to receive immediate breast reconstruction in different groups.  Results:   There was no significant difference in patient age, breast reconstruction cognition, marital status, education, and family economics (P > 0.05). Thirty-two patients agreed to receive breast reconstruction and 18 patients did not agree to receive breast reconstruction in Group A when 24 patients agreed to receive breast reconstruction and 26 patients did not agree to receive breast reconstruction in Group B. There was a statistical significance (P < 0.05) between the above two groups.  Conclusion:   Preoperative breast reconstruction information may be a vital role for explaining about choosing immediate breast reconstruction after modified radical mastectomy at signing the operation consent.

However, the risk factors for LLNM remain unclear. The purpose of the study was to examine the risk factors for LLNM and construct a prediction model.  Methods:   With Ethics Committee approval, a total of 1198 PTC patients were retrospectively included in our study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationship between clinicopathological characteristics and LLNM. A nomogram for predicting LLNM in PTC patients with central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) was constructed and validated.  Results:   The negative BRAFV600E protein expression was significantly correlated with positive LLNM status in PTC patients. In PTC patients with CLNM, the number of metastatic central lymph nodes (LNN) ≥ 3 and the ratio of metastatic central lymph nodes (LNR) ≥ 0.565 were found to be significantly associated with positive LLNM status. The nomogram for predicting LLNM risk in PTC patients with CLNM incorporated four risk factors: tumor size, the BRAFV600E protein expression, LNN and LNR. The prediction model showed excellent discrimination, with a C-index of 0.714.  Conclusions:   The negative BRAFV600E protein expression was more likely to lead to LLNM.

We sought to evaluate these outcomes in patients with bicuspid native pulmonary valve (BNPV). Methods and Results A retrospective analysis of patients with transposition of the great arteries undergoing arterial switch operation at Boston Children's Hospital from 1989 to 2018 matched BNPV patients 1:3 with patients with tricuspid native pulmonary valve by year of arterial switch operation. Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank test compared groups for time to first neo-aortic valve reoperation, occurrence of ≥moderate AR, and neo-aortic root dilation (root z score ≥4). A total of 83 patients with BNPV were matched with 217 patients with tricuspid native pulmonary valve. Patients with BNPV more often had ventricular septal defects (73% versus 43%; P<0.001). Hospital length of stay (11 versus 10 days) and 30-day surgical mortality (3.6% versus 2.8%) were similar. During median 11 years follow-up, neo-aortic valve reoperation occurred in 4 patients with BNPV (6.0%) versus 6 patients with tricuspid native pulmonary valve (2.8%), with no significant difference in time to reoperation. More BNPV had AR at discharge (4.9% versus 0%; P=0.014) and during follow-up (13.4% versus 4.3%; hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; P=0.004), with shorter time to first occurrence of AR; this remained significant after adjusting for ventricular septal defects. Similarly, neo-aortic root dilation was more common in BNPV (45% versus 38%; HR, 1.64; P=0.026) with shorter time to first occurrence. Conclusions While patients with BNPV have similar short-term arterial switch operation outcomes, AR and neo-aortic root dilation occur more frequently and earlier compared with patients with tricuspid native pulmonary valve.

Open surgical strategies for access from opposing directions may be technically problematic. Recent advances in protective devices and coiling techniques have compelled the present study, aimed at technical aspects and procedural outcomes of coil embolization in this setting.  Methods:   Data prospectively accruing between May 2001 and May 2020 were systematically reviewed, assessing clinical and morphologic outcomes of coil embolization in 36 patients with 72 kissing aneurysms.  Results:   Lesions most often involved paraclinoid internal carotid artery (n = 22), followed by anterior communicating artery (n = 7). Single-stage coil embolization of both aneurysms took place in nearly all patients (n = 35). Microcatheter tips for selecting paired aneurysms were usually directed opposite to one another (32 of 36, 88.9%), applying protective devices (i.e., balloons or stents) to 1 or both aneurysms in 21 patients (58.3%). Balloons were placed in 9 patients, often when treating first aneurysms and largely for second aneurysms as well (7 of 9, 77.8%). Stents deployed in 14 patients involved first and second aneurysms equally. Two patients required balloon of stent combinations. No procedure-related morbidity or mortality resulted. In follow-up of 68 aneurysms (mean: 40.2 ± 28.1 months) after coiling, 86.8% (59 of 68) showed sustained complete saccular occlusion.  Conclusions:   Strategies for endovascular treatment of kissing aneurysms rely heavily on characteristics that the paired aneurysms display. Properly conducted single-stage coil embolization is a safe and effective method of treating such lesions.""","""['Hyun Sik Kim', 'Young Dae Cho', 'Dong Hyun Yoo', 'Noah Hong', 'Chang Hwan Pang', 'Kang Min Kim', 'Sung Ho Lee', 'Won-Sang Cho', 'Hyun-Seung Kang', 'Jeong Eun Kim', 'Moon Hee Han']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

The aim of surgical treatment for EOS is stopping the progression of the curvature, maintaining the correction, ensuring the maximum growth of the vertebrae, and ensuring that the vertebrae remain mobile. Using magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) in the treatment of EOS is intended to protect the patient from the negative effects of repetitive surgeries, increase patient compliance and satisfaction, and increase the speed of return to normal social life. Our aim was to report the early radiological evaluation findings and detect the changes in the quality of life of patients and their parents after the diagnosis of EOS and treatment with MCGRs.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective clinical study (level 4 case series) of 20 patients with a surgical indication for the treatment of EOS. The 20 patients had undergone treatment with MCGRs and lengthening procedures at 3-month intervals from August 2014 to August 2016. The mean patient age at surgery was 7.9 years (range, 4-10 years), and the mean length of follow-up was 14.9 months (range, 6-30 months). The preoperative, early postoperative, and final follow-up radiographs of all patients were obtained. The Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis, spinal height, thoracic height, sagittal balance, coronal balance, shoulder balance, and pelvic balance were measured from the radiographs. All the patients had undergone preoperative and final follow-up respiratory function tests, and all the patients completed the Early Onset Scoliosis 24-item questionnaire (EOSQ-24). The outcome measures were the Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis, spinal height, thoracic height, sagittal balance, coronal balance, shoulder balance, and pelvic balance. All the patients had undergone preoperative and final follow-up respiratory function tests, and the parents of every patient completed the Turkish version of the EOSQ-24.  Results:   The preoperative, early postoperative and final follow-up mean Cobb angles were 56.6° (range, 38°-93°), 30.5° (range, 13°-80°), and 33.5° (range, 14°-86°), respectively. These findings showed statistically significant improvement in the Cobb angle (P < 0.05). The thoracic height was also significantly increased. The preoperative, early postoperative, and final follow-up mean height was 181 mm (range, 123-224 mm), 200 mm (range, 164-245 mm), and 212 mm (range, 167-248 mm), respectively (P < 0.05). The measurements for spinal height had also increased significantly, with preoperative, early postoperative, and final follow-up values of 219 mm (range, 213-366 mm), 315 mm (range, 260-402 mm), and 338 mm (range, 261-406 mm), respectively (P < 0.05). The thoracic kyphosis measurement was 41° (range, 5°-65°) preoperatively, which had decreased significantly to 32.5° (range, 0°-53°) at the final follow-up (P < 0.05). Our measurements showed no statistically significant differences in the coronal and sagittal balance, pelvic balance, or shoulder balance. No significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative respiratory function test results. The assessment of the EOSQ-24 scores had demonstrated significant improvements in the mean scores at the final follow-up (P < 0.05). When different categories in the EOSQ-24 were evaluated separately, no statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and final follow-up scores for general health, pain and discomfort, respiratory function, movement capability, physical function, or effects on daily life (P > 0.05). However, the exhaustion and energy levels, emotional state, effect of the disease on the parents and patient, and parent satisfaction scores had increased significantly from the preoperative assessment to the final follow-up (P < 0.05). The financial effect had decreased significantly at the final follow-up compared with the preoperative values (P < 0.05). Four patients had developed complications requiring further treatment, and none of the patients had developed infection that required surgical intervention.  Conclusions:   Our study showed that insertion of a MCGR is a safe procedure for treatment of EOS to correct the deformity and improve function in daily life. This method reduces the need for repetitive surgery and the likelihood of complications associated with other treatments. Thus, treatment with MCGRs increases patient satisfaction and facilitates patient compliance.""","""['Ismet Oral', 'Yasin Sahin', 'Muhammed Mert', 'Ali Oner', 'Deniz Kargin', 'Akif Albayrak', 'Mehmet Bulent Balioglu', 'Mehmet Akif Kaygusuz']""","""[' Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Health Sciences University Baltalimani Bone Diseases Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 421 surgical procedures performed in 354 (262 pediatric and 159 adult) patients with MMD from April 1991 to March 2021 at our institute. In addition to clinical information, raw images of postoperative infarction were collected and categorized into subtypes by the location of the infarction.  Results:   Symptomatic and asymptomatic postoperative infarction occurred in 47 and 12 patients (11.1% and 2.6%), respectively, and more than half (51.7%) of these cases of postoperative infarction occurred immediately or the day after the surgery. Cortical infarction around the craniotomy site was the most frequent pattern observed (50/59, 84.8%), and some of these cases seemed to occur under local compression from epidural or subdural hematomas (15/50, 30.0%). Ipsilateral white matter infarctions located in the watershed area (9/59, 15.3%) and contralateral infarctions (3/59, 5.1%) were also observed. Four patients (1.0%) showed sudden occlusions of ipsilateral or contralateral large intracranial arteries immediately after surgery. Postoperative infarction caused permanent neurologic deficits in 7 patients (1.7%), and all included the cortex outside the craniotomy site.  Conclusions:   Local cortical irritation, hemodynamic fluctuation, and thromboembolic events were suggested as possible mechanisms of postoperative infarction after indirect revascularization in patients with MMD.

We evaluated the utility of intraoperative intravenous analgesia on postoperative pain and the postoperative course in patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 228 consecutive patients who underwent single-lobe thoracoscopic lobectomy for malignant pulmonary tumors between October 2017 and December 2019. Instead of epidural anesthesia, intercostal nerve blocks were performed from the thoracic cavity. We assessed the differences in the clinical and perioperative parameters including postoperative pain among the following: (1) N group (nonintraoperative intravenous analgesia), (2) A group (1000 mg acetaminophen), and (3) AF group (1000 mg acetaminophen with 50 mg flurbiprofen axetil). The numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain.  Results:   Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff pain score for the additional analgesic within 12 h postsurgery was 3.5 (area under the curve = 0.771; sensitivity = 63%; specificity = 19.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.703-0.839; p < 0.01). Less pain scores on the surgical day were related to the AF group (NRS; N, 3 ± 2.6; A, 3 ± 2.4; AF, 2 ± 1.9; p = 0.008, respectively). No pain or mild pain (NRS = 0-2) on the operative day was strongly associated with the AF group (N = 36.4%; A = 46.4%; AF = 70.5%; p = 0.005).

Override rates of such alerts are high; however, they can be mitigated by alert tailoring or workflow-interrupting display of severe alerts that need active user acceptance or overriding. Yet, the extent to which the displayed alert interferes with the prescribers' workflow showed inconclusive impact on alert acceptance.  Objectives:   We aimed to assess whether and how often prescriptions were changed as a potential result of interruptive alerts on different (contraindicated) prescription constellations with particularly high risks for adverse drug events (ADEs).  Methods:   We retrospectively collected data of all interruptive alerts issued between March 2016 and August 2020 in the local CDSS (AiDKlinik) at Heidelberg University Hospital. The alert battery consisted of 31 distinct alerts for contraindicated DDI with simvastatin, potentially inappropriate medication for patients > 65 years (PIM, N = 14 drugs and 36 drug combinations), and contraindicated drugs in hyperkalemia (N = 5) that could be accepted or overridden giving a reason in free-text form.  Results:   In 935 prescribing sessions of 500 274 total sessions, at least one interruptive alert was fired. Of all interruptive alerts, about half of the sessions were evaluable whereof in total 57.5% (269 of 468 sessions) were accepted while 42.5% were overridden. The acceptance rate of interruptive alerts differed significantly depending on the alert type (p <0.0001), reaching 85.7% for DDI alerts (N = 185), 65.3% for contraindicated drugs in hyperkalemia (N = 98), and 25.1% for PIM alerts (N = 185).

Here, we determined how today’s patients differ from the population reported in COSS.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed all patients that were referred to our Department for superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease following the publication of COSS.  Results:   Between 2012 and 2019, 179 patients were referred for 186 bypass surgeries. Ninety-one (51%) patients suffered atherosclerotic, unilateral internal carotid occlusion and 88 (49%) atherosclerotic multivessel disease. All patients had received intensive medical management. A single transitory ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within the last 120 days according to the inclusion criteria of COSS occurred in only 36 out of 179 (20%) patients, whereas 27 out of 179 (15%) suffered >1 transitory ischemic attack within 120 days, 109 out of 179 (61%) had recurrent minor ischemic stroke, and 7 out of 179 (4%) were hemodynamically unstable and required blood pressure maintenance. The distribution of symptoms did not differ between atherosclerotic unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and atherosclerotic multivessel disease (P=0.376) but hemodynamic impairment was significantly greater in atherosclerotic multivessel disease (P<0.001 for atherosclerotic multivessel disease versus atherosclerotic unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion).

Methods:   The retrospective interventional case series included 28 eyes (20 patients) that had IVR in combination or not with other treatment, for Stage 3 to 5 familial exudative vitreoretinopathy with active fibrovascular proliferation and prominent subretinal exudation. Outcome measures were fundus features after treatment, associated clinical variables, and genetic mutations.  Results:   The age of patients at the first IVR ranged from 0.2 to 36 months. An average of 1.3 IVR injections per eye were given. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy regressed in 16 (57%) eyes and progressed in 12 eyes (43%) after IVR. Laser and/or vitrectomy was performed on 13 eyes. The retina was reattached in 22 eyes (78%) after 24 to 58 months follow-up. Clinical variables associated with progression after IVR were preexisting fibrovascular proliferation over one quadrant and persistent vascular activity after the initial injection (P < 0.05). Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy-causative genetic mutations in 11 patients were related to variable response to IVR treatment.

Methods:   Minimally invasive endoscopic ICH evacuation was performed on patients with supratentorial ICH who fit prespecified clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic factors previously demonstrated to impact functional outcome in ICH were included in a univariate analysis to identify factors associated with favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) at 6 months.

Results:   Ninety patients underwent MIS endoscopic ICH evacuation within 72 hours of ictus. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with good long-term functional outcome included time to evacuation (per hour; OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.98], P=0.004), age (per decade, odds ratio [OR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.77], P=0.005), presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (OR, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.04-0.47], P=0.002), and lobar location (OR, 18.5 [95% CI, 4.5-103], P=0.0005).

Results:   Twelve female patients (age range, 56-88 years) with PCE and more than 5 years of follow-up (range, 5-13 years) were eventually included. All emboli were found in subsegment pulmonary arteries and were classified as peripheral PCE. Although 2 patients experienced transient symptoms after surgery, the majority of patients (84.6%) were asymptomatic during follow-up. No other reported emboli were observed during the follow-up period. The imaging data showed that the cement embolus could remain in the initial position throughout the long-term follow-up.

Although much research has focused on the concept of ""softening the landing"" to prevent proximal junction pathologies, long-segment constructs largely deviate from the force-deformation curve of the physiologic spine. Our novel distributed loading technique for ASD correction is described using multimaterial, long-segment constructs to create a biomechanically sound, yet physiologic, decremental stiffness toward the rostral end.  Methods:   Operative steps detail the custom-designed constructs of dual-headed pedicle screws and varied rod diameters and materials (cobalt chromium or titanium) for an initial 20 patients (mean 66.6 ± 4.8 years). Standing scoliosis films were obtained preoperatively and at regular intervals postoperatively to assess for PJK.  Results:   No patient had evidence of PJK or proximal junction failure at latest radiographic follow-up (mean 17.9 months, range 13-25 months). Radiographic findings for sagittal vertical axis averaged 11.2 ± 5.6 cm preoperatively and 3.6 ± 2.3 cm postoperatively. Compared with preoperative parameters, postoperative reductions in pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch averaged 28.7 ± 12.9 degrees, and sagittal vertical axis averaged 7.6 ± 5.2 cm while PJA was essentially unchanged.  Conclusions:   Preliminary results suggest that the distributed loading technique is promising for prevention of PJK with stiffness gradients that mimic the force-deformation curve of the physiologic posterior tension band. Our technique may optimize the degree of stress at the proximal junction without overwhelming the anterior column bony while remodeling and mature arthrodesis takes place.""","""['Zachary J Tempel', 'Randall J Hlubek', 'Michael C Kachmann', 'Alaina Body', 'David O Okonkwo', 'Adam S Kanter', 'Avery L Buchholz', 'Bryan M Krueger']""","""[' Mayfield Clinic, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

Chiari malformation is a relatively common pediatric neurosurgical pathology, and postoperative care varies widely. The postoperative course can be complicated by pain and nausea, which can extend the hospital stay. In this study, the authors aimed to examine whether instituting a standardized postoperative care protocol would decrease overall patient hospital length of stay (LOS) as well as cost to families and the hospital system.  Methods:   A retrospective study of pediatric patients who underwent an intradural Chiari decompression with expansile duraplasty at a single institution from January 2016 to September 2019 was performed. A standardized postoperative care protocol was instituted on May 17, 2018. Pre- and postprotocol groups were primarily analyzed for demographics, LOS, and the estimated financial expense of the hospital stay. Secondary analysis included readmissions, opioid consumption, and follow-up.  Results:   The analysis included 132 pediatric patients who underwent an intradural Chiari decompression with expansile duraplasty. The preprotocol group included 97 patients and the postprotocol group included 35 patients. Patient age ranged from 0.5 to 26 years (mean 9.5 years). The mean LOS preprotocol was 55.48 hours (range 25.90-127.77 hours), and the mean postprotocol LOS was 46.39 hours (range 27.58-77.38 hours). The comparison between means showed a statistically significant decrease following protocol initiation (95% CI 1.87-16.31 hours, p = 0.014). In the preprotocol group, 21 of 97 patients (22%) were discharged the first day after surgery compared with 14 of 35 patients (40%) in the postprotocol group (p = 0.045).

Methods:   Fifty-one naïve patients with HCC were included in the study. The tumors were classified according to the Edmondson-Steiner grade and separated as well-differentiated and non-well-differentiated (moderately and poorly differentiated). The ADC parameters of groups were compared by applying Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between tumors' histopathological stage and whole tumor ADC parameters was investigated using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (ROC) was applied to calculate the area under curve (AUC) with intersection point of ADC parameters and curve.  Results:   Mean and percentile ADC values of well-differentiated tumors were significantly higher than those of non-well-differentiated tumors (p < 0.05). The strongest correlation between histopathological grade and ADC parameters was 75th percentile ADC (r = - 0.501), 50th percentile ADC (r = - 0.476) and mean ADC (r = - 0.465). Mean, 75th and 50th percentile ADC values used for the distinction of groups gave the highest AUC at ROC analysis (0.781, 0.781, 0.767, respectively). When threshold values of mean, 75th and 50th percentile ADC values were applied (1516 mm2/s, 1194 mm2/s, and 1035 mm2/s) sensitivity was calculated as 0.73, 0.91, 0.83, respectively, and specificity was calculated as 0.82, 0.61, and 0.68, respectively.  Conclusions:   A correlation between whole tumor volumetric ADC values and HCCs' histopathological grade was detected in this study. 75th percentile, 50th percentile and mean ADC values are determined as highly sensitive and specific tests when the threshold values are applied for distinguishing between well-differentiated tumors and moderately/poorly differentiated tumors. When all these findings are evaluated together, HCCs' volumetric ADC values might be a useful noninvasive predictive parameters for histopathological grade in patients with HCC.""","""['Ferhat Can Piskin', 'Huseyin Tugsan Balli', 'Kivilcim Eren Erdoğan', 'Sinan Sozutok', 'Kairgeldy Aikimbaev']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Balcali Hospital, Cukurova University Medical School, Adana, Turkey. ferhatcpiskin@gmail.com.', ' Department of Radiology, Balcali Hospital, Cukurova University Medical School, Adana, Turkey.', ' Department of Pathology, Balcali Hospital, Cukurova University Medical School, Adana, Turkey.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Whole-lesion histogram analysis metrics of the apparent diffusion coefficient: a correlation study with histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma.', '3D analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient histograms in hepatocellular carcinoma: correlation with histological grade.', 'Correlations between the minimum and mean apparent diffusion coefficient values of hepatocellular carcinoma and tumor grade.', 'Evaluating histologic differentiation of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma using intravoxel incoherent motion and AFP levels alone and in combination.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for predicting histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma: Comparison with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'The Value of CT Perfusion Parameters and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Value of Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Weighted Imaging in Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Although the clinical effects are well described in GCA, the cost-effectiveness of the use of tocilizumab in GCA is ill defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab in GCA compared with prednisone alone.  Methods:   A retrospective study of 32 patients with biopsy-proven GCA comparing prednisone alone (16 patients) and prednisone with tocilizumab (16 patients) was performed. The cost for tocilizumab therapy for 26 weeks with mild and severe side effects (Groups 1 and 2, respectively) and for 52 weeks with mild and severe side effects (Group 3 and 4, respectively) was compared with estimated costs of mild and severe steroid-induced side effects (Groups 5 and 6, respectively). Statistical analysis between groups was conducted using independent sample t tests.  Results:   Three out of the 4 group combinations of tocilizumab with prednisone demonstrated a statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference in cost compared with prednisone alone for GCA. Group 2 (26-week tocilizumab therapy with severe steroid-induced side effects), with no statically significant difference in price when compared with steroid therapy alone and far fewer side effects, demonstrated the potential use of tocilizumab in GCA therapy. As expected, longer treatment duration with tocilizumab was associated with greater cost. With respect to side effect severity, the number of side effects of steroid therapy was inversely associated with difference in cost between tocilizumab therapy and steroid side effect treatment.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that combination therapy of tocilizumab and prednisone is significantly more expensive than steroids alone with or without accounting for the cost of steroid-induced side effects in treated GCA. The difference in cost between the 2 therapy types is directly related to tocilizumab therapy duration and inversely related to the number or severity of steroid side effects. Patients with GCA who require a shorter duration of steroid therapy and are at risk for a high number of side effects from steroid use may be potential candidates for tocilizumab therapy, from an economic perspective.""","""['Arjun V Jogimahanti', 'Ashwini T Kini', 'Lauren E Irwin', 'Andrew G Lee']""","""[' University of Texas Medical School at Houston (AVJ), Houston, Texas; Department of Ophthalmology (AK), Blanton Eye Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas; Houston Methodist Hospital (LI), Houston, Texas; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (AGL), University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas; Department of Ophthalmology (AGL), Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas; Departments of Ophthalmology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery (AGL), Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York; Section of Ophthalmology (AGL), University of Texas Maryland Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; and Department of Ophthalmology (AGL), the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""J Neuroophthalmol""","""['Treatment failure in giant cell arteritis.', 'Efficacy and tolerance of tocilizumab for corticosteroid sparing in giant cell arteritis and aortitis: Experience of Nimes University Hospital about eleven patients.', 'Tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis.', 'Trial of Tocilizumab in Giant-Cell Arteritis.', 'Current and emerging diagnosis tools and therapeutics for giant cell arteritis.']"""

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are reported to have high response rates and an accepted treatment option. We report the results of a phase 2 trial of an AI in recurrent/metastatic GCTs.  Methods:   41 patients with recurrent ER/PR + ve GCT received anastrozole 1 mg daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 12 weeks, evaluated by RECIST1.1 criteria. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), CBR duration, quality of life and toxicity.  Results:   The CBR at 12 weeks in 38 evaluable patients was 78.9%, which included one (2.6%; 95% CI: 0.5-13.5%) partial response and 76.3% stable disease. Two additional patients without measurable disease were stable, based on inhibin. Median PFS was 8.6 m (95% CI 5.5-13.5 m). There were delayed responses observed after 12 weeks with a total of 4 pts.

Conclusions:   This is the first prospective trial of hormonal therapy in GCTs. Although there was a high CBR, the objective response rate to anastrozole was much lower than the pooled response rates of >70% to AIs reported in most retrospective series and case reports.

Whether the intradural venous system is involved in drainage may lead to differences in clinical characteristics through specific pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the natural history and clinical outcomes of PVAVSs with or without intradural drainage.  Methods:   Sixty-four consecutive patients with PVAVSs from 2 institutes were retrospectively reviewed. Lesions were classified as type A (n=28) if the intradural veins were involved in drainage; otherwise, they were classified as type B (n=36). The clinical course from initial presentation to the last follow-up was analyzed.  Results:   The patients with type A shunts were older at presentation (52.5 versus 35.5 years, P<0.0001) and more likely to have lower spinal segments affected than patients with type B PVAVSs (67.8% versus 13.9%, P=0.00006). After presentation, the deterioration rates related to gait and sphincter dysfunction were significantly higher in patients with type A than type B shunts (gait dysfunction: 71.8%/y versus 17.0%/y, P=0.0006; sphincter dysfunction: 63.7%/y versus 11.3%/y, P=0.0002). According to the angiogram at the end of the latest treatment, 79% of type A and 75% of type B PVAVSs were completely obliterated. If the lesions were partially obliterated, a significantly higher clinical deterioration rate was observed in patients with type A shunts than those with type B shunts (69.9%/y versus 3.2%/y, P=0.0253).  Conclusions:   Type A PVAVSs feature rapid progressive neurological deficits; therefore, early clinical intervention is necessary. For complex lesions that cannot be completely obliterated, surgical disconnection of all refluxed radicular veins is suggested.""","""['Yueshan Feng#', 'Jiaxing Yu#', 'Jiankun Xu#', 'Chuan He', 'Lisong Bian', 'Guilin Li', 'Ming Ye', 'Peng Hu', 'Liyong Sun', 'Nan Jiang', 'Feng Ling', 'Tao Hong', 'Hongqi Zhang']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China (Y.F., J.Y., J.X., C.H., G.L., M.Y., P.H., L.S., N.J., F.L., T.H., H.Z.).', ' International Neuroscience Institute, Beijing, China (Y.F., J.Y., J.X., C.H., G.L., M.Y., P.H., L.S., N.J., F.L., T.H., H.Z.).', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Haidian Hospital, China (L.B.).']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Stroke""","""['The efficacy and deficiency of contemporary treatment for spinal cord arteriovenous shunts.', 'Clinical features and treatment outcomes of the spinal arteriovenous fistulas and malformation: clinical article.', 'Natural history of spinal cord arteriovenous shunts: an observational study.', 'Angio-architecture of spinal cord arteriovenous shunts at presentation.

The present single-center retrospective study aimed to investigate the effects of temperature and volume of intraoperative normal saline irrigation on postoperative pain and swelling and on serum markers of inflammation following elective, arthroscopic, single-bundle surgical reconstruction of the ACL. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical data from 716 patients with non-acute ACL injuries who met the criteria between March 2015 and May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were broken into 5 groups, depending on the volume or temperature of intraoperative irrigation with normal saline. At specific times after surgery, pain, knee swelling, and skin temperature were assessed. Postoperative levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-10 also were measured. RESULTS Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, rates of swelling, and skin temperature differed significantly among the 5 groups at all postoperative time points (P<0.001). The VAS scores(P=0.322) and ratings for swelling (P=0.245), and skin temperature (P=0.093) were not significantly different among the volume groups. There were no significant differences in the VAS scores (P=0.055), swelling ratings (P=0.570), or skin temperatures (P=0.321) among the groups that received irrigation with normal saline at different temperatures. There were no significant differences in postoperative serum levels of CRP, IL-1, IL-6, or IL-10 among the groups (P>0.05).

However, reports on one-session hybrid surgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are relatively rare. The safety and efficiency of combined treatment for brain AVMs were analyzed in biplanar hybrid operating room (OR) at one stage.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with AVMs undergoing combined surgical and endovascular treatment from October 2015 to June 2018. The data for resection rate, microcatheter adhesion, surgical position and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Total resection or near-total resection was achieved in all cases.  Results:   A total of 13 patients were under combined endovascular and surgical procedures, and 7 experienced surgery with intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. Sitting position was applied in 3 of them; 2 niduses in cerebellum, and 1 in parietal lobe. Compared with admission modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in all patients, postoperative 12-month mRS showed a significant decline. Besides, 3 patients experienced microcatheter adhesion after endovascular embolization, thereafter underwent surgical adhesion removal while nidus resection was done.  Conclusion:   Combined endovascular and surgical modality in a hybrid OR at one stage provides a safe strategy for the treatment of AVMs. The biplanar hybrid neurointerventional suite is endowed with unconstrained operating angle which enables combined endovascular and surgical treatment in sitting position. It also reduces the risk of microcatheter adhesion, which enables interventional radiologists to perform aggressively.""","""['Can Xin#', 'Wen-Ting Luo#', 'Wen-Yuan Zhao', 'Li-Xin Dong', 'Zhong-Wei Xiong', 'Zheng-Wei Li', 'Jian-Jian Zhang', 'Jin-Cao Chen']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', ' Department of Ultrasound, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. chenjincao2012@163.com.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Curr Med Sci""","""['Safety and outcome of combined endovascular and surgical management of low grade cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children compared to surgery alone.', 'Combined Endovascular and Microsurgical Treatment of Arteriovenous Malformations in the Hybrid Operating Room.', 'Curative treatment for low-grade arteriovenous malformations.', 'Transvenous embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations: a review of techniques, indications, and outcomes.', 'Surgical management of pediatric cerebral arteriovenous malformations.', 'Epidemiology and Management of Iatrogenic Vertebral Artery Injury Associated With Cervical Spine Surgery.']"""

Although CRKP is usually sensitive to tigecycline, monotherapy with this drug is often less than effective. We investigated the efficacy of a combined regimen of tigecycline with high-dose, extended-infusion meropenem in the treatment of donor-derived CRKP infection after kidney transplantation.  Methods:   From Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2017, a total of 12 CRKP isolates were detected from cultures of the organ preservation solution used for soaking the donor kidneys at our institute. Probable or possible donor-derived infection (DDI) was identified in 8 transplant recipients. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing CRKP was reported to be positive in organ preservation solution cultures at 3.5±0.9 days after transplantation, leading to surgical site (n=3), urinary tract (n=4), and/or bloodstream (n=2) infections in 8 recipients. The drug susceptibility tests showed that CRKP was sensitive to tigecycline, but resistant to meropenem. In 7 patients who received tigecycline combined with high-dose extended-infusion meropenem, DDIs were successfully cured. The length of hospital stay was 31 (18-129) days, and the serum creatinine at discharge was 105.8±16.7 µmol/L. The one remaining patient who received tigecycline combined with intravenous-drip meropenem died of septic shock. A median follow-up of 43 months (33-55) showed no recurrence of new CRKP infection in the 7 surviving recipients.  Conclusion:   It was suggested that a prompt and appropriate combination therapy using tigecycline with high-dose extended-infusion meropenem is effective in treating donor-derived KPC-2-producing CRKP infection after renal transplantation.""","""['Zhi-Qiang Wang', 'Zhi-Liang Guo', 'Hao Feng', 'Cheng Fu', 'Guang-Yuan Zhao', 'Ke Ma', 'Lan Zhu', 'Gang Chen']""","""[' Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', ' Department of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', ' Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. zhulan@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.', ' Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Wuhan, 430030, China. zhulan@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.', ' Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. gchen@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.', ' Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Wuhan, 430030, China. gchen@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Curr Med Sci""","""['Antagonistic effect between tigecycline and meropenem: successful management of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.', 'Outcomes of transplantation using organs from a donor infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae.', 'Molecular Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Bloodstream Infections in Wuhan, China.', 'Successful Treatment of Early Post-Transplant Bloodstream and Pulmonary Infection Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae With a Combination of Ceftazidime-Avibactam and Carbapenem: A Case Report.', 'Controlling infection and spread of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae among burn patients.', 'Risk Factors and Prognosis of Carbapenem-Resistant Organism Colonization and Infection in Acute Cholangitis.']"""

In this study, pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in retrospectively collected colorectal epithelial tumor tissues, including 441 CRCs [133 microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) and 308 microsatellite stable (MSS)] and 595 premalignant colorectal lesions (330 serrated lesions and 265 conventional adenomas). TRK-positive cases were then subjected to next-generation sequencing and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm NTRK rearrangements. TRK IHC positivity was not observed in any of the MSS CRCs, conventional adenomas, traditional serrated adenomas, or hyperplastic polyps, whereas TRK positivity was observed in 11 of 58 (19%) MLH1-methylated MSI-high CRCs, 4 of 23 (17%) sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia (SSLDs), and 5 of 132 (4%) sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). The 11 TRK-positive MSI-high CRCs commonly harbored CpG island methylator phenotype-high (CIMP-high), MLH1 methylation, BRAF/KRAS wild-type, and NTRK1 or NTRK3 fusion (TPM3-NTRK1, TPR-NTRK1, LMNA-NTRK1, SFPQ-NTRK1, ETV6-NTRK3, or EML4-NTRK3). Both NTRK1 or NTRK3 rearrangement and BRAF/KRAS wild-type were detected in all nine TRK-positive SSL(D)s, seven of which demonstrated MSS and/or CIMP-low. TRK expression was selectively observed in distorted serrated crypts within SSLs and was occasionally localized at the base of serrated crypts. NTRK fusions were detected only in SSLs of patients aged ≥50 years, whereas BRAF mutation was found in younger age-onset SSLs. In conclusion, NTRK-rearranged colorectal tumors develop exclusively through the serrated neoplasia pathway and can be initiated from non-dysplastic SSLs without BRAF/KRAS mutations prior to full occurrence of MSI-high/CIMP-high. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

What is wrong with the hypothesis?""","""Several studies have investigated the hypothesis of the efficacy of regional anesthesia (RA) techniques in preventing cancer recurrence when used perioperatively during oncological surgeries. Although theoretically, the association appears beneficial, the patient outcomes after cancer surgeries with or without RA were comparable, that is, the use of RA did not improve patient survival or prevent cancer recurrence after surgery. Another problem with this data is its retrospective nature which makes its interpretation difficult. Moreover, there are a lot of other confounding factors like comorbidities, tumor biology, nosocomial infections, duration of hospital stay, and baseline immunity, which is not comparable, and hence make standardization for a well-designed prospective study difficult. Return to intended oncologic therapy (RIOT) involves treatment in the form of radiation or chemotherapy which, if received on time after the planned oncosurgery, could provide a better chance of preventing cancer recurrence and improved survival. However, none of the retrospective studies have correlated cancer recurrence with delay in RIOT or not receiving RIOT as a cause of cancer recurrence. This paper discusses why even a well-designed, prospective trial could possibly never establish the efficacy of RA in preventing cancer recurrence and improving survival due to the complexities involved in a patient undergoing oncosurgery.""","""['Abhijit S Nair', 'Vibhavari Naik', 'Mohammed Salman Saifuddin', 'Harini Narayanan', 'Basanth Kumar Rayani']""","""[' Department of Anaesthesiology, Ibra Hospital, Ministry of Health-Oman, Ibra-414, Sultanate of Oman.', ' Department of Anaesthesiology, Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Indian J Cancer""","""['The perioperative period in cancer surgery: a critical moment!

RESULTS Bland-Altman analyses revealed that the average differences±standard deviation (SD) between XLT and DT tracking methods were 0.4±2.9 mm, 0.3±4.35 mm, and -1.8±6.8 mm for the SI, left-right (LR), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively. These results indicated high consistency in the SI and LR directions and poor consistency in the AP direction. Uncertainty differed significantly between XLT and DT (22.813±5.721% vs 9.384±3.799%; t=-5.236; P=0.0008), but we found no significant differences in dxAB, AvgStdErr, or MAXStdErr. CONCLUSIONS In the majority of cases, motion tracking by XLT and DT was consistent and synchronized in the SI directions, but not in the LR and AP directions. With a boundary margin of 0.3±4.35 mm and 1.8±6.8 mm for the LR and AP directions, DT may contribute to better implementation of CyberKnife Synchrony treatment in patients with lung tumors near the diaphragm that cannot be seen in tumor visualization tests.""","""['Guo-Quan Li', 'Jing Yang', 'Yan Wang', 'Mengjun Qiu', 'Zeyu Ding', 'Sheng Zhang', 'Sheng-Li Yang', 'Zhenjun Peng']""","""[' Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', ' Department of Oncology, Liyuan Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', ' Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', ' Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Pancreatic tumor motion on a single planning 4D-CT does not correlate with intrafraction tumor motion during treatment.', 'Correlation and prediction uncertainties in the cyberknife synchrony respiratory tracking system.', 'Target margin design for real-time lung tumor tracking stereotactic body radiation therapy using CyberKnife Xsight Lung Tracking System.', '4DCT and CBCT based PTV margin in Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy(SBRT) of non-small cell lung tumor adhered to chest wall or diaphragm.', 'Clinical log data analysis for assessing the accuracy of the CyberKnife fiducial-free lung tumor tracking system.']"""

These may be owing to the vertebral body bifurcating anteriorly and posteriorly when a load is applied and the filled cement being unstable. We report the usefulness of BKP combined with pediculoplasty using cannulated screws (vertebra-pediculoplasty) for OVF with a risk of cement dislodgement.  Methods:   Between April 2020 and February 2021, this surgery was performed on 10 patients with split-type and delayed-union OVF. The diagnosis was made using imaging findings on preoperative computed tomography or intraoperative images during balloon inflation. Early postoperative ambulatory rehabilitation was performed, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.  Results:   Early pain relief was obtained in all patients. The stability of the fractured vertebrae was demonstrated using both supine and seated radiographs from the early postoperative period, and good clinical results were obtained. The cement in this surgery was stabilized using a cannulated screw in the vertebral body, anteroposteriorly, and craniocaudally. The cement mass integrated with the cannulated screw was stabilized with the vertebral lamina and pedicle as a stopper.

We aimed to examine the impact of ATA15 in a high-volume Australian endocrine surgery unit.  Methods:   A retrospective study of all patients undergoing thyroidectomy from January 2010 to December 2019.  Inclusion criteria:   PTC histopathology, Bethesda V-VI, size 1-4 cm, and absence of clinical evidence of lymph node or distant metastases pre-operatively. Primary outcome was rate of HT before and after ATA15.  Results:   Of 5408 thyroidectomy patients, 339 (6.3%) met the inclusion criteria - 186 (54.9%) pre-ATA15 (2010-2015) and 153 (45.1%) post-ATA15 (2016-2019). The patient groups were similar; there were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, tumour size, proportion with Bethesda VI cytology, compressive symptoms, or thyrotoxicosis. Post-ATA15, there was a significant increase in HT rate from 5.4% to 19.6% (P = 0.0001). However, there was no corresponding increase in completion thyroidectomy (CT) rate (50.0% versus 27.6%, P = 0.2). The proportion managed with prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) fell from 80.5% to 10.8% (P < 0.0001). Pre-ATA15, the only factor significantly associated with HT was Bethesda V. In contrast, post-ATA15, HT was more likely in patients with younger age, smaller tumours, and Bethesda V.  Conclusion:   After the release of 2015 ATA guidelines, we observed a significant increase in HT rate and a significant decrease in pCND rate for low-risk PTCs in our specialised thyroid cancer unit.

The safety duration of temporary clipping was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the results were validated in clinical data.  Results:   Temporary clipping during operation (P < 0.05) and electrophysiological warning during operation (P < 0.05) were related risk factors of a cerebral ischemia event after operation. The ROC curve was drawn for the duration of temporary clipping and the occurrence of intraoperative electrophysiological warning, and the area under the curve was 0.78 (P < 0.05). The optimal cutoff value was 372.5 seconds, the sensitivity was 0.818, and the specificity was 0.762. After reviewing the clinical data, P < 0.05 was statistically significant after a χ2 test with 372.5 seconds equal to approximately 6 minutes.

However, nephrotoxicity limits its use. In this study, we looked for a possible protective effect of pantoprazole against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We used novel biomarkers for early detection of nephrotoxicity. Sixty chemotherapy naïve head and neck cancer patients completed the study. Following complete history taking and thorough clinical examination, patients were randomly divided into three groups: 20 patients in each. Group I (control group) received cisplatin without pantoprazole, groups II and III received pantoprazole 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, concurrently with cisplatin. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, and 48 h after the first and third cycles of cisplatin administration. Assessment of serum creatinine and soluble FasL (sFasL), as well as urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was performed. Nephrotoxicity was detected in 6 patients in group I, none in group II and 3 patients in group III. Serum creatinine significantly increased at the end of treatment in group I compared to groups II and III. Group I also had significantly higher urinary KIM-1 and NGAL and serum sFasL compared to groups II and III after the first and third cycles. On the contrary, there was no significant difference between groups II and III. Pantoprazole prevented the increase in acute kidney injury biomarkers in cisplatin-treated patients.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study involving 16 tertiary care centers (8 in the United States, 8 in Europe) from March 2015 to December 2020. Patients who developed SM during EUS-GE for GOO were included. We propose classifying SM into 4 types. The primary outcome was rate and severity of SM (per American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy lexicon), whereas secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes and management of dislodgement according to the SM classification type, in addition to salvage management of GOO after SM.  Results:   From 467 EUS-GEs performed for GOO during the study period, SM occurred in 46 patients (9.85%). Most SMs (73.2%) occurred during the first 13 EUS-GE cases by the performing operators.

Type I SM was more frequently rated as mild compared with type II SM (75.9% vs 42.9%, P = .04) despite an equivalent rate of surgical repair (10.3% vs 7.1%, P = .7). Overall, 4 patients (8.7%) required an intensive care unit stay (median, 2.5 days). The median length of stay was 4 days after SM.

Since then, hydrosurgery has been widely used for osmidrosis. However, we have experienced that some complications often occur in patients treated with hydrosurgery.  Objective:   We hypothesized that using a hydrosurgery could lead to excessive resection of the tightly attached apocrine glands and thus more complications. We aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and associated complications of the hydrosurgery method for osmidrosis were compared with those of conventional methods with two parallel incisions.  Methods & materials:   We retrospectively analyzed 31 and 16 patients who underwent conventional and hydrosurgery methods, respectively, for osmidrosis from 2010 to 2020. Two parallel long incisions were identical in both groups. Early complications (hematoma, seroma, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, revision, scar contracture), late complications (scar, pigmentation, comedones/milia, and sebaceous cysts), and effectiveness (subjective satisfaction, malodor elimination, reduced hair growth, and sweating elimination) were evaluated.  Results:   Skin necrosis was significantly more frequent in the hydrosurgery group than in the conventional group (p = 0.036). No other significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of other complications and effectiveness. As a result of comparing effectiveness, subjective satisfaction (p = 0.306), malodor elimination (p = 1.000), reduced hair growth (p=1.000), and sweating elimination (p = 0.742) did not show any significant difference between the two groups.  Conclusion:   Osmidrosis treatment with the use of VERSAJET™ Hydrosurgery System yielded similar and satisfactory results as the conventional subdermal excision method.

There are many nipple reconstruction methods that use a local flap, but reduced post-operative nipple projection is a common problem. Here, we report a modified tattooing method (3D-E tattoo) that enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), including Montgomery glands, after flap-based nipple reconstruction.  Methods:   The subjects were 110 consecutive patients who underwent nipple reconstruction using the C-V flap technique between April 2017 and June 2019. Of these patients, 49 received traditional medical tattooing (Group T) and 61 underwent 3D-E tattoo (Group 3D). A 10-point subjective evaluation of the 3D appearance of the reconstructed NAC was performed, and the scores were compared between the groups.  Results:   The procedure time for 3D-E tattoo was about 5 minutes longer than that for traditional tattooing. The average score in Group 3D of 7.8/10 was significantly higher than that of 6.4/10 in Group T.  Conclusion:   Application of 3D techniques or ""realism"" in tattoo artistry has significant potential to improve the esthetic outcomes of reconstructive surgery.

Methods:   This was a retrospective single-center study of 51 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma (MPM). The tumors were classified into pure epithelioid type and those with sarcomatoid component (pure sarcomatoid and biphasic type). Imaging features of these subtypes were compared for extent and type of peritoneal thickening, omental thickening, abdominal visceral infiltration, abdominal wall infiltration, and loco-regional and distant metastases. Fisher's Exact test was used to correlate the association of imaging features with histology types followed by multivariate analysis using logistic regression test.  Results:   32 males and 19 females with a median age of 63 years (range 35-86 years) were included in the study. 41/51 (80%) were epithelioid histology type and 10/51 (20%) had sarcomatoid component (3 pure sarcomatoid type, 7 biphasic type). Abdominal visceral infiltration was seen more commonly in cases of MPM with sarcomatoid component (p = 0.001). Sarcomatoid type also had a frequent association with metastases (p = 0.001) and discrete masses (p = 0.01). Epithelioid type was commonly associated with ascites (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, most significant correlation was identified between the sarcomatoid type and imaging features of metastases (p = 0.001) and visceral infiltration (p = 0.019).

However, only a few studies have explored the effectiveness and safety of the PRA for aortocaval and infrarenal PGL resection.  Methods:   We designed this retrospective study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the PRA for aortocaval and infrarenal PGL resection in a single center. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent PRA for PGL resection at our medical center from January 2006 to March 2021. Eight patients were enrolled, of whom six had aortocaval PGL. We investigated the surgical outcomes of enrolled patients.  Results:   The locations of the tumors in relation to the renal vein were: suprarenal in two (25.0%) patients, at the renal vein level in three (37.5%) patients, and infrarenal in three (37.5%) patients. The mean operative time of the enrolled patients was 101.5 ± 39.1 min. The mean postoperative stay was 3.5 ± 1.5 days, and the estimated blood loss was 31.3 ± 51.4 ml. There was one minor complication (chyle leakage), and two hypotensive events occurred during the surgery. Focusing on the results of the renal vein level and infrarenal PGL resection, the mean operative time, mean postoperative stay, and estimated blood loss of the patients were 109.2 ± 41.3 min, 3.5 ± 1.8 days, and 41.7 ± 56.4 ml, respectively.

Methods:   Clinical and pathological data were collected from 147 ICC patients who attended two tertiary centers over the past 5 years. The patients were classified into two groups: the LND group (group A) and the no-performance LND (NLND) group (group B). Clinical and pathological parameters were compared between the two groups to analyze the impact of LND on the long-term survival time of ICC patients.  Results:   Of the 147 patients, 54.4% (80) received LND and 42.5% (34/80) of these were found to have lymph node metastasis (LNM). LND did not increase postoperative complications (27.5%, P = 0.354), but postoperative hospital stays were longer (12.2 ± 6.3 d, P = 0.005) in group A compared with group B (20.9%, 9.5 ± 3.5 d). The 5-year survival rates of groups A and B are almost similar (21% vs 29%, P = 0.905). The overall survival rate of cN0 (diagnosis obtained by imaging) is better than pN1 (diagnosis obtained by histopathology), but lower than pN0 (all P < 0.05). Compared with NLND, the median survival time of LND patients with T1 has not significantly improved (29.3 vs 35.1 months, P = 0.762), but the patients with T2-4 has been significantly increased (29.0 vs 17.1 months, P = 0.040).

Anterior approach is beneficial for L5-S1 DA reconstruction and fusion. However, factors associated with a greater DA restoration in oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) at L5-S1 have not been studied.  Purpose:   This study aimed to identify factors that aid in achieving a greater DA in OLIF at L5-S1.  Study design/setting:   A retrospective analysis.  Patient sample:   This study involved 61 consecutive patients who underwent OLIF at L5-S1 for lumbar degenerative disease and were followed for more than 1 year. Patients with incomplete data or posterior column osteotomy at L5-S1 were excluded.  Outcome measures:   The L5-S1 DA was measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the last follow-up on standing lateral lumbar radiographs. The associations between demographics and/or surgical and/or radiological factors and the L5-S1 DA at the last follow-up were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.  Methods:   Demographics and surgical factors were reviewed from the medical records with respect to age, sex, body mass index, bone mineral density, diagnosis, surgery level, cage parameters (cage lordotic angle and height), laminectomy performed and/or not performed, estimated blood loss, operative time, configuration of the left common iliac vein. Radiological factors were measured with respect to sagittal parameters, the L5-S1 disc parameters, and the postoperative cage parameters.  Results:   The mean preoperative DA at L5-S1 was 5.4±5.0°, which increased to 18.9±5.6° postoperatively (p<.001) and was maintained as 16.5±5.9° at the last follow-up (p<.001). The preoperative DA, end plate lesions, anterior spur, facet joint osteoarthritis, or cage position at L5-S1 did not affect the DA at the last follow-up (all p>.05). Multiple regression analysis showed four independent variables, including increased age, increased cage lordotic angle, laminectomy performed, and absence of cage subsidence as the factors associated with the greater DA at L5-S1.  Conclusions:   OLIF at L5-S1 showed favorable DA restoration regardless of the preoperative conditions. To achieve a greater DA, surgeons should try to distract the anterior disc space for insertion of a larger lordotic cage. Laminectomy during posterior fixation is recommended for achieving additional DA restoration.""","""['Nam-Su Chung', 'Chang-Hoon Jeon', 'Han-Dong Lee', 'Hee-Woong Chung']""","""[' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea.

Methods:   15 MTSCCs were retrospectively evaluated by MR with T2-weighted image without fat suppression (n = 15) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), fat-suppressed T1-weighted GRE (n = 11). Size-matched ccRCC (n = 30) and pRCC (n = 30) were evaluated as control. T2 ratio was calculated as the signal intensity (SI) ratio of the lesion to the renal cortex on T2W images. Enhancement ratio (ER) was calculated as (SIpost - SIpre)/(SIpre), where SIpre (SIpost) is the SI of the entire lesion on each phase of DCE images. Early nodular enhancement was subjectively evaluated in MTSCC. T2 ratio and ER were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction.  Results:   The mean value of T2 ratio was highest in ccRCC (1.24), followed by MTSCC (1.02), and pRCC (0.84). Difference of T2 ratio was significant between ccRCC and pRCC (p < 0.001), but not between MTSCC and ccRCC (p = 0.4) or between MTSCC and pRCC (p = 0.2). The mean ER of MTSCC, ccRCC and pRCC were 1.33, 1.53 and 0.38 in corticomedullary phase (CMP), 1.60, 1.61 and 0.69 in nephrographic phase (NGP) and 1.79, 1.35 and 0.77 in excretory phase (EP), respectively.

Yet, they are rarely used in Wilson's disease.  Objective:   Evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ARFI, FIB-4, APRI, combined detection in cirrhosis with WD, and speculate the optimal high, low cutoff.  Methods:   This retrospective study was authorized by hospital ethics Committee (number:2021MCZQ02). 102 patients with WD completed ARFI and laboratory examination on the same day. The intraclass correlation coeffcient (ICC) of ARFI among three sonographers was 0.896 (95%CI:0.859-0.925, p = 0.000). The stage of liver involvement was classified into 5 categories according to clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, and liver morphologic characteristics: I, normal; II, biochemical abnormal only; III, abnormal liver morphologic features without sighs of cirrhosis; IV, clinical and imaging sighs of compensateded cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A); V, decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B and C). This stage system served as the reference standard. The diagnostic efficacy was analyzed by Logistic regression, ROC curve. The optimal low cut-off with high sensitivity (SE) and low negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and high cut-off with high specificity (SP) and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) were derived.  Results:   The diagnostic value of ARFI (0.85, 95%CI:0.77-0.92, p = 0.000) in distiguishing cirrhosis with WD was higher than FIB-4 (0.59, 95%CI: 0.47-0.70, p = 0.127), APRI (0.70, 95%CI: 0.59-0.81, p = 0.000). The low, high cut-off of ARFI for excluding, diagnosing cirrhosis with WD was 1.47 m/s(SE: 98%, NLR:0.09), 2.11 m/s(SP:98%, PLR:27.4), 37 (36%) patients could be spared a liver biopsy. When ARFI was 1.47∼2.11 m/s, liver biopsy was recommended. After combined with ARFI, the AUROC of FIB-4, APRI were increased respectively (p < 0.001), there were not different between ARFI and combined detection(p > 0.05).

A scoring system (0-2) was used to evaluate the degree of abnormality observed in visual analysis (bulging, abnormal vascularity, T2 dark band, placental heterogeneity). The axial, coronal, and sagittal planes were manually segmented separately to obtain texture features, and seven combinations were obtained: axial; coronal; sagittal; axial and coronal; axial and sagittal; coronal and sagittal; and axial, coronal, and sagittal. Feature selection using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method and model construction using a support vector machine algorithm with k-fold cross-validation were performed.

The fusion point between the upper eyelid orbital septum and the levator aponeurosis or the tarsal plate plays an important role in determining the width of the natural double eyelid. We observed a number of unsatisfactory upper eyelid blepharoplasty outcomes resulting from improper handling of the orbital septum-such as excessive destruction of orbital septum tissue and failure to form a firm attachment point between the orbital septum and the levator aponeurosis or palpebrae plate-during primary surgery.  Objectives:   The three most common types of unsatisfactory upper blepharoplasty outcomes include abnormally high double eyelid creases, multiple creases, and disappearance of creases. In the repair operation, we try to determine the remaining orbital septum tissue for reconstruction and form a firm attachment between the orbital septum and the levator aponeurosis or tarsal plate. Follow-up after surgery was performed to observe whether our technique can ensure effective and favorable long-term natural-looking upper eyelid blepharoplasty outcome.  Methods:   From January 2018 to January 2020, secondary blepharoplasty involving the above-mentioned unsatisfactory double eyelid results was performed in 83 patients, including 63 patients (141 eyes) with abnormally high skin creases, 6 patients (8 eyes) with multiple creases, and 14 patients (24 eyes) with double eyelid disappearance. The outcomes were assessed 6 months to 2 years after the surgery by reviewing the photographs to evaluate the esthetic outcomes including stability of double eyelid, double fold curve, symmetry, patient satisfaction, and the incidence of complications.  Results:   After an average follow-up of 12 months, most patients achieved a better double eyelid appearance. The esthetic outcome was graded as good in 80 patients, poor due to recurrence of double eyelid disappearance in 2, and poor because of asymmetry of the double eyelid curve in length or width in 1 patient. All patients had acceptable scars. No cases of infection or ptosis were observed.  Conclusion:   Reconstructing the orbital septum and ensuring a firm fixation with the levator aponeurosis or tarsal plate is an effective method to repair unsatisfactory upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Moreover, it is very important to protect the orbital septum and proper treatment during the initial surgery.

Methods:   The authors conducted an 8-year retrospective analysis for 17 patients who were presented from January 2013 to January 2021. Clinical criteria, operative details, and follow-up data were assessed. Overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. An event was assigned with the occurrence of recurrence or metachronous disease, or death.  Results:   Median age at diagnosis was 14 years (range: 6-17.5 years). Ten patients (58.8%) were males and seven (41.2%) were females. Hypertension-related symptoms were the main presentations in 15 patients (88%). None of the included children underwent genetic testing. Sixteen patients (94%) had unilateral tumors (right side: 12), whereas only one was presented with bilateral masses. The median tumor size was 7 cm (range: 4-9 cm). Metastatic workup did not reveal any metastatic lesions. All patients underwent open adrenalectomy, and clinical manifestations were completely resolved after surgery. Adjuvant therapy was not administered to any patient. There were no deaths or relapses at a median follow-up time of 40 months, whilst two children had metachronous disease after primary resection. Both were managed by adrenal-sparing surgery, and they achieved a second complete remission thereafter. Five-year OS and EFS were 100% and 88%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Complete surgical resection achieves excellent clinical and survival outcomes for pheochromocytoma in children. Meticulous, long-term follow-up is imperative for early detection of metachronous disease to facilitate adrenal-sparing surgery. Genetic assessment for patients and their families is essential; however, it was not available at our institution.""","""['Alaa Younes', 'Ahmed Elgendy', 'Wael Zekri', 'Sayed Fadel', 'Habiba Elfandy', 'Marwa Romeih', 'Magda Azer', 'Gehad Ahmed']""","""["" Surgical Oncology Department, Children's Cancer Hospital 57357, Cairo, Egypt."", ' Surgical Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.

Methods:   Two experienced and two less-experienced radiologists retrospectively evaluated 99 MRE in CD patients (50 initial MRE, 49 follow-up MRE) performed from 1/1/2019 to 3/20/2020 for the presence of active bowel inflammation (stomach, proximal small bowel, ileum, colon), stricture, probable stricture, penetrating disease, and perianal disease. The MRE protocol did not include dedicated perianal sequences. Inter-rater agreement was determined for each imaging feature using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa and compared by experience level.  Results:   All readers had almost-perfect inter-reader agreement (κ > 0.90) for penetrating disease, abscess, and perianal abscess in all 99 CD patients. All readers had strong inter-reader agreement (κ: 0.80-0.90) in 99 CD patients for active ileum inflammation, proximal small bowel inflammation, and stricture.

This study aimed to explore and compare the efficacy of surgical levels (single level vs double level) of PDN in treating LDH. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients diagnosed with LDH from January 2012 to December 2014 in our hospital who underwent PDN were included in this study. Patients were divided into a single-level group and double-level group based on the number of discs/surgical treatment levels. The improvement of visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction, and reoperation occurrence were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Of 105 total patients, 75 patients were treated with single-level treatment and 30 patients with double-level treatment. VAS for leg pain and patient satisfaction scores in the double-level group were worse than those in the single-level group at 6 months after surgery (P<0.05). Among all 105 patients, the incidence of reoperation was 11.4%. Also, there was a marked difference in reoperation occurrence at 6 months after surgery between the single-level (6.7%) and double-level (23.3%) groups; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS PDN is a safe and minimal-invasive approach, which could effectively treat LDH. The number of surgical levels might be an important factor influencing the efficacy of PND.

As 13-fraction SRT lasts for at least 17 days, adaptive radiotherapy based on contrast-enhanced mid-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often necessary for patients undergoing 13-fraction SRT. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed interfractional target changes in patients with brain metastases treated with 13-fraction SRT.  Methods:   Our analyses included data from 23 patients and 27 metastatic brain lesions treated with 13-fraction SRT with dynamic conformal arc therapy. The peripheral dose prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) was 39-44.2 Gy in 13-fractions. The gross tumor volume (GTV) of the initial SRT plan (initial GTV), initial PTV, and modified GTV based on the mid-treatment MRI scan (mid-treatment GTV) were assessed.  Results:   The median initial GTV was 3.8 cm3 and the median time from SRT initiation to the mid-treatment MRI scan was 6 days. Compared to the initial GTV, the mid-treatment GTV increased by more than 20% in five lesions and decreased by more than 20% in five lesions. Interfractional GTV volume changes of more than 20% were not significantly associated with primary disease or the presence of cystic components/necrosis. The mid-treatment GTV did not overlap perfectly with the initial PTV in more than half of the lesions.  Conclusions:   Compared to the initial GTV, the mid-treatment GTV changed by more than 20% in almost one-third of lesions treated with 13-fraction SRT. As SRT usually generates a steep dose gradient as well as increasing the maximum dose of PTV compared to conventional radiotherapy, assessment of the volume and locational target changes and adaptive radiotherapy should be considered as the number of fractions increases.""","""['Megumi Uto', 'Kengo Ogura', 'Tomohiro Katagiri', 'Keiichi Takehana', 'Takashi Mizowaki']""","""[' Department of Radiation Oncology and Image-Applied Therapy, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Medical Center, Wakayama, Japan.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, Shizuoka City Shizuoka Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology and Image-Applied Therapy, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. mizo@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Single isocenter stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with multiple brain metastases: dosimetric comparison of VMAT and a dedicated DCAT planning tool.', 'Monte Carlo evaluation of tissue heterogeneities corrections in the treatment of head and neck cancer patients using stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'In Silico Trial of MR-Guided Midtreatment Adaptive Planning for Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Centrally Located Thoracic Tumors.', 'Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience.', 'Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases.', 'An Extremely Inhomogeneous Gross Tumor Dose is Suitable for Volumetric Modulated Arc-Based Radiosurgery with a 5-mm Leaf-Width Multileaf Collimator for Single Brain Metastasis.', 'An exploratory analysis of MR-guided fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases.', 'Correlation of Brain Metastasis Shrinking and Deviation During 10-Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Late Sequela: Suggesting Dose Ramification Between Tumor Eradication and Symptomatic Radionecrosis.', 'Interfractional change of tumor volume during fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy using gamma knife for brain metastases.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 262 patients with stage III-IVb MMHN treated from March 1986 to November 2018 at our cancer center.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 34.0 months (range 1-262 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) probabilities were 37.7%, 30.2%, and 20.3%, respectively. The 5-year OS rates for patients with stage III, stage IVA, and stage IVB MMHN were 67.0%, 24.1% and 8.3%, respectively (P < 0.001). A total of 246 (93.9%) patients received surgery, 149 (56.9%) patients received chemotherapy, and 69 (26.3%) patients received immunologic/targeted therapy. A total of 106 (40.5%) patients were treated with radiotherapy: 9 were treated with preoperative radiotherapy, 93 were treated with postoperative radiotherapy, and 4 were treated with radiotherapy alone. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, primary tumor site, T stage, and immunologic/targeted therapy were independent factors for OS (all P < 0.05). Irradiation technique, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors for DMFS (all P < 0.05). T stage, N stage, and surgery were independent prognostic factors for DFS (all P < 0.05). Distant metastasis was observed in 107 of 262 patients (40.8%), followed by local [74 (28.2%)] and regional [52 (19.8%)] recurrence.

Four MRI sequences, including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1C), T1, T2, and FLAIR, were collected for each patient. Then, 4 heterogeneous subregions, i.e. the region of entire abnormality (rEA), the regions of contrast-enhanced tumor (rCET), necrosis (rNec) and edema/non-contrast-enhanced tumor (rE/nCET), were manually drawn from the 4 MRI sequences. For each subregion, 50 radiomics features were extracted. The stratification performance of 4 heterogeneous subregions, as well as the performances of 4 MRI sequences, was evaluated both alone and in combination. Our results showed that rEA was superior in stratifying long-and short-term OS.

We introduced a new oral commissure lift procedure and investigated its effectiveness and complication rates.  Methods:   Patients who underwent oral commissure lift in the plastic surgery clinic between January 2010 and December 2017 were enrolled retrospectively. Pre-and postoperative photographs were evaluated to measure oral commissure angles and analyze surgical complications, including visible scarring, unnatural appearance, and asymmetry. Many patients underwent a oral commissure lift with a simultaneous facelift. To exclude potential bias, we compared angular changes between patients receiving both oral commissure lift and facelift, with those receiving only oral commissure lift. Moreover, oral commissure angles of patients only receiving facelift were also measured. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.  Results:   Oral commissure lift was performed in 51 patients. The mean ages and follow-up periods were 46.7 ± 11.9 years, and 25.2 ± 22.9 months, respectively. The preoperative mean angles of the right and left oral commissures measured - 3.1 ± 4.0° and - 3.4 ± 3.7°, respectively, and postoperative mean angles measured 3.6 ± 3.2° and 3.3 ± 3.5°, respectively. Postoperative changes in oral commissure angles were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The low complication rate included undercorrection in one patient, asymmetry in one patient, and visible scarring in three patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data of 343 GC patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2010 and December 2013. All patients were divided into 2 groups according to the status of PS. Their clinical and pathological features, nutritional indicators, and incidence of postoperative complications were compared and potential prognostic factors were analyzed using the propensity score matching analysis (PSM). RESULTS Seventy-four (21.6%) patients had PS. Patients with PS had worse survival outcomes than those without PS (χ²=21.369, P<0.001). Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that PS, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis (all P<0.05) were the independent predictors of overall survival (OS). Patients with PS had significantly higher lymph node metastasis in No. 3, 4sb, 4d, 6, 8a, 9, and 14v lymph nodes. Patients with PS had significantly lower preoperative BMI, more weight loss, and lower prealbumin than those without PS. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in postoperative complications, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Distal GC patients with PS have poor clinicopathological and nutritional status and poor prognosis. However, PS does not increase surgery-related morbidity and mortality.""","""['Xuguang Jiao', 'Yu Wang', 'Xiangyang Qu', 'Jianjun Qu', 'Xinbo Wang']""","""["" Department of Surgical Oncology, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland)."", "" Department of Information Network Management, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland)."", "" Department of Nephrology, Second People's Hospital of Weifang, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).""]""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Impact of pyloric stenosis on the prognosis after D2 radical resection for advanced distal gastric cancer.', 'Safety and prognostic impact of prophylactic laparoscopic superior mesenteric vein (No. 14v) lymph node dissection for lower-third gastric cancer: a propensity score-matched case-control study.', 'Perioperative outcomes and survival in elderly patients aged\u2009≥\u200975\xa0years undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer: an 18-year retrospective analysis in a single Western centre.', 'Comparison of short-term efficacy between robotic and 3D laparoscopic-assisted D2 radical distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.', 'Effect of complication grade on survival following curative gastrectomy for carcinoma.']"""

Postoperative results were evaluated among patients with gastric cancer who underwent PP-RY and standard RY anastomosis.  Methods:   The clinical data of patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) in our center from May 2019 to May 2020 were collected retrospectively. We compared the short-term results of patients in the PP-RY and RY groups using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM).  Results:   A total of 317 patients were selected, including those who received RY (n = 249) or PP-RY (n = 68) after LTG. After PSM, both groups had a sample size of 68. During the one-year follow-up period, the incidences of postoperative dumping syndrome (5.6%) and reflux esophagitis (14.8%) were significantly lower in the PP-RY group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.010, respectively). Weight loss (6.5 ± 2.0 kg) and albumin decrease (0.2 ± 0.1 g/dl) were significantly lower (P = 0.038 and P < 0.001, respectively), and the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was significantly higher in the PP-RY group (P = 0.009). In the QLQ-C30 scale, the degree of anorexia in the PP-RY group was significantly lower than that in the RY group (P＜0.05). In the QLQ-STO22 scale, chest and abdomen pain, dietary restriction, and anxiety were significantly lower in the PP-RY group (all P＜0.05).

Presence of rash, hypomagnesemia, hypopotassemia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia during treatment and treatment response, date of progression, date of last visit and death were recorded.  Results:   A total of 138 patients' data were available for analysis. Any grade of rash was detected in 57 (44.5%) of the patients. The incidence of rash was significantly higher in patients with objective response than in patients with disease progression (%56.8 vs %14.3, p < 0.001). Progression free survival was 7.06 months (4.98-9.15) in patients treated with cetuximab and chemotherapy as first line treatment. In the multivariate analysis; rash was significantly correlated with longer PFS (HR 2.136; 95% CI 1.067-4.278; p = 0.032).

The 2 adjacent substitutions, designated p.Ser252Trp (S252W) and p.Pro253Arg (P253R), account for more than 98% of cases. Previous research has identified elevated hearing difficulties and incidence of cleft palate in this population. However, the influence of FGFR2 genotype on the speech, language, and communicative participation of children with AS has yet to be examined.  Methods:   A retrospective case note analysis was completed for all patients with a genetically-confirmed Apert mutation who attended the Oxford Craniofacial Unit over a 43-year period (1978-2020). Medical records were analyzed for speech, language, hearing, and communication data in detail. The therapy outcome measures, based on the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health was used to classify patient's communicative participation.  Results:   The authors identified 55 AS patients with genetically-confirmed mutation of the FGFR2 gene. One patient with a S252F mutation was excluded. There were 31 patients with the S252W mutation (male = 14; female = 17), age range of last hearing assessment (1-18 years), 64% (18/28) of patients had a cleft palate (including bifid uvula), 15 patients had conductive hearing loss, 1 patient had mixed hearing loss, 18 had otitis media with effusion (4 of whom had a cleft palate); 88% (21/24) of patients had receptive language difficulties, 88% (22/25) of patients had expressive language difficulties, 96% (27/28) of patients had a speech sound disorder. There were 23 patients with the P253R mutation (male = 13; female = 10); age range of last hearing assessment (1-13 years), 35% (8/23) patients had a cleft palate (including bifid uvula), 14 patients had a conductive hearing loss, 17 had otitis media with effusion (2 of whom had a cleft palate). Results indicated that 85% (17/20) of patients had receptive language difficulties, 80% (16/20) had expressive language difficulties, 100% (21/21) had a speech sound disorder. The S252W mutation was significantly-associated with the presence of cleft palate (including bifid uvula) (P = 0.05).Data about the cumulative impact of all of these factors for communicative participation using the therapy outcome measures were available for 47 patients: (30 S252W; 17 P253R). Patients with a S252W mutation had significantly more severe difficulties with communicative participation when compared to individuals with a P253R mutation (P = 0.0005) Cochran-Armitage trend test.  Conclusions:   Speech, language, communicative participation, and hearing difficulties are pervasive in patients with AS. The severity and functional impact of these difficulties are magnified in patients with the S252W mutation.

Methods:   We analyzed the peripheral blood routine parameters and other clinical data of 145 patients with colorectal cancer who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy between January 2011 and February 2014. Pretreatment blood parameters of 145 patients were collected, and PLR, NLR, and LWR were calculated. The utility of PLR, NLR, and LWR in predicting treatment efficacy and patient survival was statistically evaluated using the chi-square test, log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves and logistic regression models, and Cox regression models.  Results:   Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the best cutoff values of PLR, NLR, and LWR were 154.31, 3.01, and 0.22, respectively. In univariate analysis, tumor location (P = 0.044), differentiation degree (P = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.020), and high PLR (P = 0.042) were significantly correlated with a lower overall response rate (ORR). In addition, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and high PLR were correlated with short OS (P < 0.01) and DFS (P < 0.01). Moreover, WBC count was correlated with a short OS. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor location (P = 0.013), differentiation degree (P = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.033) were independent predictors of ORR. In addition, lymph node metastasis independently predicted a shorter OS (P = 0.011). Lymph node metastasis (P = 0.013) and high PLR (P = 0.022) were independent prognostic factors for short DFS.

Materials and methods:   Contrast enhanced venous phase CT images of 163 patients with pathological diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 125), gastric lymphoma (n = 12) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = 26) were retrospectively analyzed. Pixel size adjustment, gray-level discretization and gray-level normalization procedures were applied as pre-processing steps. Region of interest (ROI) was determined from the axial slice that represented the largest lesion area and a total of 40 texture features were calculated for each patient. Texture features were compared between the tumor subtypes and between adenocarcinoma grades. Statistically significant texture features were combined into a single parameter by logistic regression analysis.

In the management of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, de-intensification of treatment has been attempted; however, no such attempt is performed in the management of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to identify a group of patients who can safely be treated by de-escalated treatment intensity.  Methods:   From the Asian international multi-institutional retrospective study involving 13 Japanese, one Thailand, and one Korean institutions based on 469 patients, squamous cell carcinoma (Scc), tumor reduction ratio ≥29%, tumor size before brachytherapy ≤4 cm, and total treatment time (TTT) <9 weeks were identified as factors having an influence on local control. Based on these findings, low-risk patients having these four factors were extracted, and treatment outcomes categorized in 10 Gy increment of CTVHR D90 were compared.  Results:   Among 469 patients, 162 patients (34.5%) met the criteria of low-risk group, and 63, 41, 43, and 15 patients were categorized in CTVHR D90 50-60 Gy, 60-70 Gy, 70-80 Gy, and >80 Gy, respectively. While 4-y progression-free survival ranged from 66 to 80%, 4-y local control was consistently over 90% in every dose group. Rectum and bladder D2cc and incidence of late adverse events decreased as CTVHR D90 decreased.  Conclusions:   The low-risk patients achieved favorable local control with CTVHR D90 <80 Gy.

Purpose:   To determine if prostate heterogeneity (1) correlates with clinical risk factors for prostate cancer and (2) associates with higher-grade tumor in systematic biopsy (SB), compared with MRI-directed target biopsy (MDTB), i.e., SB > MDTB, thus providing a rationale for combined biopsy.  Methods:   IRB-approved retrospective study included men who underwent mpMRI, SB, and MDTB between 2015 and 2017. Regions of interest were applied to the entire transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC), and early dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images on the midgland slice. Mean signal intensities and standard deviation (SD) of each zone were calculated. SD served as a measure of heterogeneity. Spearman's rank correlation analysis of clinical and imaging variables was performed. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine if any imaging variable associated with SB > MDTB.  Results:   93 patients were included. Significant correlations included age and TZ ADC heterogeneity (rho = 0.34, p = 0.013), PSA density, and mean TZ ADC (rho = - 0.29, p = 0.049). PZ T2WI heterogeneity correlated with PZ ADC heterogeneity (rho = 0.48, p < 0.001). PZ DCE heterogeneity correlated with TZ DCE heterogeneity (rho = 0.46, p < 0.001).

Methods:   Patients who underwent PVDO were retrospectively reviewed and included if a high resolution three-dimensional computed tomography scan was available 1-year post-distractor removal. Two craniofacial surgeons were blinded to individual subjects and presented with 3 still images of three-dimensional bone reconstructions and asked to rate the degree of step off: none, mild, moderate, or severe. The data were analyzed with multinomial logistic regressions and other appropriate statistics.  Results:   Forty-one patients met inclusion criteria. All patients had multisuture or bicoronal craniosynostosis. Multinomial logistic regression identified age at PVDO (Cox and Snell = 0.487, P < 0.001) as a predisposing factor and one potentially protective factor, height of osteotomy (Cox and Snell = 0.394, P = 0.004) in univariate models. Post-hoc pairwise Mann-Whitney U test revealed there was decreased step-off rating when comparing osteotomy below torcula (median 0, [IQR 0, 3]) and above torcula (median 3 [IQR 1, 4]; P = 0.036) as well as a decreased step-off when below inion (median 0 [IQR 0, 1]; P = 0.001) was compared to above the torcula.  Conclusions:   Older age at PVDO predict increased risk of developing an occipital step-off deformity after PVDO, while design of the occipital osteotomy below the inion is protective.

Both plans used the original planning target volume (PTV) margins. Additionally, the potential dosimetric benefits of MR-guidance were estimated, by creating IMRT MRL plans using smaller PTV margins.  Materials and methods:   20 PCa patients previously treated with conventional VMAT were considered. For each patient, two different IMRT MRL plans using the low-field MR-linac treatment planning system were created: one with original (orig.) PTV margins and the other with reduced (red.) PTV margins. Dose indices related to target coverage, as well as dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters for the target and organs at risk (OAR) were compared. Additionally, the estimated treatment delivery times and the number of monitor units (MU) of each plan were evaluated.  Results:   The dose distribution in the high dose region and the target volume DVH parameters (D98%, D50%, D2% and V95%) were similar for all three types of treatment plans, with deviations below 1% in most cases. Both IMRT MRL plans (orig. and red. PTV margins) showed similar homogeneity indices (HI), however worse values for the conformity index (CI) were also found when compared to VMAT. The IMRT MRL plans showed similar OAR sparing when the orig. PTV margins were used but a significantly better sparing was feasible when red. PTV margins were applied. Higher number of MU and longer predicted treatment delivery times were seen for both IMRT MRL plans.  Conclusions:   A comparable plan quality between VMAT and IMRT MRL plans was achieved, when applying the same PTV margin. However, online MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy allows for a reduction of PTV margins. With a red. PTV margin, better sparing of the surrounding tissues can be achieved, while maintaining adequate target coverage.

Therefore, the current study aimed to validate the efficacy of UEMR versus conventional EMR and cap-assisted EMR (EMRC) for SNADETs measuring ≤20 mm.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients with sporadic nonpolypoid SNADETs measuring ≤20 mm undergoing EMR, EMRC, or UEMR at Chiba University Hospital between May 2004 and October 2020 (EMR, 21 patients and 23 SNADETs; UEMR, 60 patients and 61 SNADETs; EMRC, 45 patients and 48 SNADETs). A weighted logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of RX/1 and piecemeal resection. The recurrence rate of lesions observed ≥12 months after resection was assessed.  Results:   Both UEMR and EMRC had a significantly higher R0 resection rate than EMR. UEMR had significantly lower multiple resection and postbleeding rates than EMR. Only 1 patient (2.1%) who underwent EMRC experienced intraoperative and postoperative perforation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical data from 333 patients with acute anterior STEMI were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical echocardiographic and angiographic data from patients with left ventricular remodeling (LVR) and those without LVR were compared. Factors that influenced risk were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the model. RESULTS After 6-month follow-up, 135 of the patients experienced LVR (LVR group), whereas 198 did not (non-LVR group). Results of multivariate analysis showed that the number of stenosed coronary vessels, left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) at admission, and cardiac troponin I 3 days after admission (3-d cTnI) were all factors predictive of LVR in patients with acute anterior STEMI (all P<0.05). The established prediction model was Y=-20.639+0.711×number of stenosed coronary vessels + 0.137×LVEDV-0.129×LVEF+0.026×TGF-ß at admission + 0.162×3-d cTnI. The estimated AUC of this model was 0.978 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.955-0.991), significantly superior to the single-factor numbers for stenosed coronary vessel of 0.650 (95% CI 0.597-0.702), LVEDV of 0.876 (95% CI 0.836-0.910), LVEF of 0.684 (95% CI 0.631-0.734), TGF-ß at admission of 0.696 (95% CI 0.644-0.745), cTnI at admission of 0.913 (95% CI 0.877-0.941), and 3-d cTnI of 0.945 (95% CI 0.914-0.967).

However, the conventional imaging methods have certain deficiencies in the evaluation and prediction of the efficacy of nCRT. This study aimed to explore the value of functional imaging in predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).  Methods:   Fifty-four patients diagnosed with locally advanced ESCC from August 2017 to September 2019 and treated with nCRT were retrospectively analyzed. DW-MRI scanning was performed before nCRT, at 10-15 fractions of radiotherapy, and 4-6 weeks after the completion of nCRT. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed before nCRT and 4-6 weeks after the completion of nCRT. These 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters and relative changes were compared between patients with pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR.  Results:   A total of 8 of 54 patients (14.8%) were evaluated as disease progression in the preoperative assessment. The remaining forty-six patients underwent operations, and the pathological assessments of the surgical resection specimens demonstrated pathological complete response (pCR) in 10 patients (21.7%) and complete response of primary tumor (pCR-T) in 16 patients (34.8%). The change of metabolic tumor volume (∆MTV) and change of total lesion glycolysis (∆TLG) were significantly different between patients with pCR and non-pCR. The SUVmax-Tpost, MTV-Tpost, and TLG-Tpost of esophageal tumors in 18F-FDG PET/CT scans after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and the ∆ SUVmax-T and ∆MTV-T were significantly different between pCR-T versus non-pCR-T patients. The esophageal tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) increased after nCRT; the ADCduring, ADCpost and ∆ADCduring were significantly different between pCR-T and non-pCR-T groups. ROC analyses showed that the model that combined ADCduring with TLG-Tpost had the highest AUC (0.914) for pCR-T prediction, with 90.0% and 86.4% sensitivity and specificity, respectively.  Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for re-staging after nCRT and for surgical decision.

Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) assessment is crucial for treating advanced cervical cancer, to define irradiation fields. Objective of this study was to develop a score predicting para-aortic lymph node involvement in patients with advanced cervical cancer.  Patients and method:   We performed a multicenter, retrospective, study on 9 French centers from 2000 to 2015, including patients with advanced squamous cell cervix carcinoma who had PALN status assessed by imaging and/or by surgery. Factors associated with a risk of PALN involvement were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model. A score was then developed and validated.  Results:   A total of 1446 patients treated for cervical cancer were included. Of these, 498 had an advanced squamous cell cervical cancer. Ninety-one patients (18.3%) had positive PALN. After univariate and multivariate analysis, tumor size on pelvic MRI, initial SCC, and suspected pelvic node involvement on PET-CT were included in our score. This model allowed the population to be divided into 3 risk groups. Area under the ROC curve of the score was 0.81 (95%CI = 0.72-0.90). In the low-risk group, 9% (28/287) had PALN involvement, whereas in the high-risk group, 43% (22/51) had PALN involvement.  Conclusion:   We developed a simple score predicting PALN involvement in advanced cervical cancers. Three risk groups can be defined, and patients considered to be at low risk may avoid para-aortic staging as well as extensive field irradiation.""","""['H T Nguyen-Xuan', 'L Benoit', 'Y Dabi', 'C Touboul', 'E Raimond', 'M Ballester', 'S Bendifallah', 'P Collinet', 'Y Kerbage', 'L Ouldamer', 'A Bricou', 'V Lavoue', 'X Carcopino', 'C Huchon']""","""[' Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Intercommunal Hospital Centre of Poissy-Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 78300, Poissy, France; Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, France.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 192 patients with clinical stage IA SqCC who underwent complete resection with lobectomy and LN dissection at our institution between 2003 and 2019. To evaluate the incidence of LN metastasis from the perspective of indications for segmentectomy, we classified them into outer and inner groups based on the location of the tumor in the radiological findings.  Results:   Regarding tumor location, 123 patients had tumors in the outer location and 69 patients had tumors in the inner location. The incidence of LN metastasis was 6% in clinical stage IA SqCC, which included 6% in the outer location and 7% in the inner location (p = 0.669). In the outer location, all LN metastases were in N1 (6%); whereas in the inner location, the incidence of N1 and N2 metastasis were 6% and 1%, respectively.

We assessed the frequency of neglect and language impairment, rate of their rescue by MT, and impact of rescue on clinical outcomes.  Methods:   This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database from a comprehensive stroke center. We assessed right (RHS) and left hemispheric strokes (LHS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion undergoing MT to assess the impact of neglect and language impairment on clinical outcomes, respectively. Safety and efficacy outcomes were compared between patients with and without rescue of neglect or language impairment.  Results:   Among 324 RHS and 210 LHS patients, 71% of patients presented with neglect whereas 93% of patients had language impairment, respectively. Mean age was 71±15, 56% were females, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (12–20). At 24 hours, MT resulted in rescue of neglect in 31% of RHS and rescue of language impairment in 23% of LHS patients, respectively. RHS patients with rescue of neglect (56% versus 34%, P<0.001) and LHS patients with rescue of language impairment (64 % versus 25%, P<0.01) were observed to have a higher rate of functional independence compared to patients without rescue. After adjusting for confounders including 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, rescue of neglect among RHS patients was associated with functional independence (P=0.01) and lower mortality (P=0.01). Similarly, rescue of language impairment among LHS patients was associated with functional independence (P=0.02) and lower mortality (P=0.001).  Conclusions:   Majority of LHS-anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and of RHS-anterior circulation large vessel occlusion patients present with the impairment of language and neglect, respectively. In comparison to 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, rescue of these deficits by MT is an independent and a better predictor of functional independence and lower mortality.""","""['Shashvat M Desai', 'Konark Malhotra', 'Guru Ramaiah', 'Daniel A Tonetti', 'Waqas Haq', 'Tudor G Jovin', 'Ashutosh P Jadhav']""","""[' Departments of Neurology (S.M.D., G.R., W.H., A.P.J.), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA.', ' Department of Neurology, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA (K.M.).', ' Neurosurgery (D.A.T., A.P.J.), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA.', ' Department of Neurology, Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ (T.G.J.).']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""Stroke""","""['Laterality is an Independent Predictor of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients With Low National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.', 'Mechanical Thrombectomy for Minor and Mild Stroke Patients Harboring Large Vessel Occlusion in the Anterior Circulation: A Multicenter Cohort Study.', 'Mechanical thrombectomy in basilar artery occlusion: influence of reperfusion on clinical outcome and impact of the first-line strategy (ADAPT vs stent retriever).', 'Thrombectomy Technique Predicts Outcome in Posterior Circulation Stroke-Insights from the STAR Collaboration.', 'Stent-Retriever Thrombectomy and Rescue Treatment of M1 Occlusions Due to Underlying Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis: Cohort Analysis and Review of the Literature.']"""

By using a comprehensive marker set, here we looked for potential replication activities in GCs, and investigated whether these have diagnostic or clinical relevance in giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). GC rich regions of 10 primary and 10 first recurrence GCTB cases were tested using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays. The nuclear positivity rate of the general proliferation marker, replication licensing, G1/S-phase, S/G2/M-phase, mitosis promoter, and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor reactions was analyzed in GCs. Concerning Ki67, moderate SP6 reaction was seen in many GC nuclei, while B56 and Mib1 positivity was rare, but the latter could be linked to more aggressive (p = 0.012) phenotype. Regular MCM6 reaction, as opposed to uncommon MCM2, suggested an initial DNA unwinding. Early replication course in GCs was also supported by widely detecting CDK4 and cyclin E, for the first time, and confirming cyclin D1 upregulation. However, post-G1-phase markers CDK2, cyclin A, geminin, topoisomerase-2a, aurora kinase A, and phospho-histone H3 were rare or missing. These were likely silenced by upregulated CDK inhibitors p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p27KIP1, p53 through its effector p21WAF1 and possibly cyclin G1, consistent with the prevention of DNA replication. In conclusion, the upregulation of known and several novel cell cycle progression markers detected here clearly verify early replication activities in GCs, which are controlled by cell cycle arresting CDK inhibitors at G1 phase, and support the functional maturation of GCs in GCTB.""","""['Mate E Maros', 'Peter Balla', 'Tamas Micsik', 'Zoltan Sapi', 'Miklos Szendroi', 'Holger Wenz', 'Christoph Groden', 'Ramses G Forsyth', 'Piero Picci', 'Tibor Krenacs']""","""[' 1 Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ' Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Center for Preventive Medicine and Digital Health, Mannheim, Germany.', ' Department of Neuroradiology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', ' Department of Orthopedics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ' Department of Anatomic Pathology and Experimental Pathology, University Ziekenhuis, Brussels, Belgium.', ' Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['In situ cell cycle analysis in giant cell tumor of bone reveals patients with elevated risk of reduced progression-free survival.', 'Immunohistochemical analyses of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 expression in giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB): a possible role of Wnt pathway in GCTB tumorigenesis.', 'Multifaceted regulation of cell cycle progression by estrogen: regulation of Cdk inhibitors and Cdc25A independent of cyclin D1-Cdk4 function.', 'Estrogen-induced activation of Cdk4 and Cdk2 during G1-S phase progression is accompanied by increased cyclin D1 expression and decreased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor association with cyclin E-Cdk2.', 'Expression patterns of cyclins D1, E and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) in urothelial carcinoma: correlation with other cell-cycle-related proteins (Rb, p53, Ki-67 and PCNA) and clinicopathological features.', 'Cell Biology of Giant Cell Tumour of Bone: Crosstalk between m/wt Nucleosome H3.3, Telomeres and Osteoclastogenesis.', 'The Regulatory Network of Sturgeon Chondroitin Sulfate on Colorectal Cancer Inhibition by Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis.']"""

The incidence of Gleason score (GS) upgrading, extraprostatic extension (EPE), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) were evaluated in patients with clinical GG1. In pathological GG1 cases, the distribution of adverse pathological features including EPE, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was analyzed. Results: Altogether, 78 (24.2%) out of 322 men in the clinical GG1 group demonstrated upgrading of GS, including 19 men with pathological Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 and 6 with ≥ pathological Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 cases. EPE was found in 37 (11.5%) and 22 (8.9%) men in clinical GG1 and pathological GG1 group, respectively. The incidence of LVI and PNI in the pathological GG1 cases was 2.8% (n = 7) and 28.6% (n = 71), respectively. BCR was observed in 4 men in pathological GG1 T2 (n = 226) and 2 men in GG1 T3 (n = 22) group. When we compared the pathological features between pathological GG1 T3 vs. GG2 T2, there was no statistical differences in the incidence of LVI and PNI between the two groups.

In six of the nine patients due to the primary refractory disease we used rituximab plus cisplatine, cytosine-arabinoside, prednisolone salvage treatment and five of these patients responded well enough to become eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. One young male patient was refractory for various treatments and died due to the progression of his lymphoma.

The iCCA cases with CUL4A overexpression had significantly higher prevalence of intact activated autophagy (42.4 vs. 15.2%; p = 0.003), which was significantly associated with advance tumor stage (34.1% vs. 15.4%; p = 0.032), less extensive necrosis (8.3 vs. 49.3%; p < 0.001), and shortened disease-free survival (mean, 19.6 vs. 65.5 months, p = 0.015). In vitro, iCCA cells with CUL4A overexpression significantly increased LC3II level as compared to the cells under basal condition. Although both cell types showed intact autophagy with increased LC3II expression after bafilomycin A1 treatment, the accumulation of LC3II was higher in CUL4A-overexpressing cells. CUL4A overexpression increased the proliferation of cells as compared with control cells. After treatment with bafilomycin A1, proliferation was inhibited in both cell types, but the effects were more prominent in the cells overexpressing CUL4A. CUL4A promotes autophagy, and exhibits significantly higher autophagic flux which affects the proliferation of iCCA cells; these effects correlated with advance tumor stage and poor prognosis.

Its histopathological discrimination from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH) could be challenging. Thus, an immunohistochemical panel is mandatory for better discrimination. BAP1 is a newly identified diagnostic marker whose loss is specific to malignant mesothelioma. EZH2 overexpression is reported in different cancers, but its relation to BAP1 in malignant mesothelioma has not been fully understood. Survivin expression is said to be significantly higher in EM than in non-neoplastic pleural tissue, but its diagnostic utility as an immunohistochemical marker has not been thoroughly investigated in this field. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the combined use of these three nuclear markers (BAP1, EZH2 and Survivin) in discriminating pleural EM from RMH. Methods: This retrospective study includes two groups: 81 cases of pleural EM and 67 cases of RMH, retrieved from the archives of Pathology Department of Ain Shams University Hospitals and Ain-Shams University Specialized Hospital during the period from January 2016 to December 2019. An immunohistochemical study was performed using BAP1, EZH2 and Survivin antibodies. Results: There were highly statistically significant relations between study groups as regards the studied markers (p = 0.001 for each). The specificity was 100% for all combinations of immunohistochemical markers. Sensitivity of any combination of the immunohistochemical markers used in this study was found to be higher than the sensitivity of any of these markers used individually. The combination of all three markers showed the highest diagnostic accuracy (95.9%) and the highest sensitivity (92.6%). However, the combination of Survivin and EZH2 yielded the same diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity. Conclusion: Adding EZH2, Survivin and BAP1 to the diagnostic IHC panel for differentiating pleural EM and RMH could enhance diagnostic sensitivity.

Methods: A total of 67 patients with pathologically confirmed early-stage G3EEC diagnosed between 1997 and 2020 were identified; none received adjuvant chemotherapy. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a log-rank test. The protein expressions of ARID1A, p53, and MMR were examined via immunohistochemistry, and the associations between these biomarkers and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results: Recurrence was observed in 9 (13%) of the 67 patients with early stage G3EEC. The respective 5-years RFS and OS rates were 87.7% and 93.7%, and 68.6% and 85.7%, respectively for stages I and II. Multivariate analysis showed significantly longer RFS among patients with ARID1A loss (hazard ratio = 8.7; 95% CI, 1.09-69.6, p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in RFS and OS of patients according to p53 and MMR expression status.

Results: There were 57.5% (130/226) glioma cases having SCG3 cytoplasmic staining in the tissue microarray. SCG3 expression inversely correlated with malignancy grade at both transcriptional and protein levels. The highest level was observed in oligodendroglial tumors, especially in oligodendrogliomas (ODs) with IDH-mutation/1p19q-codeletion. The lowest SCG3 expression was observed in glioblastomas (GBMs), especially in the mesenchymal subtype. Nearly a half of GBM cases (44.4%, 64/144) had any discernible SCG3 staining, and were defined as SCG3-positive by the microarray study. SCG3-positive GBM cases exhibited improved overall survival as compared with the SCG3-negative cases (29.3 vs. 14.5 months; Hazard ratio, 0.364; 95% CI, 0.216-0.612; p < 0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis also revealed SCG3 positivity as an independent favorable prognosticator in GBM patients. Conclusion: SCG3 protein expression inversely correlates with glioma malignancy and predicts favorable outcomes in GBM patients.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Nan Ji', 'Junmei Wang', 'Jingli Cao', 'Deling Li', 'Yang Zhang', 'Liwei Zhang']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery/China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', ' Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing, China.', ' Department of Pathology, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', ' Beijing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine for Cerebrovascular Disease, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', ' Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Beijing, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Systematically characterize the clinical and biological significances of 1p19q genes in 1p/19q non-codeletion glioma.', 'A nuclear transport-related gene signature combined with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion better predicts the prognosis of glioma patients.', 'MXRA5 Is a Novel Immune-Related Biomarker That Predicts Poor Prognosis in Glioma.', 'Histomolecular classification of adult diffuse gliomas: the diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers.', 'Impending Impact of Molecular Pathology on Classifying Adult Diffuse Gliomas.', 'Recognition of a Novel Gene Signature for Human Glioblastoma.', 'Comparative ligandomics implicates secretogranin III as a disease-restricted angiogenic factor in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization.']"""

Even though its pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated, several studies suggested a role for transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) in the onset and progression of the disease. Consequently, the aim of this study was to analyze the concentrations of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, MMP-3, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in patients with different stages of DR in order to identify stage-specific changes in their concentrations during the progression of the disease. Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples were collected during intraocular surgery, and eyes were classified into the following groups: healthy controls (n = 17), diabetic patients with non-apparent DR (n = 23), mild/moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR) (n = 13), and advanced NPDR/proliferative DR (PDR) without vitreal hemorrhage (n = 14). None of the patients had been under anti-VEGF or laser treatment within six months prior to surgery. In the AH, TGF-β1 levels increased in advanced NPDR/PDR by a factor of 5.5 compared to the control group. Similarly, an increase in MMP-3 and TIMP-1 levels in the AH was evident in the later stages of DR, corresponding to a 7.7- and 2.4-fold increase compared to the control group, respectively, whereas serum levels of the studied proteins remained similar. In conclusion, increased concentrations of TGF-β1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 in the AH, but not in the serum, in advanced NPDR/PDR indicate that the intraocular regulation for these cytokines is independent of the systemic one and suggest their involvement in the progression of DR.""","""['Lucia Saucedo', 'Isabel B Pfister', 'Souska Zandi', 'Christin Gerhardt', 'Justus G Garweg']""","""[' Swiss Eye Institute, Rotkreuz and Retina Clinic, Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital, 3012, Switzerland.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, 3012, Switzerland.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""Mediators Inflamm""","""['Vitreous and aqueous concentrations of proangiogenic, antiangiogenic factors and other cytokines in diabetic retinopathy patients with macular edema: Implications for structural differences in macular profiles.', 'Higher TGF-β1, TGF-β2, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 Levels in the Aqueous Humor of Patients with Acute Primary Angle Closure.', 'Differential expression and localization of human tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.', 'Comparison of inflammatory cytokines levels in the aqueous humor with diabetic retinopathy.', 'Growth factor alterations in advanced diabetic retinopathy: a possible role of blood retina barrier breakdown.', 'Role of Decorin in the Lens and Ocular Diseases.', 'DNA methylation in diabetic retinopathy: pathogenetic role and potential therapeutic targets.', 'Role of Autotaxin in High Glucose-Induced Human ARPE-19 Cells.', 'Effects of the Calix4arene Derivative Compound OTX008 on High Glucose-Stimulated ARPE-19 Cells: Focus on Galectin-1/TGF-β/EMT Pathway.', 'TGFβ1 Induces Senescence and Attenuated VEGF Production in Retinal Pericytes.']"""

The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) is a well-known measurement tool to retrospectively assess parenting styles. Yet, no sufficiently validated German version exists to date. Therefore, we developed an updated translation of the German PBI version (PBI-dt) and analyzed its psychometric properties in an online survey based on a sample of n=791 German-speaking participants with a focus on item and reliability characteristics, construct and criterion validity as well as factorial structure of the PBI-dt.Our results indicated good item characteristics and reliability (α=0.86-0.95). Correlations between PBI and CTQ-SF (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form) scales were in line with the literature. Significant differences in the reported parenting style were found between people with and without mental illness as well as between normal-weight and overweight people. These results indicated the presence of good construct and criterion validity. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated an acceptable model fit for all fit indices in the original 2-factor model of Parker et al.

Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been advocated in these patients(1,2), but remains controversial.  Method:   All consecutive patients (1997-2017) with cervical cancer FIGO (2009) stage IB1 (≤4 cm) were included. Primary aim was to analyze the recurrence rate. Secondary aim was to identify the risk factors for disease recurrence and survival.  Results:   One-hundred-and-eighty-two patients were included in this retrospective study. Median follow-up was 13 years (range 8-17). Postoperatively, 21 patients received adjuvant therapy due to presence of positive lymph nodes, positive section margins or if a simple hysterectomy was performed (RT: n = 7, concomitant chemo radiotherapy (CCRT): n = 14). None of the patients with a combination of intermediate risk factors according to Sedlis (excluding patients >4 cm) underwent adjuvant RT/CCRT. Disease recurrence was observed in 19 patients (10%). Eleven patients died of disease. LVSI influenced progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 3.950, p = 0.0163) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR 4.637, p = 0.0497) significantly. However, the combination of LVSI, tumor size and DSI according to Sedlis did not influence overall survival (OS), DSS or PFS.  Conclusion:   Recurrence rate was low (10%), despite the fact that patients with intermediate risk factors according to Sedlis did not receive postoperative RT/CCRT.

As next-generation sequencing (NGS) is entering clinical practice, we evaluated whether more comprehensive immunomolecular profiling (CIMP), including NGS and extended immunohistochemical analysis, could further refine the current ProMisE classification.  Methods:   A series of 120 consecutive ECs, classified according to ProMisE, was stained immunohistochemically for CD3, CD8, PD-L1, beta-catenin and L1CAM. An in-house 96 gene NGS panel was performed on a subset of 44 ECs, representing the 4 ProMisE subgroups (DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit exonuclease domain mutated (POLEmut), mismatch repair deficient (MMRd), p53 abnormal (p53 abn) and no specific molecular profile (NSMP) ECs). Cases harboring non-hotspot POLE variants were analyzed with Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 NGS panel (TSO500) as a surrogate for whole-exome sequencing.  Results:   Eight cases harbored POLE variants, half of which were hotspots. Using TSO500, non-hotspot POLE variants were classified as pathogenic (3) or variant of unknown significance (1). POLEmut and MMRd ECs typically showed higher numbers of CD3+/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and higher PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. p53 abn ECs showed significantly higher L1CAM immunoreactivity and frequently harbored gene amplifications including HER2 (25%), but typically lacked ARID1A or PTEN variants. Beta-catenin-positivity and FGFR2 variants were predominantly found in NSMP ECs.  Conclusions:   Our data show that CIMP adds significant value to EC characterization and may help to determine pathogenicity of non-hotspot POLE variants, encountered more frequently than expected in our series. In addition, CIMP may reveal ECs benefitting from immune checkpoint inhibition and allows upfront identification of targetable alterations, such as HER2 amplification in p53 abn ECs.""","""['Jasper Victoor', 'Sara Vander Borght', 'Lien Spans', 'Stefan Lehnert', 'Hilde Brems', 'Annouschka Laenen', 'Ignace Vergote', 'Toon Van Gorp', 'Els Van Nieuwenhuysen', 'Sileny Han', 'Stefan Timmerman', 'Anne-Sophie Van Rompuy', 'Isabelle Vanden Bempt']""","""[' Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ' Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ' Department of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ' KU Leuven, Biostatistics and Statistical Bioinformatics Centre, Leuven, Belgium.', ' Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Division of Gynecological Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ' Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Translational Cell & Tissue Research, Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

Purpose:   To evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of CT for diagnosing acute cholecystitis (AC) when used as a first line imaging study for evaluating abdominal pain and assess if additional imaging with ultrasound studies provides additional clinically useful information.  Materials and methods:   Abnormal gallbladder findings in CT imaging studies were queried in a retrospective study over a 25-month period within a large urban health system. Sonographic (US) studies performed within 72 h of the initial CT were also included. Outcomes were determined by surgical pathology, fluid analysis, and clinical outcomes. Cases were stratified by the interpreting radiologist's subjective confidence level of diagnosing AC, and the PPVs were compared between cases using CT without US and cases with both CT and US.  Results:   Of the 468 CT studies meeting criteria, 192 were read as concerning for AC. PPV of CT was 44.7% without US and 50.5% when US was positive, which amounted to an insignificant gain (p = 0.41). When subdividing by confidence level, high-confidence positive CTs demonstrated no significant difference without ultrasound (80%) compared to with ultrasound (75%). Less confident reads in CT demonstrated potential gain from ultrasound; in the case of a ""probable"" CT impression, PPV increased from 45% without US to 90% with a high-confidence ultrasound impression.

We aimed to determine whether time-to-maximum of tissue residue function (Tmax) maps, derived from CT perfusion, can be used as a triage screening tool to accurately and rapidly identify patients with DMVOs.  Methods:   Consecutive code stroke patients who underwent multimodal CT were screened retrospectively. Two experienced readers evaluated all patients’ Tmax maps in consensus for presence of delay in an arterial territory (territorial Tmax delay). The diagnostic accuracy of this surrogate for identifying DMVOs was determined using receiver-operating characteristic analysis. CTA, interpreted by 2 experienced neuroradiologists with access to all imaging data, served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance of 4 other readers with different levels of experience for identifying DMVOs on Tmax versus CTA was also assessed. These readers independently assessed patients’ Tmax maps and CTAs in 2 separate timed sessions, and areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were compared using the DeLong algorithm. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to comparatively assess diagnostic speed.  Results:   Three hundred seventy-three code stroke patients (median age, 70 years; 56% male, 70 with a DMVO) were included. Territorial Tmax delay had a sensitivity of 100% (CI95, 94.9%–100%) and specificity of 87.8% (CI95, 83.6%–91.3%) for presence of a DMVO, yielding an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of 0.939 (CI95, 0.920–0.957). All 4 readers achieved sensitivity >95% and specificity >84% for detecting DMVOs using Tmax maps, with diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves) and speed that were significantly (P<0.001) higher than on CTA.  Conclusions:   Territorial Tmax delay had perfect sensitivity and high specificity for a DMVO.

We sought to determine inter-reader agreement of the Visualization Score which is currently unknown.  Methods:   Consecutive 6998 ultrasound HCC screening and surveillance studies in 3115 patients from 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively retrieved. Of these, 6154 (87.9%) studies were Visualization A (No or minimal limitations), 709 (10.1%) were Visualization B (Moderate limitations), and 135 (1.9%) were Visualization C (Severe limitations). Randomly sampled 90 studies, with 30 studies in each Visualization category, were included for analysis. Nine radiologists (3 senior attendings, 3 junior attendings and 3 body imaging fellows) blinded to the original categorization independently reviewed each study and assigned a Visualization Score. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to quantify inter-reader agreement.  Results:   ICC among all 9 radiologists was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63-0.77). ICCs among senior attendings, junior attendings and body imaging fellows were 0.68 (CI 0.58-0.76), 0.72 (CI 0.62-0.80) and 0.76 (CI 0.68-0.83), respectively. Subgroup analysis by liver parenchyma was further performed. ICC was highest in the patient group with normal liver parenchyma (0.69, CI 0.56-0.81), followed by steatosis (0.66, CI 0.54-0.79) and cirrhosis (0.58, CI 0.43-0.73), respectively.

Images were reviewed independently by two abdominal radiologists with 12 and 16 years of experience in two sessions 4 weeks apart, blinded to clinical data. Initially, only blended reconstructions (simulating conventional single-energy CT images) were reviewed (CT). Subsequently, CT and DECT reconstructions including low-keV virtual monoenergetic images and iodine maps were reviewed. Gallbladder fossa hyperemia, pericholecystic fluid, subjective presence of gangrene, heterogeneous wall enhancement, sloughed membranes, intramural air, abscess, overall impression of the presence of acute cholecystitis, and intramural iodine density were assessed.  Results:   Gallbladder fossa hyperemia was detected with increased sensitivity on DECT (R1, 61.4%; R2, 75.4%) vs. CT (R1, 22.8%; R2, 15.8%). DECT showed increased sensitivity for gangrene (R1, 24.6%; R2, 38.6%) vs. CT (R1, 5.3%; R2, 14%), heterogeneous wall enhancement (DECT: R1, 33.3%; R2, 63.2% vs. CT: R1, 7%; R2, 31.6%), and cholecystitis (DECT: R1, 86%; R2, 89.5% vs. CT: R1, 77.2%; R2, 70.2%).

Objective:   The objective of this study was to examine the difference in health care costs, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and cesarean birth rates for inpatient versus outpatient Foley induction protocols.  Material and methods:   We conducted a retrospective study using deliveries from 2013 to 2015 that received an outpatient or inpatient Foley catheter induction. Inductions were matched by race, parity, and maternal age. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to test the association between type of induction, length of stay, and cost. Maternal and neonatal factors and cesarean rates were also considered.  Results:   A total of 163 outpatient Foley inductions were matched 1:1 to inpatient inductions. Outpatient inductions were more likely to have a shorter length of hospitalization from admission to discharge (a 7.17-hour difference, 95% CI, 71.00, 77.59) and lower costs of hospitalization ($408 per patient, 95% CI, 4305, 4714). In the univariate analysis, there was no difference in rate of cesarean birth (OR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.61, 1.48). However, in the multivariate analysis, there was a decreased rate of cesarean for outpatient inductions (OR 0.5, 95% CI, 0.26, 0.97).

We demonstrated that ZEB2, the transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was upregulated in ascites cells from HGSOC patients and in CD133+ cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB2 in EOC cells decreased the percentage of CSLCs and reduced the colony forming potential, cell invasion capacity and expression of pluripotent genes Oct4 and Nanog. Inhibition of ZEB2 also induced cellular apoptosis and impacted the tumorigenicity of ovarian CSLCs. The mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were downregulated, while the epithelial marker E-cadherin was upregulated after ZEB2 knockdown. MiR-200a, a molecule that downregulates ZEB2, had the opposite effect of ZEB2 expression in EOC-CSLCs. A retrospective study of 98 HGSOC patients on the relationship of ascites volume, pelvic and abdominal metastasis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and the malignant involvement of abdominal organs and lymph nodes was performed. Patients with high expression of ZEB2 in tumour tissues had a higher metastasis rate and a poorer prognosis than those with low expression. The parameters of ZEB2 expression and ascites volume were strongly linked with the prognostic outcome of HGSOC patients and had higher hazard ratios. These findings illustrated that ZEB2 facilitates the invasive metastasis of EOC-CSLCs and can predict peritoneal metastasis and a poor prognosis in HGSOC patients.""","""['Yiying Li#', 'He Fei#', 'Qiwang Lin#', 'Fan Liang', 'Yanan You', 'Ming Li', 'Mengyao Wu', 'Ying Qu', 'Pengfei Li', 'Yan Yuan', 'Tong Chen', 'Hua Jiang']""","""[' Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200011, China.', ' Department of Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', "" Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200240, China."", ' Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', ' Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China. chentong@fudan.edu.cn.', ' Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200011, China. jianghua@fudan.edu.cn.', ' Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine Related Diseases, Shanghai, 200011, China. jianghua@fudan.edu.cn.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Oncogene""","""['FOXM1 expression is significantly associated with chemotherapy resistance and adverse prognosis in non-serous epithelial ovarian cancer patients.', 'Title Prognosis Significance of ZEB2 and TGF-β1 as well as Other Clinical Characteristics in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'A critical role of Oct4A in mediating metastasis and disease-free survival in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.', 'Fascin1 expression in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma is a prognostic marker and knockdown of fascin1 suppresses the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.', 'HMGA2 and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA HOTTIP induces inflammation in asthma by promoting EFNA3 transcription by CCCTC-binding factor.', 'Single-cell transcriptome reveals cellular hierarchies and guides p-EMT-targeted trial in skull base chordoma.', 'Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 2 as a Prognostic Biomarker in Various Cancers and Its Correlation with Infiltrating Immune Cells in Ovarian Cancer.', 'TRIM21 deficiency promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis via regulating p21 expression in ovarian cancer.', 'CircCRIM1 promotes ovarian cancer progression by working as ceRNAs of CRIM1 and targeting miR-383-5p/ZEB2 axis.']"""

Options of surgical treatment have a risk of intraoperative blood loss; therefore, uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been considered as an option of reducing intraoperative blood loss. However, UAE may be overused in clinical practice, especially in China. We present this protocol for a randomized clinical trial investigating the necessity of performing UAE for cesarean scar pregnancy, in combination with surgical suction curettage, taking into account the different subtypes of cesarean scar pregnancy. We recently developed a risk-scoring system (QRS) to estimate intraoperative blood loss, with 93.8% sensitivity and 6.3% false negative. Through this randomized clinical trial, we will retrospectively validate the QRS score on predicting intraoperative blood loss.  Methods and analysis:   We propose undertaking a randomized clinical trial sequentially recruiting 200 patients. All the patients will randomly receive ultrasound guided curettage with or without UAE. Data on the subtypes of cesarean scar pregnancy (Types 1 and II and III) detected by ultrasound will be collected before operation. The score on estimating intraoperative blood loss assessed by our recently developed quantitative risk-scoring system (QRS) will be collected before the operation. We will primarily compare the duration of the operation, intraoperative blood loss, and complications between the two groups. We will also retrospectively analyze the association of subtypes of cesarean scar pregnancy and the options of treatment and validate the QRS score.

However, little is known about the predictive value of SUA variability for postoperative CKD in patients with renal cell carcinoma after radical nephrectomy. We aimed to investigate the association of SUA variability with postoperative CKD in this population.  Method:   85 patients with preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled in this single-center retrospective study and followed up for at least 6 months. Intra-individual SUA variability was defined as the standard deviation (SD) of SUA and the patients were stratified into three groups according to the tertiles of SUA SD (the lower, middle and upper tertile). The association of SUA variability with postoperative CKD, defined as an eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2, was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   After a median follow-up time of 24(10-43) months, 44(51.7%) patients developed postoperative CKD. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients in the lower tertile had a longer CKD-free survival time [median CKD-free survival time 74(52.2-95.8) months] than those in the middle tertile [38(19.2-56.8) months] and upper tertile [21(17.9-24.1) months] (overall generalized Wilcoxon test: P=0.001; lower vs middle tertile: P=0.001; lower vs upper tertile: P<0.001). Adjusted Cox analyses indicated that increasing SUA SD tertiles were associated with a higher risk of postoperative CKD independent of baseline SUA, mean SUA during follow-up and other confounding variables. Compared with patients in the lower tertile, the risk for developing CKD increased by 4.6-fold for patients in the middle tertile and 7.9-fold in the upper tertile, respectively.

The objective of this study is to compare complications and recurrences between minimally invasive and open adjuvant hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer.  Methods:   Patients were identified who had undergone adjuvant hysterectomy following chemoradiation for 2009 FIGO stage IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancer from August 2006 to June 2018. Demographic information, treatment course, complications, recurrence data were retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Frequency of complications was compared with Fisher exact test or chi-square test as appropriate and inverse probability of treatment propensity score weighting was used to calculate the disease-free survival.  Results:   Fifty-four patients met inclusion criteria with a median follow up time of 60.4 months (interquartile range 28.0-98.1 months). There were 24 (44%) open versus 30 (56%) minimally invasive hysterectomies performed. The overall grade 2 or worse complication rate was 43%. There were 8 (27%) patients with complications in the minimally invasive group compared to 4 (17%) in the open group (OR 1.82 (95% CI 0.5-7.0)). There were 9 vaginal cuff defects, dehiscences and/or fistulas in the minimally invasive group compared to 3 in the open group (OR 3.0 (95% CI 0.8-11.2)). There was no statistically significant difference between disease free survival and overall survival among the two groups, however there was a trend towards decreased disease-free survival in the minimally invasive group.  Conclusions:   Among women undergoing adjuvant hysterectomy following chemoradiation for bulky, early stage cervical cancer, there was no difference in complication rates between an open or minimally invasive surgical approach. However, the overall complication rate was high, including a high rate of vaginal cuff defect, dehiscence and/or fistulas.

Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography has been performed to assess lymphatic functionality. We found that some BCRL patients had a difference in circumference in partial regions only. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patients with BCRL about the correlation between the difference in circumference and the findings of ICG lymphography.  Methods:   One hundred fifty-five patients with unilateral BCRL were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the differences in circumference taken at 4 parts on the upper limb (at around the wrist, forearm, elbow, and brachium). The difference in circumference was evaluated between the affected part (Caf) and the unaffected part (Cun). We calculated the circumference difference rate (CDR) as follows: CDR = 100 (Caf - Cun)/Caf. First, we classified each part of all BCRL patients (620 parts) based on the findings of ICG lymphography (linear, collateral, dermal back flow [DBF], and no enhancement) and evaluated the correlation. Second, in the patients with partial volume change, we compared the mean CDR in each part.  Results:   One hundred six parts were of a linear pattern, 31 parts were collateral, 350 parts were DBF, and 133 parts had no enhancement. The mean CDR of each finding was 3.3% in linear, 4.0% in collateral, 9.6% in DBF, and 9.4% in no enhancement. There was no significant difference between linear and collateral (P = 0.62), DBF, and no enhancement (P = 0.89) patterns. However, there was a significant difference between linear or collateral and DBF or no enhancement (all P < 0.001). In the 22 patients with distal DBF and proximal linear, the CDR was significantly higher in the forearm compared with the brachium (6.4% and 3.0%; P = 0.003). In the 26 patients with distal linear and proximal DBF, the CDR was significantly higher in the brachium compared with the forearm (4.3% and 7.7%; P = 0.005).

However, this surgery considerably impairs the performance of activities of daily living (ADL) due to the resulting stiffness. The lumbar stiffness disability index (LSDI) is a validated measure of the effect of lumbar stiffness on functional activity, but this index might not be fully applicable to the elderly Chinese population given several specific lifestyle characteristics.  Purpose:   To evaluate lumbar stiffness in patients with DLS after long-level fusion by Chinese-LSDI (C-LSDI).  Study design:   A retrospective study.  Patient sample:   A total of 129 DLS patients who underwent long-level (≧4 levels) fusion surgery with at least one-year follow-up from June 2009 to September 2017 were retrospectively included.  Outcome measures:   The C-LSDI was designed by modifying LSDI and Korean-LSDI (K-LSDI) based on elderly Chinese lifestyles and the internal consistency and retest repeatability of the patient-reported outcome questionnaire in the measurement of the impact of lumbar stiffness on functional abilities was assessed.  Methods:   The radiographic parameters including Cobb angle, apical vertebral translation (AVT), coronal vertical axis (CVA), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), lumbar lordosis (LL), and PI-LL, and clinical symptoms including visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and low extremity pain; Oswestry disability index (ODI), Japanese Orthopedic Association-29 (JOA-29), Scoliosis Research Society⁃22 (SRS-22), 36⁃Item short form survey (SF-36), physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) were measured preoperatively and at the last follow-up.  Results:   Compared with LSDI and K-LSDI, the C-LSDI demonstrated higher internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.902) and retest reliability (Internal consistency coefficients, ICC=0.904) in the elderly Chinese population. All patients showed increased lumbar stiffness and significant improvement in pain and deformity postoperatively. Regarding items, such as performing personal hygiene after toileting and getting out of a car, people reported more inconvenience with increasingly fixed levels.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that the C-LSDI questionnaire was a reliable and valid instrument for assessing functional limitations due to lumbar stiffness among elderly Chinese patients with DLS after long-level fusion. Although the effects of stiffness did trend toward greater impacts among patients who underwent longer fusions, most patients were satisfied with trade-offs of function and pain relief in exchange for perceived increases in lumbar stiffness.""","""['Xinling Zhang', 'Lei Yuan', 'Yan Zeng', 'Yinhao Liu', 'Zhongqiang Chen', 'Weishi Li']""","""[' Department of Orthopedics, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Spinal Disease Research, Beijing 100191, China.', ' Department of Orthopedics, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Spinal Disease Research, Beijing 100191, China.

Background:   Computed tomography (CT) might be a feasible tool for preprocedural planning of indirect mitral valve annuloplasty.  Methods:   In a retrospective analysis, 25 patients underwent Carillon device implantation and received CT-angiography (CTA) analysis prior to CS based percutaneous mitral valve repair. We used a retrospective approach with preprocedural CTA and intraprocedural coronary sinus angiography (CSA) measurements to determine the CS to Cx distance at the occlusion or compression point or in the distal landing zone in absence of Cx compromise.  Results:   According to left coronary artery angiography, we identified 7 patients with Cx occlusion, 7 with Cx compression and 11 without Cx compromise. No difference in minimal CS to Cx distance between the three groups could be obtained. Also, neither distal CS diameter nor distal Carillon anchor size were related to Cx impingement. However, ROC analysis identified a CS to Cx distance of <8.6 mm specifically in the distal device landing zone to predict Cx compromise. Furthermore, CTA was accurate in assessing device length in comparison to CSA, but failed predicting Carillon device anchor size.

Qualitative and quantitative assessment was performed on VUE images. Quantitative evaluation included measurement of attenuation and image noise for various tissues and the phantom. Virtual unenhanced image attenuation and noise were compared between scanner types, and intrapatient interscanner reproducibility of virtual unenhanced image attenuation was calculated as the percentage of measurement pairs with an interscanner difference ≤ 10 HU. Image quality, noise, sharpness, and iodine elimination were assessed qualitatively by 2 radiologists.  Results:   Significant interscanner differences in VUE attenuation and noise were found in all tissues. dlDECT and rsDECT showed significantly higher VUE attenuation than dsDECT in the aorta, portal vein, and kidneys (P < 0.05). Conversely, VUE attenuation in dsDECT was significantly higher than in dlDECT/rsDECT for subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat (both P < 0.05). A total of 91.9% (385/419) of measurements were reproducible between rsDECT and dlDECT, 70.9% (297/419) between dsDECT and rsDECT, and 66.8% (280/419) between dsDECT and dlDECT. Virtual unenhanced image attenuation in the contrast media-filled phantom cavity was 12.7 ± 4.7 HU in dlDECT, -5.3 ± 4.2 HU in rsDECT, and -4.0 ± 10.7 HU in dsDECT with significant differences between dlDECT and rsDECT/dsDECT, respectively (P < 0.05), between which attenuation was comparable in the unenhanced extraluminal phantom component (P = 0.11-0.62). Qualitatively, dsDECT yielded best iodine elimination, whereas sharpness, image noise, and overall image quality were rated higher in dlDECT and rsDECT.

Clinical features, histopathology, microbiology, and outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Eighteen patients were identified, and all were immunocompromised. Eight patients had colonization, while 10 had invasive disease (pneumonia [n = 3], skin and soft-tissue infections [n = 3], disseminated disease [n = 4]). Scedosporium apiospermum was identified in 15 patients, Lomentospora prolificans in 2 patients, and Scedosporium ellipsoideum in 1 patient.

Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the peripheral blood are known as two important inflammatory markers. In this study we evaluated and compared colorectal laparoscopy and laparotomy based on the PLR and NLR.  Methods:   Totally, 76 patients were divided into two groups including patients who underwent laparoscopy (45 cases) or laparotomy (31 cases). The PLR and NLR were calculated based on cell blood count analysis of preoperative and postoperative day (POD) one and three in both groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22.  Results:   The PLR and NLR have no significant association with age, gender and tumor site (p > 0.05). However, both ratios were significantly increased in laparotomy patients at POD1 compared with the laparoscopy patients (p < 0.05). According to the two by two comparisons, the preoperative and postoperative PLR were significantly different in the laparotomy group (p < 0.05) but not in the laparoscopy group (p > 0.05). However, the preoperative and postoperative NLR were significantly different in both laparoscopy and laparotomy groups (p < 0.05).

Methods:   A total of 100 patients receiving Limberg flap (LF) or Karydakis flap (KF) surgery at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were retrospectively analyzed, and the median follow-up period was 42 (range, 20-90) months. We performed a multivariate logistic analysis on the clinicopathological parameters and MRI data to identify risk factors for complications and recurrence.  Results:   The basic parameters of PS were obtained by MRI analysis. The multivariate analysis revealed a large longitudinal sinus diameter (OR = 1.020, 95%CI = 1.000-1.041) and sacrococcygeal dermal thickness (OR = 1.680, 95%CI = 1.142-2.472) to be independent risk factors for early complications. Meanwhile, a small sacrococcygeal fat thickness (OR = 0.923, 95%CI = 0.864-0.987) and a high BMI (OR = 1.291, 95%CI = 1.067-1.563) are independent risk factors for late complications and recurrence, respectively.

Anterior soft-tissue compression of spinal cord due to vertebral body hemangioma is challenging to manage. Our objective was to assess long-term clinical and radiologic effects of direct transpedicular absolute alcohol embolization, laminectomy, and short-segment instrumented fusion on resolution of extraosseous epidural soft tissue and improvement in myelopathy in cases of vertebral hemangioma causing anterior soft-tissue compression.  Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective analysis that included patients with single-level vertebral hemangioma with anterior intraspinal soft-tissue growth causing spinal cord compression and clinical features of myelopathy between June 2007 and June 2019 at authors' institute. Transpedicular vertebral body injection of absolute alcohol, laminectomy, and pedicle screw rod instrumentation was performed in all patients. Clinicoradiologic outcomes of surgery were noted. We proposed a grading system for the extent of anterior extraosseous epidural soft-tissue compression.  Results:   In total, 14 patients were included in study. Their mean age was 28.4 ± 14.4 years. Mean follow-up duration was 67.5 ± 36.2 months. All patients had preoperative radiologic grade 4 compression. Postoperative radiologic grading improved to grade 1 in 4 (28.6%), grade 2 in 8 (57.1%), and grade 3 in 2 (14.3%). All the patients improved neurologically after surgery. Eleven patients improved to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade E, 2 improved to ASIA D, and 1 improved to ASIA C at the last follow-up visit.  Conclusions:   Vertebral hemangiomas with anterior extraosseous epidural extension causing spinal canal compromise and myelopathy can be managed with direct transpedicular ethanol embolization, laminectomy, and short-segment instrumented fusion with resolution of the extraosseous soft tissue and improvement in myelopathy.

To identify the relevant characteristics to enable early detection, we retrospectively investigated endoscopic findings of gastric neoplasms in patients with FAP and then compared the clinical, histopathologic, and genetic features among subgroups.  Methods:   Of 234 patients with 171 pedigrees at 2 institutes, 56 cases (24%, 133 gastric neoplasms) with 44 pedigrees were examined. Immunostaining was performed for histopathologic evaluation by 1 blinded pathologist. According to the endoscopic findings, gastric neoplasms were divided into 4 types based on location (L: antrum and pylorus, UM: the rest of the stomach) and color (W: white, T: translucent, R: reddish) and their clinicopathologic features examined.  Results:   Of the cases, 93% could be classified into a single type. Among histologic phenotypes, high-grade dysplasia was present in 26% (type L), 41% (type UM-W), 0% (type UM-T), and 22% (type UM-R).

Methods:   Between 3/2005 and 12/2020, 104 patients with BTAI were brought to our hospital. The severity of each trauma case was evaluated using the Injury Severity Score (ISS); aortic injuries were classified as type I to IV according to Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. Initial treatment was categorized into four groups: nonoperative management (NOM), open aortic repair (OAR), TEVAR, or emergency room thoracotomy/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ERT/CPR).  Results:   The patients' mean age and ISS were 56.7 ± 20.9 years and 48.3 ± 20.4, respectively. Type III or IV aortic injury were diagnosed in 82 patients. The breakdown of initial treatments was as follows: NOM for 28 patients, OAR for four, TEVAR for 47, and ERT/CPR for 25. The overall early mortality rate was 32.7%. Logistic regression analysis confirmed ISS > 50 and shock on admission as risk factors for early mortality. The cumulative survival rate of all patients was 61.2% at 5 years after treatment. After initial treatment, eight patients receiving TEVAR required OAR. The cumulative rate of freedom from reintervention using TEVAR at 5 years was higher in approved devices than in custom-made devices (96.0 vs. 56.3%, p = 0.011).  Conclusions:   Using TEVAR as an initial treatment for patients with BTAI is a reasonable approach. Patients with severe multiple traumas and shock on admission had poor early outcomes, and those treated with custom-made devices required significant rates of reintervention.""","""['So Izumi', 'Chikashi Nakai', 'Tomonori Haraguchi', 'Soichiro Henmi', 'Takeki Mori', 'Megumi Kinoshita', 'Masato Yamaguchi', 'Koji Sugimoto', 'Shinichi Nakayama', 'Takuro Tsukube']""","""[' Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Japanese Red Cross Kobe Hospital and Hyogo Emergency Medical Center, 1-3-1 Wakihama-kaigandori, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 651-0073, Japan.', ' Department of Radiology, Japanese Red Cross Kobe Hospital and Hyogo Emergency Medical Center, Kobe, Japan.', ' Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', ' Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Hyogo Emergency Medical Center, Kobe, Japan.', ' Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Japanese Red Cross Kobe Hospital and Hyogo Emergency Medical Center, 1-3-1 Wakihama-kaigandori, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 651-0073, Japan. t-tsukube@kobe.jrc.or.jp.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg""","""['Nonoperative management of grade III blunt thoracic aortic injuries.', 'Delayed endovascular aortic repair is associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with blunt thoracic aortic injury.', 'Intraoperative heparin use is associated with reduced mortality without increasing hemorrhagic complications after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for blunt aortic injury.', 'Cardiac and Aortic Modifications After Endovascular Repair for Blunt Thoracic Aortic Injury: A Systematic Review.', 'Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) versus open surgery for blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury.', 'The clinical characteristics and surgical treatment for delayed blunt thoracic aortic injury-a case series.']"""

The current study was undertaken to categorize the breast lesions utilizing the newly proposed IAC Yokohama classification system and evaluate the risk of malignancy (ROM) for respective categories and the diagnostic yield of this technique.  Methods:   All FNAs of breast lesions over 2.5 years were categorized retrospectively using the newly proposed IAC Yokohama reporting system. The ROM was calculated along with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, diagnostic accuracy, false positive, and false-negative rate using the histological diagnosis as the gold standard.  Results:   The 512 cases were distributed as follows: Category I (insufficient material) 7.4%, Category II (benign) 74%, Category III (atypical) 5.7%, Category IV(suspicious) 1.4%, and Category V (malignant) 11.5%.

Mid-term survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to detect independent predictors for early and mid-term mortality. Follow-up was 97.7% complete, and a GNRI score ≤ 98 denoted malnutrition.  Results:   In the univariable analysis, GNRI [odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-0.96, p < 0.001] and CFS (OR 2.00 95% CI 1.38-2.94, p < 0.001) were identified as significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Mid-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with malnutrition (3 and 5 year survival rates 83.9 and 76.9%, respectively, p < 0.001). Mid-term freedom from major cardiac and cerebrovascular events was significantly decreased in patients with malnutrition (p = 0.039). The CFS (hazard ratio 1.78) and GNRI (hazard ratio 0.95) were independent risk factors for mid-term survival in the univariable and multivariable analyses, respectively.

The risk factors or predictors of kyphosis have not been sufficiently evaluated.  Purpose:   To assess the risk factors for kyphosis following laminoplasty.  Study design:   Retrospective study.  Patient sample:   Patients diagnosed with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) who underwent laminoplasty between May 2011 and October 2018 were enrolled.  Outcome measures:   Changes in lordosis and range of motion (ROM).  Methods:   Radiological imaging data were collected from simple neutral and flexion-extension radiographs at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. The ROM from the neutral position to complete flexion was defined as the flexion capacity, and the ROM from the neutral position to complete extension was defined as the extension capacity.  Results:   This study included 53 patients (mean age, 59.3 years). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that, the smaller the preoperative extension capacity, the greater was the decrease in lordosis (p=.025), while the larger the T1 slope, the greater was the decrease in lordosis following laminoplasty (p= .008). Correlation analysis revealed that C2-7 lordosis increased with increasing baseline T1 slope before surgery (p< .01). In patients with large preoperative C2-7 lordosis, the postoperative decrease in ROM tended to be greater (p= .028). However, the degree of lordosis and ROM reduction did not demonstrate a clear correlation with the clinical outcomes at 2 years after surgery.

In this study, we investigated associations between immune-regulating cytokines, T cell differentiation, and clinical outcomes. We included 80 children undergoing allogeneic HSCT for acute leukemia using bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells grafted from a matched sibling or unrelated donor. Cytokines (IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, SCF, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-α) and active anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) levels were longitudinally measured along with extended T cell phenotyping. The cytokine profiles showed a temporary rise in IL-7 and IL-15 during lymphopenia, which was strongly dependent on exposure to active ATG. High levels of IL-7 and IL-15 from graft infusion to day +30 were predictive of slower T cell recovery during the first 2 mo post-HSCT; however, because of a major expansion of memory T cell stages, only naive T cells remained decreased after 3 mo (p < 0.05). No differential effect was seen on polarization of CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells or regulatory T cells. Low levels of IL-7 and IL-15 at day +14 were associated with acute graft-versus-host disease grades II-IV in ATG-treated patients (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0002, respectively). Children with IL-7 levels comparable to healthy controls at day +14 post-HSCT were less likely to develop EBV reactivation posttransplant.

This study aims to evaluate whether a short course of antimicrobial therapy is safe and effective in cases with ASB before urological procedures.  Methodology:   We retrospectively reviewed adult patients who had ASB before undergoing several urological procedures between 2011 and 2019. The patients received a single dose of an appropriate parenteral antibiotic, determined by antimicrobial sensitivity testing, 30 to 60 minutes before the urological procedure. If a urinary catheter was placed post-procedure, a second dose was given.  Results:   A total of 293 patients who had ASB before undergoing several urological procedures were included in the study. The total number of procedures was 328. Female/male ratio was 92 (31.4%)/201 (68.6%). The mean age was 63.7 ± 14.9 years. The most common isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (155 [47%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (38 [11.6%]), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28 [8.5%]). The most common antimicrobial used was ertapenem. A second dose antimicrobial was given for 290 procedures due to a urinary catheter after a urological procedure. The mean hospitalization time was 3.97 ± 3.42 days. None of the patients developed infectious complications.

Conversely, postoperative CEA (post-CEA) is occasionally measured, and high post-CEA patients often develop recurrence; however, the clinical significance of post-CEA testing is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether post-CEA elevation might indicate a poor prognosis for stage II-III CRC patients who underwent curative surgery.  Patients and methods:   482 patients with pathological stage II-III CRC were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate post-CEA levels.  Results:   Multivariate analysis showed that elevated post-CEA (hazard ratio (HR): 3.14, P < 0.001), pathological lymph node metastasis (pN+), and pathological T4 (pT4) are associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), and that elevated post-CEA (HR: 3.12; P = 0.002), pN+, pT4, age >70, and smoking are independently associated with poor overall survival. Subgroup analysis among stage III patients, in combination with the risk classification of the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) study, showed that elevated post-CEA is a significant indicator of poor prognosis for RFS in both low-risk (73.8% vs. 21.2%, P < 0.001) and high-risk (49.9% vs. 25.0%, P = 0.04) groups.

Methods:   We examined coronary arteries in KD patients with CAAs who underwent follow-up coronary angiography (CAG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Coronary arterial branches with no abnormal findings during the most recent CAG were classified into two groups. Arteries with an acute-phase CAA that later regressed were classified as group R; arteries with no abnormal findings on either acute or convalescent phase CAG were classified as group N. Coronary arterial wall structural changes were compared between groups using OCT.  Results:   Fifty-seven coronary arterial branches in 23 patients were evaluated by OCT. Thirty-six branches showed no abnormality during the most recent CAG. Both groups R and N comprised 18 branches. Maximum intimal thicknesses in groups R and N were 475 and 355 µm, respectively (p = 0.007). The incidences of media disruption were 100% and 67%, respectively (p = 0.02).

However, little evidence exists regarding the predictive impact of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) after local ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of PNI to predict recurrence and survival after operative microwave ablation in patients with early-stage HCC.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 341 patients who underwent operative microwave ablation for HCC in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-A at our institute between 2007 and 2015. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and evaluated factors related to prognosis in multivariate Cox regression analyses.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of patients' demographic and operational data on satisfaction by using Breast-Q Questionnaire.  Methods:   Breast-Q Questionnaire breast reduction module was applied to patients who had undergone breast reduction surgery by a single surgeon between 2016 and 2020 and who agreed to participate in the study. Demographic and operational data and Questionnaire results were analyzed with the help of SPSS Statistics V21.0 program by considering p < 0.05 as significant.  Results:   Of the 94 patients who had undergone surgery, 52 who agreed to fill in the questionnaire were included in the study. Mean age was 39 and mean body mass index was (BMI) 28.6 kg/m2. Forty eight (92.3%) patients had undergone surgery for noncosmetic reasons. Significant differences were found between the physical well-being scores of the participants whose BMI was <25 and those whose BMI was >30. It was found that physical well-being (p= 0.001) and the amount of tissue removed increased with the increase in BMI (p = 0.018). No association was found between the tissue removed, the change in bra sizes and satisfaction. Satisfaction with outcome of surgery was found as 84.51% ± 24.28. Linear association was found between pre-information given and Breast-Q scores (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In our study, it was found that the tissue removed, breast size and the change in bra size had no effect on patient satisfaction. Being informed was found to be directly related to satisfaction. Providing sufficient information, understanding the expectations and obtaining the desired cosmetic results is important. Although physical complaints are at the forefront in the decision of surgery, aesthetic appearance is more effective in being satisfied with the surgery. A breast the weight of which is reduced through breast reduction and which looks aesthetically beautiful can only please the patient.

Virtual simulation of the surgical result can assist with surgical planning and intraoperative decision-making. 3D printed anatomic models or surgical guides based on 3D images may help align surgeons with their original surgical plan. This study aims to evaluate the utility of 3D printed surgical guides as an intraoperative tool to help establish dorsal height and tip position.  Methods:   Patients undergoing rhinoplasty had preoperative virtual 3D surgical simulations performed. Simulations were used to create a 3D printed nasal kits containing ceramic models of the preoperative nose and simulated nose, sagittal contour guide, and customized postoperative nasal splint. Nasal guides were sterilized for continual intraoperative assessment of profile contour (i.e., dorsal height and tip position). Postoperative 3D images (1-3 months post-op) were then compared to preoperative simulations. The difference between z coordinates and y coordinates determined the difference in projection and rotation, respectively.  Results:   Fifteen patients met inclusion criteria for this study. With the use of 3D printed surgical guides, the final tip position was on average of 0.8±0.7mm from simulated projection and 0.3±0.2mm from simulated rotation. Similarly, projection for the cartilaginous and bony dorsum was within 1.0±0.8 and 0.8±0.7mm of the simulation, respectively.  Conclusion:   Virtual simulation is useful in defining aesthetic goals preoperatively, but the potential clinical value extends beyond this. 3D printed rhinoplasty guides extend the simulation's utility to decision-making intraoperatively. This technology offers a novel medium for anatomic reference, which may improve adherence to desired aesthetic goals.

This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of urethral botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) on non-neurogenic female DV. Based on the videourodynamic study (VUDS), the DV was classified into three subgroups according to the obstructive site. A successful treatment outcome was defined as an improvement of voiding efficiency by 10% and reported global response assessment by ≥1. The study compared therapeutic efficacy, baseline urodynamic parameters, and changes in urodynamic parameters between the treatment success and failure groups and among three DV subgroups. Predictive factors for successful treatment were also investigated. A total of 81 women with DV were categorized into three groups: 55 (67.9%) had mid-urethral DV, 19 (23.5%) had distal urethral DV, and 7 (8.6%) had combined BN dysfunction and mid-urethral DV after BN transurethral incision. The treatment outcome was successful for 55 (67.9%) patients and failed for 26 (32.1%). Successfully treated patients had a significant decrease of detrusor pressure, post-void residual volume, and bladder outlet obstruction index, as well as an increase in voiding efficiency at follow-up versus the treatment failure group. The logistic regression of urodynamic parameters and clinical variables revealed that a greater volume of first sensation of filling predicts a successful BoNT-A treatment outcome (p = 0.047). The urethral BoNT-A injection is effective in treating non-neurogenic women with DV, with a success rate of 67.9%.

Due to the increasing application of ESD, the number of non-curative resection after ESD is also growing, leading to escalating number of patients who require additional gastrectomy with lymph node dissection after non-curative ESD. However, effects of ESD prior to surgery on technical difficulties during operation for EGC remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of non-curative ESD on short-term surgical outcomes in patients who underwent additional surgical treatment using propensity score matching method.  Methods:   To evaluate the effect of ESD on short-term surgical outcomes in patients who underwent additional surgical treatment after a non-curative ESD procedure, patients were divided into two groups: (1) those who underwent additional gastrectomy after non-curative resection of ESD [ESD + Surgery (ES) Group], and (2) those who underwent gastrectomy as the initial treatment [Surgery Only (SO) Group]. To minimize differences in baseline demographic features that could potentially be associated with short-term outcomes, propensity-scored matching analysis was performed.  Results:   After propensity-scored matching (1:1 matching), 140 patients altogether were selected and analyzed in this study.

Methods:   Two readers evaluated single energy and SD CT data collected from 63 patients within one week after EVT. They diagnosed ICH or contrast staining, and graded ICH according to the Heidelberg and Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST) classification. Differences in diagnosis between single energy and SD CT were tested with Pearson's chi-squared test. Diagnostic values of single energy CT were calculated. Interrater agreement was based on Cohen's Kappa.  Results:   When spectral data were added to single energy CT, the diagnosis of ICH changed in 8 CT scans (13%): in 4, the diagnosis of ICH was rejected and in 4, initially undetected ICH was diagnosed. In an additional 3 patients, the ICH grade was modified. CT alone had 88% sensitivity, 87% specificity, 88% positive diagnostic value, 87% negative diagnostic value, and 87% overall accuracy for ICH compared to SDCT. Interreader agreement on the presence of ICH was 0.84 (95% CI 0.51-0.86) for spectral CT and 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.97) for single energy CT.

Therefore, it is important for clinicians to predict the impact of tumor-involved root resection on motor function in spinal schwannomas.  Purpose:   To investigate the role of intraoperative electromyographic (EMG) techniques in decision-making of tumor-involved root resection for treating spinal schwannomas.  Study design:   A retrospective analysis PATIENT SAMPLE: Sixty-eight patients with spinal schwannomas arising from C5-T1 or L3-S1 roots underwent total resection of schwannoma, including tumoral root.  Outcome measures:   Nerve root activation threshold, free-running EMG signals, visual analogue scale, and American Spinal Injury Association scale.  Methods:   During evoked EMG, nerve root activation threshold for tumoral root stimulation was recorded from muscles anatomically corresponding to tumoral root. During free-running EMG, abnormal EMG signals were identified as irregularly recurrent, monomorphic signals, low frequency (<5 Hz) or absent discharges recorded from muscles innervated by tumoral root. Clinical assessments were performed before, 3 to 5 day's and six months' after operation.  Results:   Sixteen (16 of 68, 23.5%) patients showed PMD, and muscle strength improved or was not affected in the other 52 patients. Absent myogenic responses were observed in 19 patients with non-PMD, and nerve root activation threshold in non-PMD group was higher than that in PMD group (p<.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that cut-off value of nerve root activation threshold for distinguishing functional and nonfunctional roots was 11.8 mA. A larger number of patients without PMD than with PMD showed abnormal free-running EMG signals (p<.05). At postoperative 6-months' follow-up, ten patients with muscle weakness after tumor-involved root resection showed functional recovery (full vs. partial recovery: 5 vs. 5), and intraoperative nerve root activation threshold in these patients was higher than that in the other patients without functional recovery (p<.05). Furthermore, there is negative relationship between the duration for full recovery and nerve root activation threshold (p<.05).  Conclusions:   Both evoked and free-running EMG can be used as supplementary tests for differentiating functional and nonfunctional tumoral roots in spinal schwannomas, and nerve root activation threshold may be also related to prognosis of patients with muscle weakness caused by tumor-involved root resection. Therefore, intraoperative EMG techniques may provide additional references in decision-making of tumor-involved root resection.""","""['Chaojun Zheng', 'Jian Song', 'Siyang Liu', 'Yu Zhu', 'Jianyuan Jiang', 'Dong Tian', 'Xinlei Xia']""","""[' Department of Orthopedics, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', ' Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Upstate Medical University, State University of New York at Syracuse, Syracuse, NY 10212, USA.', ' Department of Hand Surgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', ' Department of Orthopedics, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, China.

Outcomes from Two Large European Tertiary Pediatric Endourology Centers""","""Introduction: Although pediatric ureteroscopy has been increasingly performed, the evidence for its use in pediatric lower pole stones (LPS) is sparce. In this study we look at the effectiveness and outcomes of flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy (FURSL) in the management of LPS for a pediatric population. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from two large European tertiary endourology centers that specialize in pediatric kidney stone management. The study was registered as an audit at the respective hospitals. All data were cross-checked and analyzed using electronic operative notes, discharge records, laboratory systems, and patient correspondence. The inclusion criteria were patients ≤16 years with LPS having an FURSL procedure. Results: A total of 57 pediatric patients underwent FURSL for LPS. The mean age was 10.1 ± 4.7 years (range: 1-16.9 years) with a male-female ratio of 2:3. The mean single stone size was 9.45 ± 3.9 mm (range: 3-20 mm) and 31 (54.4%) had multiple stones. A preoperative stent was present in 18 (31.6%) patients and a postoperative stent or ureteral catheter was left behind in 32 (56.1%) patients. The initial and final stone-free rates were 82.4% and 98.2%, respectively, with 1.19 procedures per patient performed to be stone free. Although there were no intraoperative complications, there were only four (7%) minor complications (Clavien I) noted that were all simple urinary infections. No long-term complications were noted. Conclusion: Flexible ureteroscopy and lasertripsy achieve excellent outcomes for treatment of pediatric LPS. Although some patients might need a second procedure for complete stone clearance, FURSL may be considered as the first-line treatment of LPS.""","""['Lucia Mosquera', 'Amelia Pietropaolo', 'Yesica Quiroz Madarriaga', 'Erika Llorens de Knecht', 'Patrick Jones', 'Anna Bujons Tur', 'Stephen Griffin', 'Bhaskar K Somani']""","""[' Department of Urology, University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', ' Pediatric Urology Unit, Urology Department, Fundació Puigvert, Barcelona, Spain.', ' Urology Department, Fundació Puigvert, Barcelona, Spain.']""","""2021""","""2021 Oct""","""J Endourol""","""['Urolithiasis/Endourology.', 'Safety and Outcomes of using ureteric access sheath (UAS) for treatment of Pediatric renal stones: Outcomes from 2 tertiary endourology centers.', 'Outcomes and Long-Term Follow-Up with the Use of Ureteral Access Sheath for Pediatric Ureteroscopy and Stone Treatment: Results from a Tertiary Endourology Center.', 'Ureteroscopy and laser stone fragmentation (URSL) for large (≥1\xa0cm) paediatric stones: Outcomes from a university teaching hospital.', 'Flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy for stones >2\u2009cm: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Influence of Pelvicaliceal Anatomy on Stone Clearance After Flexible Ureteroscopy and Holmium Laser Lithotripsy for Large Renal Stones.', 'Paediatric kidney stone surgery: state-of-the-art review.']"""

Herein, we report our surgical technique and outcome of alar lifting technique for correcting tilted alar base.  Methods:   The medical records of 18 patients with alar base asymmetry who underwent rhinoplasty using the alar lift technique between January 2014 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The alar lifting procedure included a pointed ellipse-shaped excision of vestibular skin just inside the nostril sill, and sutures using 5-0 monocryl. Surgical outcomes were determined on the frontal view of facial images by comparing pre- and postoperative angles formed by a line drawn parallel to the lowermost part of both pupils and a line connecting the lowermost part of the base of the ala.  Results:   Of 18 patients, 12 (66.7%) were men, and 6 (33.3%) were women. The mean age was 31.8 years (range 16-55). The alar lifting technique was performed on the left side in 12 cases and on the right side in 6 cases, and concurrent tip plasty was performed in 15 (83.3%) cases. The mean alar tilt angle was 3.9 preoperatively and 2.0 postoperatively. The mean angle change was 1.9°. Sixteen (88.9%) out of 18 patients had decreased alar level discrepancy. No patient had complications.  Conclusions:   Our alar lifting technique can serve as a useful adjunctive technique in rhinoplasty in patients with a tilted ala.

Although the standard for pain control is utilization of opioids, this increases the risk of postoperative ileus and, if continued inappropriately, increases excess opioids circulating in the community. One strategy that proposes to limit postoperative opioids in kidney donors is the continuous infusion of local anesthetics (CILA), though the effect on patient outcomes is unclear.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative CILA to decrease opioid usage in kidney donors who undergo laparoscopic nephrectomy.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted of kidney donors who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy and received CILA (CILA group) compared with kidney donors who received standard-of-care (SOC) postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was the mean total oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) administered following surgery.  Results:   A total of 176 kidney donors were evaluated, 88 in each group. The mean OME administered in the CILA group was significantly higher than in the SOC group: 194.8 versus 133.5 mg (P = 0.003). Mean total postoperative administration of acetaminophen was also increased in the CILA group: 3736.9 versus 2611.6 mg (P = 0.0041). Mean length of stay following surgery was higher in the kidney donors who received CILA, whereas return to bowel function, time to ambulation, and pain scores were not significantly different.

Purpose:   To compare the radiological and clinical outcomes between groups receiving cement-augmented CPS and solid pedicle screws (SPS) in lumbar fusion surgery.  Study design/setting:   Retrospective comparative study PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 187 patients who underwent lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis from 2014 to 2019.  Outcome measures:   Radiological evaluation included screw failure, cage failure, rod breakage, and fusion grade at postoperative 6 months and 1 year. Pre- and postoperative visual analog scales for back pain (VAS-BP), leg pain (VAS-LP), Korean Oswestry disability index (K-ODI), and postoperative complications were also compared.  Methods:   Outcomes of patients with high risk factors for implant failure [old age, osteoporosis, autoimmune disease or chronic kidney disease (CKD)] who underwent open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with cement-augmented CPS fixation (Group C, n=55) or SPS fixation (Group S, n=132) were compared.  Results:   324 pedicle screws in Group C and 775 pedicle screws in Group S were analyzed. Group C had a significantly higher average age and lower T-score, and included more patients with autoimmune disease and CKD than group S (all p<.05). Clear zones, screw migration and loss of correction were significantly less frequent in Group C (all p<.05). Thirteen screw breakages were observed; they were only in Group C (4.0%) and all were in the proximal of the two holes. Interbody and posterolateral fusion rates were not significantly different. At last follow-up, all clinical parameters including VAS-BP, VAS-LP, and K-ODI scores had improved significantly in both groups. Postoperative complications were not significantly different in the two groups.  Conclusion:   In lumbar fusion surgery, using cement-augmented CPS in high-risk groups for implant failure could be a useful technical option for reducing acute radiological complications and obtaining clinical results comparable to those obtained using SPS in patients with low risk of implant failure.

A clinical dilemma may arise when a metastasis biopsy to determine the ER status cannot be performed safely or when ER heterogeneity is suspected between tumor lesions. Whole-body ER imaging, such as 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) PET, may have added value in these situations. However, the role of this imaging technique in routine clinical practice remains to be further determined. Therefore, we assessed whether the physician's remaining clinical dilemma after the standard workup was solved by the 18F-FES PET scan. Methods: This retrospective study included 18F-FES PET scans of patients who had (or were suspected to have) ER-positive metastatic BC and for whom a clinical dilemma remained after the standard workup. The scans were performed at the University Medical Center of Groningen between November 2009 and January 2019. We investigated whether the physician's clinical dilemma was solved, defined either as solving the clinical dilemma through the 18F-FES PET results or as basing a treatment decision directly on the 18F-FES PET results. In addition, the category of the clinical dilemma was reported, as well as the rate of 18F-FES-positive or -negative PET scans, and any correlation to the frequency of solved dilemmas was determined. Results: One hundred 18F-FES PET scans were performed on 83 patients. The clinical dilemma categories were inability to determine the extent of metastatic disease or suspected metastatic disease with the standard workup (n = 52), unclear ER status of the tumor (n = 31), and inability to determine which primary tumor caused the metastases (n = 17). The dilemmas were solved by 18F-FES PET in 87 of 100 scans (87%). In 81 of 87 scans, a treatment decision was based directly on 18F-FES PET results (treatment change, 51 scans; continuance, 30 scans). The frequency of solved dilemmas was not related to the clinical dilemma category (P = 0.334). However, the frequency of solved dilemmas was related to whether scans were 18F-FES-positive (n = 63) or 18F-FES-negative (n = 37; P < 0.001). Conclusion: For various indications, the 18F-FES PET scan can help to solve most clinical dilemmas that may remain after the standard workup. Therefore, the 18F-FES PET scan has added value in BC patients who present the physician with a clinical dilemma.""","""['Jorianne Boers', 'Naila Loudini', 'Celina L Brunsch', 'Sylvia A Koza', 'Erik F J de Vries', 'Andor W J M Glaudemans', 'Geke A P Hospers', 'Carolina P Schröder']""","""[' Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; and.', ' Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; and c.p.schroder@umcg.nl.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""J Nucl Med""","""['PET imaging of estrogen receptors as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer patients presenting with a clinical dilemma.', 'Whole-Body Characterization of Estrogen Receptor Status in Metastatic Breast Cancer with 16α-18F-Fluoro-17β-Estradiol Positron Emission Tomography: Meta-Analysis and Recommendations for Integration into Clinical Applications.', 'Clinical Validity of 16α-18FFluoro-17β-Estradiol Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography to Assess Estrogen Receptor Status in Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Feasibility and predictability of perioperative PET and estrogen receptor ligand in patients with invasive breast cancer.', 'Diagnostic accuracy and safety of 16α-18Ffluoro-17β-oestradiol PET-CT for the assessment of oestrogen receptor status in recurrent or metastatic lesions in patients with breast cancer: a prospective cohort study.', 'Invited Commentary: A Recently Approved PET Imaging Agent to Guide Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Advances in PET/CT Imaging for Breast Cancer Patients and Beyond.', 'Nuclear Receptor Imaging In Vivo-Clinical and Research Advances.', 'Chemotherapy Shows a Better Efficacy Than Endocrine Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with a Heterogeneous Estrogen Receptor Expression Assessed by 18F-FES PET.', 'Non-conventional and Investigational PET Radiotracers for Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

The prognostic value of RDW was investigated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, multiple logistic regression model, and net reclassification index (NRI).  Results:   We identified 1568 patients who met the inclusion criteria. High RDW was significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for potential confounders with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.513 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.699-7.266). The area under the ROC curve of RDW for in-hospital mortality was 0.7225.

Hypoxia induced immunosuppression may be a barrier to immunotherapy. Therefore, we examined the metabolic effect of anti-PD-1 therapy in a murine MEER HNSCC model as well as intratumoral hypoxia in R/M patients. In order to characterize the tumor microenvironment in PD-1 resistance, a MEER cell line was created from the parental line that are completely resistant to anti-PD-1. These cell lines were then metabolically profiled using seahorse technology and injected into C57/BL6 mice. After tumor growth, mice were pulsed with pimonidazole and immunofluorescent imaging was performed to analyze hypoxia and T cell infiltration. To validate the preclinical results, we analyzed tissues from R/M patients (n=36) treated with anti-PD-1 mAb, via immunofluorescent imaging for number of CD8+ T cells (CD8), Tregs and the percent area (CAIX) and mean intensity (I) of carbonic anhydrase IX in tumor. We analyzed disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using proportional odds and proportional hazards (Cox) regression. We found that anti-PD-1 resistant MEER has significantly higher oxidative metabolism, while there was no difference in glycolytic metabolism. Intratumoral hypoxia was significantly increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in anti-PD-1 resistant tumors compared with parental tumors in the same mouse. In R/M patients, lower tumor hypoxia by CAIX/I was significantly associated with DCR (p=0.007), PFS, and OS, and independently associated with response (p=0.028) and PFS (p=0.04) in a multivariate model including other significant immune factors. During PD-1 resistance, tumor cells developed increased oxidative metabolism leading to increased intratumoral hypoxia and a decrease in CD8+ T cells. Lower tumor hypoxia was independently associated with increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with R/M HNSCC. To our knowledge this is the first analysis of the effect of hypoxia in this patient population and highlights its importance not only as a predictive biomarker but also as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.""","""['Dan P Zandberg#', 'Ashley V Menk#', 'Maria Velez', 'Daniel Normolle', 'Kristin DePeaux', 'Angen Liu', 'Robert L Ferris', 'Greg M Delgoffe']""","""[' UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', ' Tumor Microenvironment Center, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', ' Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', ' Tumor Microenvironment Center, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA delgoffeg@upmc.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['The Evolving Landscape of PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Identification of factors related to immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'CD244 represents a new therapeutic target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Hyperprogression during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Targeting resistance to radiation-immunotherapy in cold HNSCCs by modulating the Treg-dendritic cell axis.', 'Vascular Normalization Was Associated with Colorectal Tumor Regression upon Anti-PD-L1 Combinational Therapy.', 'Role of the human solute carrier family 14 member 1 gene in hypoxia-induced renal cell carcinoma occurrence and its enlightenment to cancer nursing.', 'Quantitative Imaging of Hypoxic CAIX-Positive Tumor Areas with Low Immune Cell Infiltration in Syngeneic Mouse Tumor Models.', 'The role of AMPK in cancer metabolism and its impact on the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Review of biomarkers for response to immunotherapy in HNSCC microenvironment.']"""

Therefore, we aimed to characterize thalamic perfusion and diffusion related to ITD over time and their inter-relationships after middle cerebral artery infarction.  Methods:   Eighty-five patients with middle cerebral artery infarction who underwent diffusion kurtosis imaging and arterial spin labeling were retrospectively included. ITD was diagnosed as ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion present on ≥2 cerebral blood flow maps. The thalamic asymmetrical index was calculated as (ipsilateral value−contralateral value)/contralateral value×100%. Finally, the inter-relationships of thalamic perfusion and diffusion were analyzed.  Results:   ITD was present in 56/85 patients (65.9%, ITD+). In ITD+ patients, larger abnormal perfusion volume, higher perfusion-infarct mismatch and lower rates of focal hyperperfusion were observed than ITD− patients. Infarction affecting the corona radiata were more frequent among ITD+ patients. Mean kurtosis were slightly but significantly increased within the ipsilateral thalamus compared with the contralateral one in ITD+ patients of subacute and chronic groups, while fractional anisotropy was significantly increased in subacute group but decreased in chronic group for both ITD+ and ITD− patients. Mean diffusivity was significantly increased in ITD+ patients of chronic group. Furthermore, the AICBF was negatively and significantly correlated with AIMK and AIFA in ITD+ patients in subacute group, and AIMD, even after adjustment for abnormal perfusion volume and days from symptoms onset, in chronic group. ITD+ patients had significantly higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores at admission and discharge and also showed a trend to independent association with clinical outcome at discharge.  Conclusions:   The combination of arterial spin labeling and diffusion kurtosis imaging can reveal early, time-specific thalamic perfusion and diffusion changes after middle cerebral artery infarction.

In summary, MBLA was less likely to detect CSF bacteria before the start of treatment compared with MGIT culture, Xpert and ZN smear. MBLA and MGIT positivity fell during treatment because of detecting only viable bacteria, whereas Xpert and ZN smear remained positive for longer because of detecting both live and dead bacteria.

While the safety and efficacy of single agent ipilimumab and anti-PD1 antibodies in patients with autoimmune disease has been examined in retrospective studies, no data are available for combination therapy which has significantly higher toxicity risk. We sought to establish the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy for patients with advanced melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune diseases.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective study of patients with advanced melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune disease who received combination ipilimumab and anti-PD1 at 10 international centers from March 2015 to February 2020. Data regarding the autoimmune disease, treatment, toxicity and outcomes were examined in patients.  Results:   Of the 55 patients who received ipilimumab and anti-PD1, the median age was 63 years (range 23-83). Forty-six were treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab and nine with ipilimumab and pembrolizumab.Eighteen patients (33%) had a flare of their autoimmune disease including 4 of 7 with rheumatoid arthritis, 3 of 6 with psoriasis, 5 of 10 with inflammatory bowel disease, 3 of 19 with thyroiditis, 1 of 1 with Sjogren's syndrome, 1 of 1 with polymyalgia and 1 of 1 with Behcet's syndrome and psoriasis. Eight (44%) patients ceased combination therapy due to flare. Thirty-seven patients (67%) had an unrelated immune-related adverse event (irAE), and 20 (36%) ceased combination immunotherapy due to irAEs. There were no treatment-related deaths. Patients on immunosuppression (OR 4.59; p=0.03) had a higher risk of flare.The overall response rate was 55%, with 77% of responses ongoing.

Design:   This study evaluated 30,587 pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis from January 2004 to March 2020 at the cytogenic centre of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Samples from amniocentesis were cultured using the in-situ method. The types and distribution of level III chromosomal mosaicism (two or more cells with the same abnormality in two or more colonies and both culture dishes, clinically referred to as 'true mosaicism') were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   Among the 30,587 women, 78 cases (0.26%) of level III chromosomal mosaicism were identified. The types of chromosomal mosaicism were classified as sex chromosome mosaicism (SCM), autosomal chromosome mosaicism (ACM) and marker chromosome mosaicism (MCM), with SCM, ACM and MCM accounting for 58.97%, 32.05% and 8.97% of cases, respectively. The most common mosaic cell lines were monosomy X and trisomy 21. The most common mosaic cell line progressing to live birth was monosomy X.  Conclusions:   Mosaic monosomy X and trisomy 21 are the most common cell lines of true mosaicism determined by amniocentesis. Monosomy X mosaicism is the most common cell line in live births.

Material and methods:   We examined differences in BCR between patients with initial negative surgical margins at FS, patients with final negative surgical margins with initial positive margins at FS without residual PCa after secondary tumour resection, and patients with final negative surgical margins with initially positive margins at FS with residual PCa in the secondary tumour resection specimen. Institutional data of 883 consecutive patients undergoing RP were collected. Intra-operative whole-mount FS was routinely used to check for margin status and, if necessary, to resect more periprostatic tissue in order to achieve negative margins. Patients with lymph node-positive disease or final positive surgical margins were excluded from the analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusting for clinical covariates were employed to examine differences in biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) according to the resection status mentioned above.  Results:   The median follow-up was 22.4 months. The 1- and 2-year BRFS rates in patients with (81.0% and 72.9%, respectively; P = 0.001) and without residual PCa (90.3% and 82.3%, respectively; P = 0.033) after secondary tumour resection were significantly lower compared to patients with initial R0 status (93.4% and 90.9%, respectively). On multivariable Cox regression only residual PCa in the secondary tumour resection was associated with a higher risk of BCR compared to initial R0 status (hazard ratio 1.99, 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.92; P = 0.046).  Conclusion:   Despite being classified as having a negative surgical margin, patients with residual PCa in the secondary tumour resection specimen face a high risk of BCR.

Objectives:   To examine the (1) relationship between UE function and CC integrity and (2) relationship between CC integrity and changes in UE function following intensive interventions.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from a sample of convenience of 44 participants (age 9.40 ± 3.10 years) from 2 larger trials. Participants received 90 hours of Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT) or Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT). Unimanual dexterity (Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function [JTTHF]) and bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment [AHA]) were assessed preintervention and postintervention. CC tractography was reconstructed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and segmented into 3 regions (genu, midbody, splenium). Pearson correlations and regression were used to assess the relationship between outcomes and DTI parameters (ie, fractional anisotropy [FA], number of streamlines, and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity).  Results:   Both groups improved in bimanual performance (P < .01). The CIMT group improved in unimanual dexterity (P < .01). Baseline unimanual dexterity and bimanual performance correlated with FA and number of streamlines for most CC regions (P < .05). Following CIMT, pre-post changes in JTTHF were negatively correlated with axial and radial diffusivity of the CC, and AHA with splenium and number of streamlines for the CC, midbody, and splenium (all P < .05).

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with first-line afatinib. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) was measured at the third lumbar vertebra using routine conducted computed tomography (CT) images for evaluation of disease burden. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index (SMI = SMA/height2 ) ≤38.5 cm2 /m2 for women and ≤52.4 cm2 /m2 for men based on previous criteria. Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression modeling were used.  Results:   The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range,39-84 years). A total of 24 (68.6%) patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) related to afatinib were diarrhea (94.3%) followed by rash (77.1%) and paronychia (60%). Overall, 19 (54.3%) patients had dose reduction. Sarcopenic patients had a significantly higher rate of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea (75.0 vs. 27.3%, p = 0.011) and toxicity-related dose reduction (75.0 vs. 9.1%, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis also showed that sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] 51.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-1081.3, p = 0.01) was an independent risk factor for dose reduction of afatinib. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for afatinib was 12.0 months (95% CI: 10.6-13.4). Both dose reduction and sarcopenia did not affect therapeutic efficacy.

The integrity of the femoral nerve can be continuously assessed during these procedures by Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of the Saphenous nerve (Sn-SSEPs). Sn-SSEPs are technically challenging to acquire and necessitate advanced troubleshooting skills with a more rigid anesthetic regimen and physiological parameters. We performed a retrospective analysis of Sn-SSEP data for 100 consecutive lateral lumbar surgeries where the stimulation electrodes were placed distally below the knee and medial to the tibia bone (i.e., DSn-SSEPs). Monitorable baseline responses were present in 87% of patients after the exclusion of fourteen cases where the tibial nerve SSEP was absent, quadriceps transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (TCeMEPs) were absent or not utilized. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis, mean arterial pressure (MAP), inhalational anesthetic levels, reliability of ulnar and posterior tibial nerve SSEPs, and the reliability of femoral nerve innervated quadriceps TCeMEPs were evaluated but were not of statistically significant consequence between cases where the DSn-SSEP was present or absent in this study. We found the utilization of DSn-SSEPs to be a valuable adjunct to femoral nerve monitoring. Stimulation electrode placement is easy to palpate with clear anatomical borders. Significant muscle artifact and patient movement from stimulation do not affect waveform morphology, allowing for continuous and reliable monitoring.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance the antitumor T-cell response, and interferon-γ plays an important role in this process. Therefore, this study evaluated whether the number of interferon-γ-releasing peripheral T cells after phytohemagglutinin stimulation in the interferon-γ release assay might act as a biomarker for the response of non-small cell lung cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.  Methods:   Data were retrospectively collected regarding 74 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who had received immune checkpoint inhibitors. Pretreatment screening tests had been performed using the T-SPOT.TB assay, which quantifies the number of interferon-γ-releasing T cells (as immunospots) in response to phytohemagglutinin and tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation. Clinical factors and the number of spots in the T-SPOT fields were evaluated for associations with patient outcomes. The median number of spots was used to categorize patients as having high or low values, and the two groups were compared.  Results:   Relative to patients with a low ratio, patients with a high ratio of phytohemagglutinin/tuberculosis-specific antigen spots (i.e. more responsive T cells) had significantly better progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. When we only considered patients with negative T-SPOT results, a high number of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated spots corresponded to significantly longer progression-free survival.

However, nonanatomical resection, known as wedge resection (WR), which is performed to diagnose pulmonary nodules, can be problematic for clinicians performing VATS or robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VATS WR using multiplanar computed tomography reconstruction (CT MPR)-fluoroscopy after CT guided microcoil localization to achieve complete pulmonary nodule resection.  Methods:   Between January 2016 to December 2020, the medical records of patients who underwent CT-guided microcoil localization for suspicious malignant pulmonary nodules and VATS WR with CT MPR and intraoperative fluoroscopy were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   All 130 patients successfully underwent CT-guided localization. The success rate of VATS WR with CT MPR-intraoperative fluoroscopy was 98.5%. Mean operation time was 58 min (range 50-84 min). The postoperative complication rate was 3.1%, and no major postoperative complications were reported. The mean postoperative length of hospital stay was 4.7 days (range 4-8 days).  Conclusions:   VATS WR using CT MPR-fluoroscopy after CT guided microcoil localization is a safe and highly effective approach for complete pulmonary nodule resection. However, even in uniport VATS or recently performed robotic surgery, localization and resection of nonvisible, nonpalpable pulmonary nodules is a challenging problem.

In this retrospective study, we investigated whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (POCT) confers a survival benefit on patients who undergo curative esophagectomy.  Methods:   A total of 782 patients were enrolled in our study. The patients were divided into surgery alone (S) and surgery plus postoperative chemotherapy (S + POCT) groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to eliminate the differences in baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), which was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors influencing the prognosis.  Results:   Of 782 patients, 343 (43.9%) underwent S alone, and 439 (56.1%) underwent S + POCT before PSM. The five-year OS rates were 42.3% and 47.8% in the S and S + POCT groups (p = 0.080), respectively. After PSM (296 patients per group), the five-year OS rates were 48.7% and 56.2% in the S and S + POCT groups (p = 0.025), respectively. For different cycles of POCT, patients with more than three cycles had a better survival than those with less than three cycles. The significant predictive factors for OS were pN stage (HR = 1.861, 95% CI: 1.310-2.645, p = 0.001), number of dissected nodes (HR = 0.621, 95% CI: 0.494-0.781, p < 0.001) and POCT received (HR = 0.699, 95% CI: 0.559-0.875, p = 0.002), which were identified by multivariate Cox regression analyses in the matched samples.

The overall clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate per fresh embryo transfer were 2.8% (25/900) and 0.8% (7/900), respectively. Natural cycle IVF treatment led to seven successful deliveries during the period. All seven women who successfully delivered were poor ovarian responders who met the diagnostic Bologna criteria and, among them, three had elevated serum FSH levels on day 3 (range: 39.0-47.1 mIU/ml). All seven had full-term delivery, and no congenital abnormalities were observed in their infants. No significant difference was found in serum FSH level on day 3 between those with and without positive beta-HCG test results.

Methods:   Guided by ultrasound, 0.3 mL of CNs suspension was injected in the fusion node prior to NAC in 110 patients with local advanced breast cancer. Then the patients underwent breast surgery and total axillary lymph node dissection following 2-6 cycles of NAC. The distribution by intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) of positive nodes and black-stained nodes was researched, and the relationship between the distribution and lymphovascular invasion were investigated by response to NAC.  Results:   When patients were ranked by response to NAC (from sensitive to resistance), the number of positive nodes increased, as did the proportion of lymphovascular invasion, the number of black-stained nodes decreased. A significantly negative relationship was found between the number of positive nodes and the number of black-stained nodes (p < 0.001). The positive nodes in patients with sensitive consequence followed the rule from under the ICBN to above the ICBN. However, there was counter-example (skip metastasis) in the patients with resistance result.  Conclusion:   The regression of positive nodes follows the rule from upper to under, inner to outer in the patients with sensitive consequence to NAC. Long-term staining and tracing by CNs might provide an acceptable and feasible technique to investigate the regression of positive nodes, and would be a potential method for NAC-treated patients by using of ICBN.

Conclusions:   PTAAB occlusion could be useful in reducing the rate of post-operative uterine artery embolism and the amount of transfusion, and be useful in coping with patients with preoperative vaginal bleeding conditions, so as to reduce the rate of intraoperative applications of vasopressors and the postoperative ICU (intensive care unit) admission.

It is thought to have fewer adverse effects; however, recent studies have restricted its use in women of reproductive age due to the teratogenic impacts on cognition. Although alternative drugs have been used to treat patients in clinical follow-up, some patients have to return to using valproic acid. Our study aimed to determine the rate of return to valproic acid treatment in female patients with follow-up in our centre and the reasons for the return.  Materials and methods:   Female patients with genetic generalized epilepsy who were followed up in our centre were included in the study. Patient data were retrospectively obtained from file records. The patients were grouped by seizure subgroups, antiepileptic treatment used, electroencephalography characteristics, and seizure treatment response.  Results:   Sixty-three (31.7%) of the 199 patients had to return to VPA treatment. When the reasons for the discontinuation of other drugs were examined, non-response to treatment was found in 80.0% of patients, adverse medication effects in 18.3%, and 1.7% continued voluntarily. Patients who are JAE subtypes were more likely to return to VPA treatment than GTCS alone subtypes. A total of 7.4% of patients converted to VPA therapy had continued myoclonic seizures compared with 20.4% of patients treated with alternative drugs.

Methods:   Our retrospective study included 94 patients (34 with PCNSL and 60 with GBM). Model performance was assessed using various MRI sequences across 45 possible model and feature selection combinations for nine different sequence permutations. Predictive performance was assessed using fivefold repeated cross-validation with five repeats. The best and worst performing models were compared to assess differences in performance.  Results:   The predictive performance, both using individual and a combination of sequences, was fairly robust across multiple top performing models (AUC: 0.961-0.977) but did show considerable variation between the best and worst performing models. The top performing individual sequences had comparable performance to multiparametric models. The best prediction model in our study used a combination of ADC, FLAIR, and T1-CE achieving the highest AUC of 0.977, while the second ranked model used T1-CE and ADC, achieving a cross-validated AUC of 0.975.  Conclusion:   Radiomics-based predictive accuracy can vary considerably, based on the model and feature selection methods as well as the combination of sequences used. Also, models derived from limited sequences show performance comparable to those derived from all five sequences.

Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most serious complication of MIPD and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD). Contrary to expectations, conventional PJ in MIPD did not improve POPF rate and length of hospital stay. High POPF rates are attributed to technical issues encountered during MIPD, which include motion restriction and insufficient water tightness. Therefore, we developed wrapping double-mattress anastomosis, the Kiguchi method, which is a novel PJ technique that can improve MIPD. Herein, we describe the Kiguchi method for PJ in MIPD and compare the outcomes between this technique and conventional PJ in OPD.  Methods:   The current retrospective study included 83 patients in whom the complete obstruction of the main pancreatic duct by pancreatic tumors was absent on preoperative imaging. This research was performed from September 2016 to August 2020 at Fujita Health University Hospital. All patients were evaluated as having a soft pancreatic texture, which is the most important factor associated with POPF development. Briefly, 50 patients underwent OPD with conventional PJ (OPD group). Meanwhile, 33 patients, including 15 and 18 who had LPD and RPD, respectively, underwent MIPD using the Kiguchi method (MIPD group). After a 1:1 propensity score matching, 30 patients in the OPD group were matched to 30 patients in the MIPD group.  Results:   The patients' preoperative data did not differ. The grade B/C POPF rate was significantly lower in the MIPD group than in the OPD group (6.7% vs 40.0%, p = 0.002). The MIPD group had a significantly shorter median length of hospital stay than the OPD group (24 vs 30 days, p = 0.004).

Methods:   This phase II study enrolled 23 patients with colon or rectosigmoid cancer who were indicated for radical resection with laparoscopic colectomy using the 8 K UHD system. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥30 mL of intraoperative blood loss.  Results:   Of the 23 patients, 22 completed laparoscopic surgery with the 8 K UHD system. One patient was converted to the 2 K high-definition laparoscopic system due to technical difficulties with the 8 K UHD system during surgery. The median amount of intraoperative blood loss was 14 mL (range, 2-71 mL), and number of patients with intraoperative blood loss ≥30 mL was four (17.4%).

Research question:   How does the usefulness of ctDNA analysis compare with that of solid tumor biopsy analysis in patients with NSCLC?  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 370 adult patients with NSCLC treated at the City of Hope between November 2015 and August 2019 to assess the usefulness of ctDNA in mutation identification, survival, concordance with matched tissue samples in 32 genes, and tumor evolution.  Results:   A total of 1,688 somatic mutations were detected in 473 ctDNA samples from 370 patients with NSCLC. Of the 473 samples, 177 showed at least one actionable mutation with currently available Food and Drug Administration-approved NSCLC therapies. MET and CDK6 amplifications co-occurred with BRAF amplifications (false discovery rate [FDR], < 0.01), and gene-level mutations were mutually exclusive in KRAS and EGFR (FDR, 0.0009). Low cumulative percent ctDNA levels were associated with longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.85; P = .006). Overall survival was shorter in patients harboring BRAF mutations (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.24-4.6; P = .009), PIK3CA mutations (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.56-4.9; P < .001) and KRAS mutations (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.30-4.1; P = .004). Gene-level concordance was 93.8%, whereas the positive concordance rate was 41.6%. More mutations in targetable genes were found in ctDNA than in tissue biopsy samples. Treatment response and tumor evolution over time were detected in repeated ctDNA samples.  Interpretation:   Although ctDNA analysis exhibited similar usefulness to tissue biopsy analysis, more mutations in targetable genes were missed in tissue biopsy analyses. Therefore, the evaluation of ctDNA in conjunction with tissue biopsy samples may help to detect additional targetable mutations to improve clinical outcomes in advanced NSCLC.""","""['Moom R Roosan', 'Isa Mambetsariev', 'Rebecca Pharaon', 'Jeremy Fricke', 'Hatim Husain', 'Karen L Reckamp', 'Marianna Koczywas', 'Erminia Massarelli', 'Andrea H Bild', 'Ravi Salgia']""","""[' Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Irvine, CA.', ' City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', ' UC San Diego Health Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA.', ' City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', ' Division of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', ' City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.

Patients and methods:   Adult patients with incidentally discovered NFAAs were included. Patients with chronic diseases other than hypertension or obesity were excluded. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test was performed. Levels of plasma renin and aldosterone, as well as metanephrine fractions in 24-h urine were measured. We performed abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography to exclude hormonal hypersecretion and nonadenomas. The frontal QRS-T angle was calculated and verified based on surface ECG. Patients were grouped in terms of QRS-T angle as normal and abnormal, and the abnormal patients were divided into positive and negative subgroups.  Results:   Of all patients (n=58), six (10.34%) had abnormal QRS-T angles. Hypertension increased the risk of an abnormal QRS-T angle six-fold (odds ratio 6.000; 95% confidence interval 0.982-36.652, p=0.034).

We retrospectively investigated 563 patients who received LVAD implantation between 2004 and 2018. Diagnosis of LV-thrombus was verified with computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, or intraoperative LV inspection. The primary endpoint was 30-day survival free of stroke and pump thrombosis. Overall, 72 patients (12.8%) had a diagnosis of LV-thrombus. They were younger (51 years; IQR:41-59), affected by severely reduced ejection fraction (15%; IQR:10-20), more often presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy (61.8%) and INTERMACS profile 1 (33.3%). Preoperative atrial fibrillation was frequent in patients without LV-thrombus (38.9%). Conventional sternotomy was the preferred approach in LV-thrombus patients (77.8%), based on more HMII implantations in these patients (41.7%). Survival free of strokes and pump thrombosis at 30 days was comparable (P = .5751) between patients with (83.3%) or without LV-thrombus (80.9%). LVAD implantation in patients with preoperative LV-thrombus is safe and feasible.

Methods:   Records of immediate unilateral breast reconstructions performed from May 2017 to June 2019 were reviewed. PAP flap breast reconstructions were compared with standard deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstructions, and were grouped into single or stacked PAP flaps for further analysis.  Results:   Overall, 43 PAP flaps were performed to reconstruct 32 breasts. Eleven patients underwent stacked PAP flap reconstruction, while 17 patients underwent 21 single PAP flap reconstruction. The average body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 22.2 ± 0.5 kg/m2. The results were as follows: no total loss, one case of venous congestion (2.3%), two donor site wound dehiscence cases (4.7%), and one case of fat necrosis from partial flap loss (2.3%). When compared with 192 DIEP flap reconstructions, the final DIEP flap supplied 98.1 ± 1.7% of mastectomy weight, while the final PAP flap supplied 114.1 ± 6.2% of mastectomy weight (p < 0.005), demonstrating that PAP flaps can successfully supply final reconstruction volume. In a separate analysis, single PAP flaps successfully supplied 104.2% (84.2-144.4%) of mastectomy weights, while stacked PAP flaps supplied 103.7% (98.8-115.2%) of mastectomy weights.

Likewise, the acute and chronic changes that occur in the heart in response to injury, disease, and stress are well characterized, albeit not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how exercise and myocardial injury affect contraction-relaxation coupling. We retrospectively analyzed the correlation between the maximal speed of contraction and the maximal speed of relaxation of canine myocardium after receiving surgically induced myocardial infarction, followed by either sedentary recovery or exercise training for 10-12 wk. We used isolated right ventricular trabeculae, which were electrically paced at different lengths, frequencies, and with increasing β-adrenoceptor stimulation. In all conditions, contraction and relaxation were linearly correlated, irrespective of injury or training history. Based on these results and the available literature, we posit that contraction-relaxation coupling is a fundamental myocardial property that resides in the structural arrangement of proteins at the level of the sarcomere and that this may be regulated by the actions of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) on actin and myosin.""","""['Farbod Fazlollahi', 'Jorge J Santini Gonzalez', 'Steven J Repas', 'Benjamin D Canan', 'George E Billman', 'Paul M L Janssen']""","""[' Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""J Gen Physiol""","""['Effect of exercise training and myocardial infarction on force development and contractile kinetics in isolated canine myocardium.', 'Kinetics of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation are linked and determined by properties of the cardiac sarcomere.', 'Effects of exercise training on contractile function in myocardial trabeculae after ischemia-reperfusion.', 'Contractile abnormalities and altered drug response in engineered heart tissue from Mybpc3-targeted knock-in mice.', 'Mechanisms of exercise-induced improvements in the contractile apparatus of the mammalian myocardium.']"""

Methods:   Spectrum of indications and outcomes of surgery were analysed in a retrospective series of 133 SCN at a single high-volume center in Germany between 2004 and 2019.  Results:   Relevant symptoms justified surgery in 60% of patients with SCN, while 40% underwent surgery because of preoperative diagnostic uncertainty about suspected malignancy. There were 4 malignant SCN (3%). Ninety-day mortality was 0.75%, major morbidity - 15%, 10-year survival - 95%. Risks of malignant transformation and of postoperative mortality were similarly low.  Conclusions:   Surgery is reasonable and safe for symptomatic patients with SCN. Preoperative diagnostic uncertainty is the main reason for futile resections of benign asymptomatic SCN.

However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box.  Methods:   This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.  Discussion:   Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients with symptoms consistent with acute and subacute brain stem infarction who received magnetic resonance imaging, including axial and coronal DWI. Diffusion restrictions were identified by 2 independent raters blinded for the final clinical diagnosis in 3 separate reading steps: axial DWI, coronal DWI, and combined axial and coronal DWI. Lesion location and certainty level were both documented for each reading step. In cases of reader disagreement, an additional consensus reading was performed.  Results:   Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Of these, 124 patients (51.9%) were clinically diagnosed with brain stem infarction. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values were best for combined DWI assessment (90.3%, 99.1%, 99.1%, and 90.5%) compared with axial (85.5%, 94.9%, 94.6%, and 85.8%) and coronal DWI alone (87.9%, 96.5%, 96.5%, and 88.1%).

Purpose:   To describe children's pain treatment at home after laparoscopic appendectomy, and to compare self-reported opioid analgesic use to eCAP data and counts of returned pills.  Design:   Prospective exploratory and descriptive study METHODS: A convenience sample of 96 patients, 10-17 years of age, from a single urban nonprofit children's hospital consented to self-report pain treatment in 14-day diaries and use eCAP to monitor prescribed opioid use at home after laparoscopic appendectomy.  Results:   Patients were prescribed 5-45 opioid-containing pills (mean ± standard deviation 15 ± 7.2). Of 749 opioid-containing pills prescribed to 49 patients who returned data, 689 pills were dispensed, 167.5 were used for the reason prescribed, 488 were returned to families for disposal, and 53.5 were missing. The majority of the 49 patients were opioid naïve (72%), Caucasian (64%), and male (56%), with a mean age of 14 years.

Methods:   This was a single-dose, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study evaluating two treatments over two periods with a washout interval between treatments. Fifty healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of the test drug MMF 190 mg as 2 × 95 mg delayed-release capsules or the reference drug DMF 240 mg as a 1 × 240-mg delayed-release capsule. Blood samples were obtained prior to dosing and at prespecified time points through 24 h post-dose to determine plasma concentrations of MMF. The pharmacokinetic parameters of MMF were calculated including maximum observed concentration, time to reach maximum observed concentration, apparent half-life of the drug in plasma, AUC0-t which is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero (dosing time) to the last time point, t, with measurable analyte concentration, and AUC0-inf, which is AUC0-t plus the extrapolated AUC from time t to infinity.  Results:   The geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of the test drug MMF vs the reference drug DMF were 96.80% (92.18-101.64), 96.35% (91.81-101.12), and 104.84% (95.54-115.05) for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and maximum observed concentration, respectively. Two capsules of Bafiertam™ was safe and generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event for both products was flushing, 60% and 51%, for Bafiertam™ and Tecfidera®, respectively.  Conclusions:   Based on the statistical analysis results of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MMF, a single oral dose of two Bafiertam™ DR 95 mg capsules is bioequivalent to a single oral dose of one Tecfidera® DR 240 mg capsule.

The prognostic role of AC subtypes has been debated and remains unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for each subtype of AC and to compare these with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [PDAC] and distal cholangiocarcinoma [DCC].  Methods:   PDs performed for AC between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Histological subtype was obtained for all patients. One-year, 3-year and 5-year disease-free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare Pb-AC, In-AC and mixed-AC. Comparison with PDs performed for PDAC and DCC during the same period was also performed.  Results:   A total of 97 patients undergoing PD for AC were evaluated: 34 (35.1%) In-AC, 54 (55.7%) Pb-AC and 9 mixed-AC (9.3%). DFS and OS rates for Pb-AC were significantly lower compared to In-AC (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01), but similar to mixed-AC (p = 0.3 and p = 0.4). Adjuvant therapy was not associated with increased survival, regardless of the histological subtype (p > 0.05). During the same period, 337 and 53 PDs for PDAC and DCC, respectively, were performed. In-AC was associated with significantly better outcomes compared to PDAC and DCC (p < 0.001); DFS and OS rates for Pb-AC and mixed AC were significantly higher compared to PDAC (p < 0.001), but similar to DCC (p > 0.05).

The adjusted hazard ratio for major adverse cardiovascular events versus no ASVD was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00–1.56) for ASVD 1, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.02–1.76) for ASVD 2, and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.24–2.99) for ASVD 3–4. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause death versus no ASVD was 1.32 (1.01–1.74), 1.47 (1.06–2.03), and 2.39 (1.47–3.89), respectively. Among ASVD components, the presence of symptomatic or asymptomatic extracranial atherosclerosis was a more potent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (1.27 [1.05–1.54]) and all-cause death (1.45 [1.17–1.81]).  Conclusions:   ASVD burden with AF can be a cumulative marker of a high risk for untoward vascular outcomes.

While mitigating unnecessary crowding in hospitals is favourable to reduce viral transmission, it is more important to prevent readmissions with impaired clinical status due to initially inappropriate level of care. A validated predictive tool to assist clinical decisions for patient triage and facilitate remote stratification is of critical importance.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study in patients with confirmed COVID-19 stratified into two levels of care, namely ambulatory care and hospitalization. Data on socio-demographics, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were collected during the first (N = 571) and second waves (N = 174) of the pandemic in Belgium (2 March to 6 December 2020). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to build and validate the prediction model.  Results:   Significant predictors of hospitalization were old age (OR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.06-1.10), male gender (OR = 4.41, 95%CI: 2.58-7.52), dyspnoea (OR 6.11, 95%CI: 3.58-10.45), dry cough (OR 2.89, 95%CI: 1.54-5.41), wet cough (OR 4.62, 95%CI: 1.93-11.06), hypertension (OR 2.20, 95%CI: 1.17-4.16) and renal failure (OR 5.39, 95%CI: 1.00-29.00).

Methods:   We performed a retrospective case series study of 98 patients who underwent thrombectomy followed by angioplasty with or without stenting to treat intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related large-vessel occlusion. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who received continuous intravenous infusion of tirofiban for 12 hours after procedure (intravenous tirofiban group, n=30) and those who did not receive postprocedural intravenous tirofiban (control group, n=68). The following treatment outcomes in the 2 groups were compared: early reocclusion of treated arteries on computed tomography angiography, parenchymal hematoma, symptomatic hemorrhage, and 90-day functional outcome.  Results:   Early reocclusion occurred in 18 patients (18.4%). The rate of early reocclusion was significantly lower in the intravenous tirofiban group than in the control group (3.3% versus 25%, P<0.001). The rates of parenchymal hematoma, symptomatic hemorrhage, 90-day good outcome, and mortality were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In multivariate logistic analysis, the only independent predictor of early reocclusion was no use of intravenous tirofiban (odds ratio, 9.212 [95% CI, 1.155-73.495], P=0.036). A good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) was significantly less frequent in patients with early reocclusion than in those without it (16.7% versus 72.5%, P<0.001).  Conclusions:   The use of intravenous tirofiban for 12 hours was associated with decreased risk of early reocclusion of treated arteries, with no increased risk of hemorrhage after emergent angioplasty, with or without stenting, in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related large-vessel occlusion stroke.

However, BIPSS is an invasive procedure, and its availability is limited. We retrospectively analysed the 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) level during the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) and plasma ACTH/cortisol levels after the desmopressin stimulation test (DDAVP test) in subjects with confirmed Cushing's disease (CD) (n = 92) and ectopic ACTH-dependent CS (EAS) (n = 16), and evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the two combined-tests in the aetiological diagnosis of ACTH-dependent CS. The percent changes in UFC levels after the HDDST and in ACTH/cortisol levels after DDAVP administration relative to the corresponding basal levels and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were analysed. UFC suppression below 62.7% suggested a pituitary origin with a sensitivity (SE) of 80% (95% CI: 70-88) and a specificity (SP) of 80% (95% CI: 52-96).

The combination of both tests yielded an SE of 95.5% and PPV of 98.4% for CD, and significantly improved the efficiency of the differential diagnosis between CD and EAS.

Methods:   A multi-institutional retrospective study was conducted within the MITO Group.  Results:   A total of 91 patients were recruited. The median follow-up time from primary cytoreduction was 127 months (IQR range 91-179). Forty-nine patients (53.8%) experienced at least one recurrence (median time to first relapse 22 months, IQR range 9.5-57). At univariable analysis, significant predictors of relapse were: size of largest extra-ovarian lesion, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, type of implants. After multivariable analysis, the size of extra-ovarian lesions and the presence of invasive implants resulted as the only independent predictors of recurrence. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 96 months (95% CI, 24.6-167.3), while median disease-specific survival (DSS) was not reached. Twenty-nine patients (31.8%) attempted to conceive: 20 (68.9%) achieved at least one pregnancy and 18 (62%) gave birth to a healthy child.

This study aimed to identify the impact of direct invasion of peripancreatic lymph nodes on survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   A total of 411 patients with resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatic resection at two high-volume centers from 2006 to 2016 were evaluated retrospectively.  Results:   Sixty (14.6%) patients had direct invasion of the peripancreatic lymph nodes without isolated lymph node metastasis (N-direct group), 189 (46.0%) had isolated lymph node metastasis (N-met group), and 162 (39.4%) had neither direct invasion nor isolated metastasis (N0 group). There was no significant difference in median overall survival between the N-direct group (35.0 months) and the N0 group (45.6 month) (p = 0.409), but survival was significantly longer in the N-direct compared with the N-met group (25.0 months) (p = 0.003). Similarly, median disease-free survival was similar in the N-direct (21.0 months) and N0 groups (22.7 months) (p = 0.151), but was significantly longer in the N-direct compared with the N-met group (14.0 months) (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified resectability, adjuvant chemotherapy, and isolated lymph node metastasis as independent predictors of overall survival.

The clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes of ASCP are poorly understood due to the rarity of this disease. Recently, promising clinical responses in patients with pancreatic cancer have been obtained for antibodies against programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1). This study investigated the prevalence of PD-L1 expression and surgical outcomes of 56 ASCPs compared to 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs).  Methods:   A total of 56 resected cases of ASCPs were retrospectively reviewed; after matching for the T category, 100 PDACs were selected as a control group for comparison. Immunohistochemistry for p53, Smad4, and PD-L1 was performed in both groups.  Results:   The ASCPs exhibited distinct clinicopathologic features, such as larger tumour, location in the distal pancreas, frequent vascular invasion and distant metastasis. In survival analysis, 1-and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 51.8% and 17.9%, respectively, with a median follow-up 13 months. According to multivariate analysis, vascular invasion and T category remained independent predictors of OS. Patients with ASCPs showed poorer survival than patients with PDACs after matching for the T category (p = 0.03). p53 and Smad4 were aberrantly expressed in 42 (75%) and 28 (50%) cases, respectively. Under the condition of a 10% cut-off value for PD-L1 positivity, approximately 11% of ASCPs were positive for PD-L1.  Conclusions:   Approximately 11% of patients with ASCPs are assumed to be potential candidates for the application of antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1, as based on the immunohistochemical results for PD-L1.""","""['Sun Mi Lee', 'Chang Ohk Sung']""","""[' Department of Pathology, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju-si, South Korea.

Whether the prognosis of PC with peritoneal metastasis has improved with the advent of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) and modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvements in treatment outcomes of PC with peritoneal metastasis.  Methods:   We retrospectively investigated consecutive PC patients with peritoneal metastasis treated with chemotherapy at our institution between 2010 and 2019. We compared the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes according to the period of diagnosis (group A, 2010-2014; group B, 2015-2019) and chemotherapy regimen. We also examined the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS).  Results:   Among 180 patients included (GnP 88; mFFX 14; other regimens 78), distant metastasis was confined to the peritoneum in 89 patients. Although group B had a worse performance status compared to group A, median OS was significantly longer in group B. GnP and mFFX showed a significantly higher objective response rate and disease control rate in addition to longer progression free survival and OS compared to other regimens. The administration of GnP or mFFX, performance status, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ≥5 were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. Furthermore, the amount of ascites and extent of peritoneal metastasis were significantly associated with OS in patients with distant metastasis confined to the peritoneum.

However, its role in diagnosing genu varum in pediatric patients with vitamin D-deficient rickets is still unknown. To clarify the role of the serum ALP level in assessing the severity of genu varum, we retrospectively investigated this issue statistically using data on rickets such as serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, ALP, the level of creatinine as the percentage of the median according to age (%Cr), and the metaphyseal diaphyseal angle (MDA) in the lower extremities as an index of the severity of genu varum. A multiple regression analysis revealed that log ALP and %Cr values were negatively associated with MDA values. The former association was also confirmed by a linear mixed model, while iPTH was positively associated with MDA by path model analysis. To elucidate the association of ALP with MDA in the presence of iPTH, we investigated three-dimensional figures by neural network analysis. This indicated the presence of a biphasic association of ALP with MDA: the first phase increases while the second decreases MDA. The latter phenomenon is considered to be associated with the increase in bone formation due to the mechanical stress loaded on the lower extremities. These findings are important and informative for pediatricians to understand the significance of the serum ALP level in pediatric patients with genu varum caused by vitamin D deficiency.""","""['Masashi Mukai', 'Takehisa Yamamoto', 'Shinji Takeyari', 'Yasuhisa Ohata', 'Taichi Kitaoka', 'Takuo Kubota', 'Katsusuke Yamamoto', 'Eri Kijima', 'Yasuhiro Hasegawa', 'Toshimi Michigami', 'Keiichi Ozono']""","""[' Department of Pediatrics, Minoh City Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', ' Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', "" Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Metabolism, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan."", "" Department of Bone and Mineral Research, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Endocr J""","""['Physiologic Leg Bowing is not a Physiologic Condition but Instead is Associated with Vitamin D Disorders in Toddlers.', 'Association between leg bowing and serum alkaline phosphatase level regardless of the presence of a radiographic growth plate abnormality in pediatric patients with genu varum.', 'Vitamin D deficiency rickets in infants presenting with hypocalcaemic convulsions.', 'Spot the silent sufferers: A call for clinical diagnostic criteria for solar and nutritional osteomalacia.', 'Rickets in children induced by anticonvulsant therapy.', 'An overview of CYP27B1 enzyme mutation and management: A case report and review of the literature.', 'Alkaline phosphatase in clinical practice in childhood: Focus on rickets.', 'Effect of lateral wedge-shaped orthopedic insole on patients with genu varus: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Rickets in Children: An Update.']"""

This study was intended to propose an objective method based on a hand-held three-dimensional (3D) scanner to assist intraoperative symmetrical assessment, aiming to achieve better aesthetic results in reduction mammaplasty.  Methods:   Sixty patients were enrolled in the study from April 2018 to January 2020. Intraoperative 3D scanning was routinely performed on 29 patients (study group) to assist symmetrical adjustments during breast shaping. 3D surface scanning data of both groups were obtained at 3 months postoperatively to objectively assess breast symmetry. Postoperative symmetry scores in five aspects, including nipple-areolar complex position, inframammary-fold height, breast size, shape, and footprint, were rated by six independent observers based on anonymized photographs to subjectively evaluate pre- and postoperative breast symmetry of the two groups.  Results:   The bilateral breast volume difference of the study group was significantly smaller than the control group (39.1 vs. 113.3 cm3, p = 0.001), as well as the difference in nipple to inframammary-fold distance (2.79 vs. 7.43 mm, p = 0.01). The observer-reported results showed that breast reduction significantly improved postoperative symmetry in all five aspects compared with preoperative symmetry in the study group (P<0.001). Furthermore, postoperative symmetrical ratings of all five aspects in the study group were statistically better than the control group (P<0.05).  Conclusions:   Intraoperative 3D scanning provided a reliable method to assist symmetry adjustments and ensure better postoperative breast symmetry in reduction mammaplasty.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed 3610 oocyte retrieval cycles (in 2537 patients) and 1726 single vitrified-warmed blastocyst transfer (SVBT) cycles (in 1726 patients) performed in a single center between April 2018 and July 2019. Transfers of single vitrified-warmed blastocysts, confirmed by fetal heartbeat, were used to assess clinical outcomes. The clinical outcomes of ORES and StES were compared in both TLI and non-TLI. Groups were stratified according to maternal age (≤39 years old, young age group; ≥40 years old, advanced age group). A significant difference in ongoing pregnancy rates was observed between the ORES and StES groups when non-TLI was used (34.9 vs. 27.0%, respectively; p < 0.05), unlike when TLI was used. Furthermore, ongoing pregnancy rates were significantly higher in the ORES group (24.8%) than in the StES group (14.9%) in the advanced age group, unlike in the young age group when non-TLI was used.

We believe the elastic stable intramedullary nails (ESINs) can provide enough relative stability for humeral shaft fractures in certain adult patients.  Methods:   There are four new indications for using ESINs: (1) patient could not tolerate a sugar-tong splint but was a high risk for general anesthesia, (2) intramedullary canal narrowing (<7 mm), (3) long spiral or oblique fracture over the metadiaphyseal junction, and (4) obesity. All patients received retrograde fixation with two titanium elastic nails, except for one patient with a long spiral fracture over the proximal metadiaphysis. Patients had routine follow-up plain radiographs until bone union, and we evaluated functional results of patients by Mayo Elbow Performance Score and asked to complete Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score at the last outpatient clinic visit.  Results:   A total of 16 patients with a mean age of 54.4 years were included. The mean follow-up time was 14 ± 2.5 months, and the average time to bone union was 16 ± 4.3 weeks. There were no wound infections, loss of reduction, fracture nonunion, implant failure, or skin irritation expect for one nail back-out because of osteoporosis.  Conclusion:   We have reported good results using ESINs for the displaced fractures of the humerus in the four indication adults who would not be able to tolerate plate fixation or intramedullary nailing.

Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) are cystic neoplasms with mucinous epithelium surrounded by ovarian-like stroma. Extraovarian MCN occurring in the liver and pancreas have been well characterized. However, only rare case reports of MCN arising outside of these locations have been reported. MCNs arising in unusual locations should enter the differential diagnosis of mucinous intra-abdominal tumors and must be distinguished from more common mimics. Therefore, we aimed to examine a series of MCNs of the retroperitoneum and mesentery to characterize the clinicopathologic features of this entity. Methods and results. Seven MCNs arising in the abdominal mesentery or retroperitoneum were retrospectively identified. A clinicopathologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical (keratin 7, keratin 19, keratin 20, calretinin, inhibin-α, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), PAX8, CDX2, and CD10) analysis was performed. All 7 MCNs were from females with a median age of 41 years old and a median size of 8 cm. All cases demonstrated mucinous with or without concomitant non-mucinous epithelium overlying spindle cell ovarian-like stroma. Luteinized cells were noted. The epithelium was positive for keratin 7 and keratin 19 in all 7 cases, while the stroma expressed ER, PR, and SF-1 in all cases stained. Calretinin was focally positive in the stroma of 3 of 7 cases, while inhibin-α was focally expressed in 5 of 6 cases. Conclusions. These results highlight the clinicopathologic, histologic, and immunophenotypic similarities between MCNs of the mesentery, retroperitoneum, pancreas, and liver. Overlapping features suggest a common histogenesis for all MCNs, which could include periductal fetal mesenchyme, aberrant migration of primordial germ cells, or abnormal differentiation or metaplasia of the embryonic coelomic epithelium.""","""['Benjamin J Van Treeck', 'Rachel K Horton', 'Hee Eun Lee', 'Christophe Rosty', 'Rish K Pai', 'Rondell P Graham']""","""[' 195112Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ' Envoi Pathology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ' University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ' University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ' 23387Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Int J Surg Pathol""","""['Inhibin expression in ovarian-type stroma in mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.', 'Endometrial cysts within the liver: a rare entity and its differential diagnosis with mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver.', 'Immunohistochemical analysis of steroidogenic enzymes in ovarian-type stroma of pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms: Comparative study of subepithelial stromal cells in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.', 'Steroidogenesis in ovarian-like mesenchymal stroma of hepatic and pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms.', 'Primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the retroperitoneum.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reconstitution of different B cell subsets, both quantitatively and functionally, in SSc patients treated with AHSCT.  Methods:   Peripheral blood was harvested from 22 SSc patients before transplantation and at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 360 days post-AHSCT. Immunophenotyping of B cell subsets, B cell cytokine production, signalling pathways and suppressive capacity of regulatory B cells (Bregs) were assessed by flow cytometry.  Results:   Naïve B cell frequencies increased from 60 to 360 days post-AHSCT compared with pre-transplantation. Conversely, memory B cell frequencies decreased during the same period. Plasma cell frequencies transiently decreased at 60 days post-AHSCT. IL-10-producing Bregs CD19+CD24hiCD38hi and CD19+CD24hiCD27+ frequencies increased at 180 days. Moreover, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase increased in B cells reconstituted post-AHSCT. Notably, CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs recovered their ability to suppress production of Th1 cytokines by CD4+ T cells at 360 days post-AHSCT. Finally, IL-6 and TGF-β1-producing B cells decreased following AHSCT.

Methods:   Data of 112 patients with advanced and unresectable PDA who underwent chemotherapy in a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Information on age, sex, hematological investigations, including systemic inflammation-based markers and nutritional assessment biomarkers, and imaging parameters of skeletal muscle mass and visceral adipose tissue were retrieved from the patients' medical records. The efficiency of the Cox, Weibull, and standardized exponential models were compared using hazard ratios and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).  Results:   Results from the Weibull, Cox, and standardized exponential model analyses indicated that low skeletal muscle mass, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS), and the requirement of biliary drainage were associated with the highest risk of death, followed by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and the presence of ascites. The AIC value from the four significant parameters was lowest for the Weibull-exponential distribution (222.3) than that of the Cox (653.7) and standardized exponential models (265.7). We developed a model for estimating the 1-year survival probability using the Weibull-exponential distribution.

We investigated the outcome of anti-PD-1 therapy and its predictive markers by evaluating the immune-related tumor microenvironment.  Patients:   We retrospectively reviewed patients with advanced LCNEC treated with systemic chemotherapy. We also evaluated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (clone: 22C3), CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and the mutational profiles.  Results:   Seventy patients were enrolled, and 13 of 70 patients received anti-PD-1 therapy. The progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) of the anti-PD-1 therapy were 4.2 months and 39%, respectively. The overall survival of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy (n = 13) was significantly better than those treated without anti-PD-1 therapy (n = 57) (25.2 months vs 10.9 months; P = .02). Among the 13 patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, 10 patients (90%) had PD-L1-negative tumors.

Additionally, all 3 patients with TP53 mutation co-occurring with PIK3CA mutation (2 of 8 patients) or RB1 mutation (1 of 8 patients) responded to anti-PD-1 therapy.  Conclusions:   Anti-PD-1 therapy was effective regardless of PD-L1 positivity in patients with advanced LCNEC.

This study aimed to evaluate fixation of CVCs with topical tissue adhesive in patients (prone to bleed) undergoing cardiac surgery regarding its ability to reduce the incidence of pericatheter leakage.  Methods:   This randomized controlled trial included 150 patients > 15 years of age who were (1) scheduled to undergo elective cardiac surgery, (2) required CVC insertion at the internal jugular vein, and (3) scheduled for transfer postoperatively to the cardiac intensive care unit. We randomly assigned patients to a topical tissue adhesive group (TA) or a standard control group (SC). The primary outcome was a change in dressing immediately postoperatively due to pericatheter blood oozing. Secondary outcomes were the number of dressings, total dressings per catheter day, and composite outcome of catheter failure within 3 days. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Seven patients violated the protocol (three TA patients and four SC patients).  Results:   Regarding the primary outcome, the SC group exhibited a significantly increased incidence of dressing change immediately postoperatively due to pericatheter leakage compared with the TA group in both the intention-to-treat analysis (5.33% vs 18.67%, RR 0.25 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.79], P = 0.012) and the per-protocol analysis (5.56% vs 16.90%, RR 0.289 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.95], P = 0.031).

Specimens from 6 patients were examined histopathologically.  Results:   After the first month, the mean regression in the dorsum was measured as 1.4 mm. The decrease in dorsal height between 1 month and 6 months was significantly greater than the decrease between 6 months and late periods. According to the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) scale, the average preoperative score of the patients was 45, while the mean postoperative score was 81.5. The viability of chondrocyte cells was measured as 85-90% histopathologically.  Conclusion:   This approach has been evaluated as an application that satisfies both the surgeon and the patient due to the advantages of fat grafts such as preventing the cartilage and osteotomy lines from being palpated in thin-skinned patients, holding the diced cartilage grafts together by acting as a glue, increasing the viability of cartilage grafts.

We aim to evaluate the influence of time and collateral status on ischemic core overestimation.  Methods:   Retrospective single-center study including patients with anterior circulation large-vessel stroke that achieved reperfusion after endovascular treatment. Ischemic core and collateral status were automatically estimated on baseline CTP using commercially available software. CTP-derived core was considered as tissue with a relative reduction of cerebral blood flow <30%, as compared with contralateral hemisphere. Collateral status was assessed using the hypoperfusion intensity ratio (defined by the proportion of the time to maximum of tissue residue function >6 seconds with time to maximum of tissue residue function >10 seconds). Final infarct volume was measured on 24 to 48 hours noncontrast CT. Ischemic core overestimation was considered when CTP-derived core was larger than final infarct.  Results:   Four hundred and seven patients were included in the analysis. Median CTP-derived core and final infarct volume were 7 mL (interquartile range, 0–27) and 20 mL (interquartile range, 5–55), respectively. Median hypoperfusion intensity ratio was 0.46 (interquartile range, 0.23–0.59). Eighty-three patients (20%) presented ischemic core overestimation (median overestimation, 12 mL [interquartile range, 41–5]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted by CTP-derived core and confounding variables showed that poor collateral status (per 0.1 hypoperfusion intensity ratio increase; adjusted odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.20–1.65]) and earlier onset to imaging time (per 60 minutes earlier; adjusted odds ratio, 1.14 [CI, 1.04–1.25]) were independently associated with core overestimation. No significant association was found with imaging to reperfusion time (per 30 minutes earlier; adjusted odds ratio, 1.17 [CI, 0.96–1.44]). Poor collateral status influence on core overestimation differed according to onset to imaging time, with a stronger size of effect on early imaging patients(Pinteraction <0.01).  Conclusions:   In patients with large-vessel stroke that achieve reperfusion after endovascular therapy, poor collateral status might induce higher rates of ischemic core overestimation on CTP, especially in patients in earlier window time. CTP reflects a hemodynamic state rather than tissue fate; collateral status and onset to imaging time are important factors to consider when estimating core on CTP.""","""['Álvaro García-Tornel', 'Daniel Campos', 'Marta Rubiera', 'Sandra Boned', 'Marta Olivé-Gadea', 'Manuel Requena', 'Ludovico Ciolli', 'Marian Muchada', 'Jorge Pagola', 'David Rodriguez-Luna', 'Matias Deck', 'Jesus Juega', 'Noelia Rodríguez-Villatoro', 'Estela Sanjuan', 'Alejandro Tomasello', 'Carlos Piñana', 'David Hernández', 'José Álvarez-Sabin', 'Carlos A Molina', 'Marc Ribó']""","""["" Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology (A.G.-T., D.C., M.

Patients and methods:   Twenty-two ACC and 98 PA were retrospectively analyzed. These patients had been examined via routine pre-surgical two-dimensional ultrasound and CEUS. The examination results were confirmed by biopsy pathology. Qontrast 4.0 imaging analysis software was applied to obtain the maximum intensity (PEAK), time to peak (TTP), regional blood volume (RBV), regional blood flow (RBF), maximum signal intensity (SImax) and mean signal intensity (SImean) through quantitative analysis. The differences between ACC and PA were compared regarding the conventional ultrasound images and the quantitative parameters of CEUS. ROC curves were drawn to evaluate the diagnostic value of these parameters.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences between salivary gland ACC and PA in the manifestations of conventional two-dimensional ultrasound examination regarding morphology, internal echo and the boundary (p > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in PEAK, RBV, RBF, SImax and SImean between ACC and PA (p < 0.05). Additionally, the five quantitative parameters of CEUS were all highly accurate diagnostic indicators.

There has been no established qualitative system of interpretation for therapy response assessment using PET-CT for HNSCC.  Aim:   To assess response evaluation of nodal status in post-treatment PET-CT scans in HNSCC using a 5-point Likert scale (Deauville score [DS]).  Methods and results:   Retro-prospective analysis was performed of the nodal status of pre and post-RT PET-CT in patients diagnosed with HNSCC (n = 43) from May 2013 to March 2018. All eligible patients underwent a pre-RT PET-CT scan before the start of RT. Another post-RT PET-CT scan was performed 12 weeks after the completion of RT. The median time from completion of radiotherapy (RT) to post-RT PET-CT was 92 days; 80% of the patients had their post-RT PET-CT scan between 77 and 147 days after therapy. Of 43 patients (M/33, F/10, age range 18 to 80 years (median 54 years) selected for the study, good concordance was noted between DS and clinical response in these patients. The change in SUV from pre-RT PET to post-RT PET was analyzed using a paired t-test. The P-value was found to be statistically significant while comparing pre and post-RT SUVmax levels showing that RT had significantly reduced the SUVmax levels of the nodes in DS 2-3 groups whereas the number of patients was too small to allow a reliable calculation in DS 4-5 groups. It was found that 36/39 patients with DS 1-3 had no nodal recurrence showing a high NPV of 92.3%. Of the four patients with DS 4-5, all had active disease showing PPV of 100%. Applying Fisher's exact test, the P-value was found to be .004.  Conclusion:   DS seems to satisfy the requirements for a simple qualitative method of interpreting PET scans and for identifying patients requiring neck dissection.

We report the first retrospective study examining the steroid-sparing potential of infliximab in achieving durable and complete renal recovery for patients with CPI-ATIN. Data were collected from medical records of patients diagnosed with CPI-AKI with a kidney biopsy or clinical diagnosis of ATIN that was managed with GC and infliximab. Infliximab-containing regimens were used to treat 10 patients with CPI-ATIN. Four patients relapsing after GC therapy achieved durable and complete renal recovery, four patients experienced partial renal recovery, and two patients showed no improvement in kidney function. This is the first study evaluating clinical outcomes using an infliximab-containing regimen for treatment of relapsed CPI-ATIN in patients or patients failing to achieve complete response after primary therapy. Our data suggest that infliximab may be a treatment option for achieving durable and complete renal recovery in this patient population and represents a potential steroid-sparing strategy in challenging cases of CPI-ATIN.

Methods:   This single-centered retrospective analysis selected consecutive patients with invasive ductal biopsy-proven breast cancer, for whom divergent 18F-FDG PET/CT and axillary ultrasound imaging (and/or core needle biopsy if available) had been performed, and described clinical, histological, imaging, and surgery data.  Results:   This retrospective study included 560 patients and identified discordant results between 18F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound (suspicious 18F-FDG PET/CT and normal ultrasound imaging and/or core needle biopsy) in 20 (4%) patients.

Goal achievers had higher Satisfaction with Decision Scale scores (5.0 [4.7-5.0] vs 4.0 [3.8-4.8], P = 0.002), lower Decision Regret Scale scores (1.0 [1.0-1.4] vs 2.0 [1.1-2.7], P = 0.001), and better Patient Global Impression of Improvement scores (1.0 [1.0-2.0] vs 2.0 [1.0-4.0], P = 0.004). In prolapse surgery patients, postoperative Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory scores were similar; however, GNAs had higher postoperative Urinary Distress Inventory scores (17.0 ± 18.0 vs 45.8 ± 20.8, P = 0.01).  Conclusions:   Ninety-one percent of women achieved their presurgical goals, the most common being symptom relief.

Currently, the possibility of regulating gut microbiota to reverse these perturbations by developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies is being extensively investigated. The modulatory effect of vitamins on the gut microbiome and related host health benefits remain largely unclear. We investigated the effects of colon-delivered vitamins A, B2, C, D, and E on the gut microbiota using a human clinical study and batch fermentation experiments, in combination with cell models for the assessment of barrier and immune functions. Vitamins C, B2, and D may modulate the human gut microbiome in terms of metabolic activity and bacterial composition. The most distinct effect was that of vitamin C, which significantly increased microbial alpha diversity and fecal short-chain fatty acids compared to the placebo. The remaining vitamins tested showed similar effects on microbial diversity, composition, and/or metabolic activity in vitro, but in varying degrees. Here, we showed that vitamins may modulate the human gut microbiome. Follow-up studies investigating targeted delivery of vitamins to the colon may help clarify the clinical significance of this novel concept for treating and preventing dysbiotic microbiota-related human diseases.

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of high-risk features in clinical outcomes and whether high risk features are predictive of AC benefit in stage II AA.  Methods:   Patients with pathological stage II AA between 2010 and 2015 were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using ICD-O-3 morphology and topography codes: 8140, 8480 and C18.1. High risk stage II AA was defined as having at least one of the following clinicopathological features: T4 tumor, <12 lymph nodes examined, poorly differentiated histology, positive margins, or lymphovascular invasion. Patients with none of these features were defined as low-risk.  Results:   A total of 1040 patients with pathological stage II AA were identified. 51.0% males, 84.5% Caucasian; median age 61 (range, 19-90). 46.4% were determined to have high-risk stage II AA. High-risk status was associated with worse OS compared to low-risk in univariate (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.18-2.02; p = 0.001) and multivariable analyses (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.03-1.79; p = 0.028). High-risk stage II AA patients had significantly worse 5-year OS compared to low-risk patients (67.1% vs. 74.5%, p = 0.0013). AC was administered in 34.4% (n = 166) of high-risk patients and in 36.5% (n = 203) of low-risk patients.

This study investigates the effect that atorvastatin has when used as a postoperative adjuvant therapy on the prevention of CSDH recurrence after YL-1 puncture needle surgery.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 516 CSDH patients who underwent YL-1 puncture needle surgery was undertaken. Baseline characteristics including sex, age, history of injury, past medical histories (anticoagulation, liver dysfunction, heart diseases, malignant tumors, diabetes, hemodialysis, and chronic alcoholism), and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic indicators (bilateral, mixed density or signal, maximum hematoma width, and brain atrophy) were recorded. Differences in recurrence rates were compared between two groups: one with atorvastatin after surgery and one without.  Results:   516 patients (429 men and 87 women), aged 14-98 years (mean age, 67.09 ± 11.74 years) were included in the study. YL-1 puncture needle surgery was performed 610 times. 94 patients had bilateral surgery, totaling 184 procedures. 301 patients with 360 procedures were treated with atorvastatin after surgery, of which 25 had recurrent CSDH; recurrence rate: 7.0 % (25/360). 215 patients with 250 procedures had surgery without subsequent atorvastatin, of which 14 had recurrent CSDH; recurrence rate: 5.6 % (14/250). Univariate analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in recurrence rates between groups (P > 0.05). Baseline characteristics of the two groups (age, sex, history of injury, past medical histories, CT or MRI diagnostic indicators) also showed no statistical difference (all P > 0.05).

Objective:   To analyze the clinicopathological features and evaluate the prognosis of patients with villoglandular adenocarcinoma of the cervix.  Methods:   Patient characteristics, procedure, pathology, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed in patients with villoglandular adenocarcinoma between November 2006 and June 2019 from multiple centers in China. In order to explore the difference between villoglandular adenocarcinoma and routine adenocarcinoma, patients (FIGO 2009 stage IA1-IB2) who had complete data during the same time period were included.  Results:   A total of 60 patients with villoglandular adenocarcinoma and 104 with standard adenocarcinoma were included. The median age of the patients with villoglandular adenocarcinoma was 42 years (range 27-68). The most common 2009 FIGO stage was IB1 in 39 (65%) patients with villoglandular adenocarcinoma. A total of 23 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery (two total hysterectomies, 21 radical hysterectomies) and the other 37 patients underwent laparotomy (three total hysterectomies, 34 radical hysterectomies). A total of 56 patients underwent lymphadenectomy and three (5.4%) had positive lymph nodes. Fifteen (25%) patients had one or both ovaries preserved. Seven patients were lost to follow-up.

NHL in PLWH is more frequently associated with oncogenic viruses than NHL in immunocompetent individuals and is generally associated with increased PD-1 expression and T cell exhaustion. An effective immune-based second-line approach that is less immunosuppressive than chemotherapy may decrease infection risk, improve immune control of oncogenic viruses, and ultimately allow for better lymphoma control.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of patients with HIV-associated lymphomas treated with pembrolizumab±pomalidomide in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute.  Results:   We identified 10 patients with stage IV relapsed and/or primary refractory HIV-associated NHL who were treated with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inihibitor, with or without pomalidomide. Five patients had primary effusion lymphoma (PEL): one had germinal center B cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL); two had non-GCB DLBCL; one had aggressive B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified; and one had plasmablastic lymphoma. Six patients received pembrolizumab alone at 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, three received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 4 weeks plus pomalidomide 4 mg orally every day for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle; and one sequentially received pembrolizumab alone and then pomalidomide alone. The response rate was 50% with particular benefit in gammaherpesvirus-associated tumors. The progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI: 1.3 to 12.4) and overall survival was 14.7 months (95% CI: 2.96 to not reached). Three patients with PEL had leptomeningeal disease: one had a complete response and the other two had long-term disease control. There were four immune-related adverse events (irAEs), all CTCAEv5 grade 2-3; three of the four patients were able to continue receiving pembrolizumab. No irAEs occurred in patients receiving the combination of pembrolizumab and pomalidomide.

Studies suggest routine repeat imaging has little utility in patients with minimal ICH, no anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, and no neurological decline. Additionally, it is unclear which mTBI patients benefit from transfer for neurosurgery consultation. The authors sought to assess the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of routine repeat head CTs and transfer to tertiary centers in patients with low-risk, mTBI.  Methods:   Retrospective evaluation of patients receiving a neurosurgical consultation for TBI during a 4-year period was performed at a level 1 trauma center. Patients were stratified according to risk for neurosurgical intervention based on their initial clinical evaluation and head CT. Only patients with low-risk, mTBI were included.  Results:   Of 531 patients, 119 met inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight (74.0 %) received two or more CTs. Direct cost of repeat imaging was $273,374. Thirty-seven (31.1 %) were transferred to our facility from hospitals without neurosurgical coverage, costing $61,384. No patient had neurosurgical intervention or mTBI-related in-hospital mortality despite enlarging ICH on repeat CT in three patients. Two patients had mTBI related 30-day readmission for seizure without ICH expansion.  Conclusion:   Routine repeat head CT or transfer of low-risk, mTBI patients to a tertiary center did not result in neurosurgical intervention. Serial neurological examinations may be a safe, cost-effective alternative to repeat imaging for select mTBI patients.

Methods:   From May 2003 to December 2019, 3608 GC patients treated endoscopically or surgically at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were enrolled for the study. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was performed on all endoscopic and surgical gastric specimens. Clinicopathologic characteristics with Lauren classification, survival rate, and cancer recurrence were analyzed according to p53 overexpression.  Results:   Among 3608 GC patients, p53 overexpression was seen in 1334 patients (37%). p53 overexpression was associated with lower depth of invasion (P = 0.026) and Early gastric cancer (P = 0.044) in intestinal-type GC, and with advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001) and Advanced gastric cancer (P < 0.001) in diffuse-type GC.

A retrospective study of early embryonic development which was recorded and analyzed using time-lapse imaging was conducted. The kinetic markers of time to pronuclei fading (tPNf) and appearance of two to eight cells (t2-t8) were assessed. For embryos cultured to blastocyst, times to morula (tM), start of blastulation (tSB) cavitated, and expanded blastocyst (tB, tEB) were also recorded. A total of 2021 oocytes from 364 intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles were evaluated, of which 1223 (60.5%) were derived from young patients and 798 (39.5%) from those of AMA. The mean time points to t3, t4, t5, t6, tSB, tB, and tEB were significantly shorter for embryos derived from younger women, as compared to older women (p < 0.05). Overall, women who conceived presented a faster embryonic development, for both age groups. The mean time points of t2 and t8 were significantly shorter in patients who conceived versus not conceived (p < 0.05). We concluded that older women's age is associated with delayed embryonic development. Embryos that yielded pregnancy cleaved faster compared to those which did not, in both age groups.

Aim:   In this study, we aimed to find out the predictive power of C-reactive protein- lymphocyte ratio (CLR) for in-hospital mortality after colorectal surgery.  Methods and results:   A series of 388 CRC patients were enrolled in the present retrospective study which was conducted in a tertiary state Hospital in Ankara, Turkey. In-hospital mortality was the main outcome to evaluate the predictive power of inflammatory markers, while the other outcomes that would be evaluated as separate variables were LOS in hospital and LOS in ICU. In this study, there were 260 males and 128 females, and the mean age was 60.9. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.4% (n = 13) and age, APACHE II score and Charlson comorbidity index score were related to in-hospital mortality statistically. The mean LOS in the hospital was 13.9 days and LOS in ICU was 4.5 days. The CRP levels and the CLR levels were higher both in the preoperative and postoperative periods in the mortality (+) group and the difference was significant statistically (P = .008/ .002 and .004/ <.001, respectively). CLR in the postoperative period had the best predictive power with AUC: 0.876.

They were equally divided into DIBH and FB groups to compare between both methods in the setup reproducibility and create the appropriate planning target volume (PTV) margin. Ten patients out of the fifty were scanned in DIBH and FB to perform a dosimetric comparison with the strict acceptance criteria of the FAST trial.  Results:   All heart dosimetric parameters of the DIBH was significantly lower than that of FB (p < 0.001), and the lung V30% of DIBH plans was significantly lower than FB plans (p = 0.03).

A better understanding of treatment-related disparities and ways to address them are important to improving survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis using the National Cancer Database. Included in this analysis were 107,116 patients with metastatic NSCLC who were treated at academic centers (AC), community-based centers (CC), and integrated centers (IC) between 2004 and 2015. The primary end point was overall survival, with comparisons of AC, CC, and IC.  Results:   The survival disparity between AC and CC continued to grow over the study period, from a 5.7% difference in 2-year survival to a 7.5% difference. Treatment at IC was initially associated with survival similar to CC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93), however, later in the study period treatment at IC improved (HR, 0.74) outpacing the improvement in survival in CC (HR, 0.82) but not to the same degree as the improvement in AC (HR, 0.64). The improvement in survival at IC was noted predominantly in patients with adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.72; P < .001) but not in squamous-cell carcinoma (HR, 0.89; P value not significant).  Conclusion:   Treatment of metastatic NSCLC at IC was associated with improved survival during our study period compared with treatment at CC. This appeared to be histology-dependent, suggesting a treatment-related improvement in survival because over this period newer therapies were preferentially available for adenocarcinoma. Integrating care across treatment facilities might be one way to bridge the growing gap in survival between AC and CC.""","""['Sendhilnathan Ramalingam', 'Michaela A Dinan', 'Jeffrey Crawford']""","""[' Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.', ' Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.

To further characterize the genetic features of MLH1/PMS2-deficient endometrial cancers, the departmental database was searched for cases with dual MLH1/PMS2 loss and retained MSH2/6 expression which underwent MLH1 hypermethylation testing. Genetic testing results were obtained when available. One hundred seventeen endometrial cancers met inclusion criteria: 100 (85%) were MLH1-hypermethylated, 3 (3%) were low-level/borderline, 7 (6%) were nonmethylated, and 7 (6%) were insufficient for testing. Sixteen cases (12 MLH1-hypermethylated, 3 nonmethylated, and 1 insufficient for testing) underwent germline testing, 6 of which (37.5%) demonstrated germline variants of unknown significance (VUS) (MSH6, PMS2, POLD1, BRIP1, RAD51D, CHEK2) but no known deleterious mutations. Notably, however, the patients harboring the MSH6 and PMS2 germline VUS had clinical features concerning for Lynch syndrome. One nonmethylated, germline-normal case underwent somatic tumor testing, and demonstrated a somatic MLH1 mutation. In summary, MLH1-hypermethylation accounts for the vast majority of MLH1/PMS2-deficient cancers in a universally screened population, although MLH1 somatic and germline mutations can occur. Occasionally, patients with MLH1-hypermethlated tumors also bear germline VUS in other mismatch repair genes as well as genes implicated in other hereditary cancer syndromes, but their clinical relevance is unclear. Family and personal cancer histories must always be evaluated to determine the need for germline testing in women with loss of MLH1/PMS2, even in the setting of hypermethylation.""","""['Brett Kurpiel', 'Martha S Thomas', 'Mansoor Mubeen', 'Kari L Ring', 'Susan C Modesitt', 'Christopher A Moskaluk', 'Anne M Mills']""","""[]""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Int J Gynecol Pathol""","""['Lessons learnt from implementation of a Lynch syndrome screening program for patients with gynaecological malignancy.', 'Universal screening for Lynch syndrome in endometrial cancers: frequency of germline mutations and identification of patients with Lynch-like syndrome.', 'Germline MLH1 Mutations Are Frequently Identified in Lynch Syndrome Patients With Colorectal and Endometrial Carcinoma Demonstrating Isolated Loss of PMS2 Immunohistochemical Expression.', 'Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial carcinoma with MLH1 germline mutation and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation: a case report and literature review.', 'Universal endometrial cancer tumor typing: How much has immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability, and MLH1 methylation improved the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome across the population?']"""

No strategies to overcome ICI resistance have been described. We aimed to evaluate the use of ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 ICIs (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) combinations in patients with advanced HCC with progression on prior ICIs.  Methods:   Patients with advanced HCC with documented tumor progression on prior ICIs and subsequently received ipilimumab with nivolumab/pembrolizumab were analyzed. Objective response rate (ORR), median duration of response (DOR), time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were assessed.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were included. The median age was 62 (range: 51-83). About 68% were of Child-Pugh (CP) Grade A and 48% had primary resistance to prior ICI. At median follow-up of 37.7 months, the ORR was 16% with a median DOR of 11.5 months (range: 2.76-30.3). Three patients achieved complete response. The median TTP was 2.96 months (95% CI: 1.61 to 4.31). Median OS was 10.9 months (95% CI: 3.99 to 17.8) and the 1 year, 2 year and 3 year survival rates were 42.4%, 32.3% and 21.6%, respectively. The ORR was 16.7% in primary resistance group and 15.4% in acquired resistance group (p=1.00). All responders were of CP A and Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) Grade 1 or 2.

The aim of this analysis was to investigate the correlation between loss of function of PTEN and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this population.  Materials and methods:   Archival tumor blocks from patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were administered upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitors were retrospectively collected. The status of 4 genes (PTEN, TP53, c-MET, IGFR) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and it was correlated with overall response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Fifty-one patients were included. In multivariate analysis, PTEN loss (hazard ratio [HR], 3.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-7.66; P = .002), IGFR overexpression (HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.03-4.77; P = .04), liver metastases (HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.46-8.65; P = .005), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≥ 1 (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.04-6.34; P = .04) were significantly associated with shorter PFS.

The current literature is limited to mostly pararenal configurations. We examined our results in patients with SMA and/or Celiac artery involvement.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed for all patients undergoing parallel grafting during the period of 2014 to 2018 at a single institution. All patients had at least SMA with and/or without Celiac artery parallel grafting.  Results:   Seventy-nine patients (65% male, median age 74) were treated with 208 parallel grafts. Median ASA score is 4. Forty-nine cases were elective, 22 urgent, and 8 emergent. Mean pre-operative aneurysm diameter was 7.1 cm (4.6-15 cm). Self-expanding covered stents were used for the renal arteries (mean 6.3mm), and balloon-expandable covered stents were used for the SMA and Celiac (mean SMA 8.6 mm, mean celiac 8.3 mm). Axillary exposure was the choice of access in 68 patients (86%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. We defined this as aneurysm sac exclusion with patent visceral stent grafts, and absent to mild gutter leaks. Mean aortic graft proximal seal achieved was 48mm. Coverage extended above the celiac artery in 75% (10% stented and 65% covered). Median contrast volume was 145ml, operative duration was 4 hours, fluoroscopy time was 56 min, and EBL was 250 ml. Perioperative mortality was 6.1%. 4.5%, and 25%, for the elective, urgent, and emergent groups, respectively. There was no incidence of spinal cord ischemia. Axillary access was complicated in 4 patients, requiring patch closure of the axillary artery. One patient developed postprocedural ESRD from a rupture and ATN despite patent renal stents. Of those patients with a patent GDA and celiac coverage, 2 required a cholecystectomy. Nine patients had a persistent gutter leak at the conclusion of the procedure. Median follow-up was 12 months. On follow-up imaging, all SMA and Celiac stents were patent. Six renal stents were occluded and 2 patients progressed to ESRD, both solitary renal periscope configurations at the index procedure. Only 4 patients had persistent gutter leaks with 2 requiring reintervention. Ninety-five percent of patients demonstrated sac regression or stabilization with a mean sac size of 6.5 cm.

Methods:   Single center retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing fbEVAR after previous open (post-open fbEVAR group) or endovascular abdominal aortic repair (post-endo fbEVAR group) between January 2015 and December 2017. Primary outcomes were technical success and in-hospital all-cause mortality.  Results:   We identified 42 patients undergoing fbEVAR after previous open or endovascular abdominal aortic repair during this period. Twenty-one patients (post-open fbEVAR group) had previous open abdominal aortic repair, 13 with a bifurcated and 8 with a tube graft. Of these, 2 patients presented with pAAA and 19 with TAAA. Twenty-one patients (post-endo fbEVAR group) had previous EVAR. Thirteen patients presented with pAAA, 3 of them with additional type Ia endoleak, 2 with stent-graft migration and 2 with previously failed fEVAR. Eight presented with TAAA. Median interval between previous repair and fbEVAR was 84 months (IQR 60-156) for the post-open fbEVAR group and 72 months (IQR 36-96) for the post-endo fbEVAR group (P = 0.746). Eighteen patients (86%) had branched stent grafting in the post-open versus 11 (52%) in the post-endo group (P < 0.01). In 2 patients in the post-open group, 3 renal arteries were not catheterized due to severe ostial stenosis, resulting in technical success of 91% in the post-open and 100% in the post-endo fbEVAR group. Four patients (19%) in the post-open fbEVAR group died in hospital, 2 due to cerebral hemorrhage and 2 due to pneumonia, and none in the post-endo fbEVAR group (P = 0.101). There were 5 nonstent-graft-related reinterventions, 2 (10%) in the post-open fbEVAR group and 3 (14%) in the post-endo fbEVAR group (P = 0.844). After 12 months there were 4 events in the post-endo fbEVAR group: one renal artery stent occluded, one renal artery stent required relining because of disconnection and 2 type II endoleaks were embolized with coils. There were no reinterventions in the post-open fbEVAR group during 12 months.

To assess pigmentation, the pigmentation score was measured in each quadrant of the sclera and added together for a cumulative score. For subgroup analyses, patients were categorized into three groups according to the severity of myopia in the non-pigmented eye.Results: Fifty-five patients (110 eyes) were included. Spherical power and spherical equivalent were significantly less myopic in pigmented eyes relative to contralateral non-pigmented eyes. The spherical powers of non-pigmented eyes were positively correlated with the difference in spherical power between contralateral eyes (r = 0.697, p < .001). The pigmentation scores of pigmented eyes were positively correlated with the ratio of myopia inhibition (r = 0.373, p = .005). In subgroup analyses, pigmented eyes exhibited significantly less myopic spherical powers and spherical equivalents than non-pigmented contralateral eyes in the moderate and high myopia groups.

Methods:   We retrieved 32 667 encounters from 10 418 pediatric patients with a neoplastic condition from 16 hospitals in the Cerner Health Facts Database and built a mixed-effects model with patients nested within hospitals for inference on 75% of the data and reserved the remaining as an independent test dataset.  Results:   The mixed-effects model indicated that patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (in relapse), neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or bone/cartilage cancer have increased odds of readmission. The number of cancer medications taken by the patient and the administration of chemotherapy were associated with increased odds of readmission for all cancer types. Wilms Tumor had a significant interaction with administration of chemotherapy, indicating that the risk due to chemotherapy is exacerbated in patients with Wilms Tumor. A second two-way interaction between recent history of chemotherapy treatment and infections was associated with increased odds of readmission. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (and corresponding 95% confidence interval) of the mixed-effects model was 0.714 (0.702, 0.725) on the independent test dataset.  Conclusion:   Readmission risk in oncology is modified by the specific type of cancer, current and past administration of chemotherapy, and increased health care utilization. Oncology-specific models can provide decision support where model built on other or mixed population has failed.""","""['Kamila Hoenk', 'Lilibeth Torno', 'William Feaster', 'Sharief Taraman', 'Anthony Chang', 'Michael Weiss', 'Karen Pugh', 'Brittney Anderson', 'Louis Ehwerhemuepha']""","""["" Children's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, California, USA."", ' Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, USA.', ' Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, California, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jun""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Prediction of 7-Day Readmission Risk for Pediatric Trauma Patients.', 'A Novel Model for Enhanced Prediction and Understanding of Unplanned 30-Day Pediatric Readmission.', 'Hospital Readmissions After Pediatric Trauma.', 'Factors associated with 30-day unplanned pediatric surgical readmission.', 'A Statistical-Learning Model for Unplanned 7-Day Readmission in Pediatrics.', 'High frequency of viridians group streptococci bacteremia in pediatric neuroblastoma high-risk patients during induction chemotherapy.', 'Applicability of predictive models for 30-day unplanned hospital readmission risk in paediatrics: a systematic review.']"""

Purpose:   To assess diagnostic yield and safety of CT-guided biopsy of retroperitoneal lesions and compare CT findings in different disease categories.  Material and methods:   This retrospective analytical study included 86 patients with retroperitoneal lesions who underwent CT-guided biopsy from December 2010 to March 2020. All procedures were performed with co-axial technique and multiple cores were obtained and subjected to histopathology. Additional tests like immunohistochemistry or microbiological analysis were done depending on clinical suspicion. Diagnostic yield calculation and comparison of imaging findings was done by one-way ANOVA, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests.  Results:   CT-guided biopsy was technically successful in all cases with a diagnostic yield of 91.9%. Minor complications in the form of small hematomas were seen in two patients. Major disease categories on final diagnosis were lymphoma, tuberculosis, and metastases. A variety of malignant and benign soft-tissue neoplasms were also noted less commonly. With help of immunohistochemistry, lymphoma subtype was established in 88.8% of cases. Addition of microbiological tests like the GeneXpert assay helped in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in some cases. A mass-like appearance and vascular encasement was common in metastatic group and lymphoma.  Conclusion:   Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy is a safe method for the sampling of retroperitoneal lesions with high diagnostic yield.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TVNA in the diagnosis and staging of mediastinal tumors.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 35 cases of EBUS-TVNA. Cases were reviewed in the Cerner electronic medical records between March 2013 and October 2018. Records were reviewed for patient comorbidities, smoking status, anticoagulation intake, procedural details, sample results, and postprocedural complications.  Results:   Thirty-five EBUS-TVNA procedures were reviewed. Twenty-nine of them were performed by traversing the main pulmonary artery or its branches. Three involved transvascular access through the azygous vein, 2 via the brachiocephalic artery and 1 through the superior vena cava. Only 4 patients (11.4%) experienced postprocedural complications, which included mild hemoptysis, moderate hemoptysis requiring epinephrine and saline infusion, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a rapid ventricular rate on top of preexisting atrial fibrillation. The yield of TVNA for malignancy was 22 (95.6%) of 23 patients. Overall yield was 31 (88.6%) of 35, with a need for additional intervention in 4 (11.4%) of 35 patients.

However, few studies have compared outcomes of taTME and R-TME, especially for patients with low rectal cancer after undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). Thus, the objective of this study was to compare outcomes of taTME and R-TME for patients with low rectal cancer after undergoing nCRT.  Methods:   A total of 306 consecutive patients with low rectal cancer who underwent taTME or R-TME after nCRT between 2008 and 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified into two groups: 1) taTME surgery group (n = 94); and 2) R-TME surgery group (n = 212).  Results:   Clinicopathologic variables were comparable between the two groups. There was no significant difference in circumference margin involvement (1.1% in taTME vs. 2.8% in R-TME, p = 0.680) or distal resection margin (2.3 cm in taTME vs. 2.4 cm in R-TME, p = 0.629). Total operation time (239 min in taTME vs. 243 min in R-TME, p = 0.675) and major complications (including anastomosis site leakage, surgical site infection, and voiding difficulty) showed no significant difference between the two groups either.

This study assesses the use and efficacy of everolimus exemestane in patients with metastatic HR+ HER2- breast cancer previously treated with endocrine therapy (ET) or endocrine therapy + CDK4/6i.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of electronic health record-derived data for HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer from 2012 to 2018. The proportion of patients receiving EE first-line, second-line, or third-line, and the median duration of EE prior to next line of treatment (TTNT) by line of therapy was calculated. OS for patients receiving EE first-line, second-line, or third-line, indexed to the date of first-line therapy initiation and stratified by prior treatment received, was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results:   Six hundred twenty-two patients received EE first-line (n = 104, 16.7%), second-line (n = 273, 43.9%) or third-line (n = 245, 39.4%). Median TTNT was 8.3 months, 5.5 months, and 4.8 months respectively. Median TTNT of EE second-line was longer following prior ET alone compared to prior ET + CDK4/6i (6.2 months (95% CI 5.2, 7.3) vs 4.3 months (95% CI 3.2, 5.7) respectively, p = 0.03). Similarly, EE third-line following ET alone vs ET + CDK4/6i in first- or second-line resulted in median TTNT 5.6 months (95% CI 4.4, 6.9) vs 4.1 months (95% CI 3.6, 6.1) respectively, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Median OS was longer for patients who received EE following prior ET + CDK4/6i. EE second-line following ET + CDK 4/6i vs ET alone resulted in median OS 37.7 months vs. 32.7 months (p = 0.449). EE third-line following ET + CDK4/6i vs prior ET alone resulted in median OS 59.2 months vs. 40.8 months (p < 0.010). This difference in OS was not statistically significant when indexed to the start of EE therapy.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that EE remains an effective treatment option after prior ET or ET + CDK4/6i use. Median TTNT of EE was longer for patients who received prior ET, whereas median OS was longer for patients who received prior ET + CDK4/6i. However, this improvement in OS was not statistically significant when indexed to the start of EE therapy suggesting that OS benefit is primarily driven by prior CDK4/6i use.

These tumors are highly proliferative, with frequently increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) compared with differentiated thyroid carcinomas, and elevated programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels. These tumor properties implicate responsiveness to antiangiogenic and antiproliferative multikinase inhibitors such as lenvatinib, and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study, we analyzed six patients with metastatic ATC and two patients with PDTC, who received a combination therapy of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. Lenvatinib was started at 14-24 mg daily and combined with pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. Maximum treatment duration with this combination was 40 months, and 3 of 6 ATC patients are still on therapy. Patient tumors were characterized by whole-exome sequencing and PD-L1 expression levels (tumor proportion score [TPS] 1-90%). Results: Best overall response (BOR) within ATCs was 66% complete remissions (4/6 CR), 16% stable disease (1/6 SD), and 16% progressive disease (1/6 PD). BOR within PDTCs was partial remission (PR 2/2). The median progression-free survival was 17.75 months for all patients, and 16.5 months for ATCs, with treatment durations ranging from 1 to 40 months (1, 4, 11, 15, 19, 25, 27, and 40 months). Grade III/IV toxicities developed in 4 of 8 patients, requiring dose reduction/discontinuation of lenvatinib. The median OS was 18.5 months, with three ATC patients being still alive without relapse (40, 27, and 19 months) despite metastatic disease at the time of treatment initiation (UICC and stage IVC). All patients with long-term (>2 years) or complete responses (CRs) had either increased TMB or a PD-L1 TPS >50%. Conclusions: Our results implicate that the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab might be safe and effective in patients with ATC/PDTC and can result in complete and long-term remissions.

However, there have been relatively few studies comparing PMT outcomes to those associated with CDT. The present study was thus designed to compare short- and mid-term PMT and CDT patient outcomes following the treatment of DVT of the lower extremities.  Methods:   This study was a retrospective analysis of 98 patients treated at the 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University (Shenzhen, China) and Beijing Chao Yang Hospital (Beijing, China). All patients had undergone treatment for symptomatic DVT of the lower legs via either CDT or PMT. Clinical records and outcome data between the patients in these 2 treatment groups were compared.  Results:   Of the 98 patients analyzed in this retrospective study, 50 had been treated via CDT while 48 had undergone PMT. These PMT and CDT operations were associated with mean treatment durations of 0.97 ± 0.20 hr and 32.48 ± 7.46 hr, respectively (P < 0.0001). Complete lysis was achieved in 78 patients (42 and 36 in the PMT and CDT groups, respectively P = 0.057), while effective lysis was achieved in 96 patients (48 and 48 in the PMT and CDT groups, respectively P = 0.162), with lysis being ineffective in the 2 remaining patients. PMT was associated with a significantly decreased length of hospital stay, usage of UK dose, and treatment duration relative to CDT(P < 0.0001). No major complications or MACE incidence were noted in either group, although 18 patients in the PMT group suffered from bradyarrhythmia (P = 0.007). Clinical efficacy was achieved in 96 patients (48 in each treatment group) at time of discharge (P = 0.162). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-year primary patency rates did not differ significantly between these 2 groups (P = 0.442).  Conclusion:   PMT is an effective treatment modality in patients with symptomatic DVT. Relative to CDT it is associated with high treatment success rates, reduced treatment duration, and reduced hospitalization duration, although it is also associated with higher rates of systemic complications.""","""['Yu Tian', 'Zhiyong Huang', 'Kunhui Luo', 'Ning Zhang', 'Biao Yuan']""","""[' Department of Vascular Surgery, The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', ' Department of Vascular Surgery, Beijing Chao Yang Hospital, Affiliate of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

The objective of this study was to establish a simple and reliable scoring system for evaluating LPR consisting of both subjective and objective criteria.  Methods:   This retrospective study includes 124 patients presenting with symptoms of LPR. In all patients, reflux symptom index (RSI), reflux finding score (RFS), oropharyngeal pH monitoring (PHM) and transnasal oesophagoscopy (TNE) were performed and rated in a special scoring system.  Results:   A Horvath Score of 4-5 for severe LPR was found in 76 patients (61%), a score of 2-3 for non-severe LPR in 38 patients (31%) and a score of 0-1 for non-existing LPR in 10 patients (8%) by combining the 4 validated diagnostic methods.

Purpose:   To explore the utility of computed tomography (CT) in the differentiation of RO and chRCC.  Material and methods:   Twenty-five patients with RO and 73 patients with chRCC presenting with the central scar were included retrospectively. Two experienced radiologists independently reviewed the CT imaging features, including location, tumor size, relative density ratio, segmental enhancement inversion (SEI), necrosis, and perirenal fascia thickening, among others. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC, for continuous variables) or Kappa coefficient test (for categorical variables) was used to determine intra-observer and inter-observer bias between the two radiologists.  Results:   The inter- and intra-reader reproducibility of the other CT imaging parameters were nearly perfect (>0.81) except for the measurements of fat (0.662). RO differed from chRCC in the cortical or medullary side (P = 0.005), relative density ratio (P = 0.020), SEI (P < 0.001), and necrosis (P = 0.045). The logistic regression model showed that location (right kidney), hypo-density on non-enhanced CT, SEI, and perirenal fascia thickening were highly predictive of RO. The combined indicators from logistic regression model were used for ROC analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.923 (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the four factors combined for diagnosing RO were 88% and 86.3%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between necrosis and tumor size in all tumors including both of RO and chRCC was 0.584, indicating a positive correlation (P < 0.001).

Purpose:   To discriminate among high-grade pineal region tumors by combining apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) volumetric values and qualitative features in order to predict their histology.  Material and methods:   Twenty-two patients with high-grade pineal region tumors were assessed by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Margins, T2-weighted signal intensity, contrast enhancement, hemorrhage, calcifications, different volumetric ADC fractions (ADCmean, ADCmax, ADCmin) were evaluated and were compared to the histopathologic findings (cell count and proliferation index).  Results:   Our qualitative imaging data showed that only margins were different among different tumors and each tumor type showed peculiar age onset. ADCmean was found the best quantitative value to discriminate high-grade tumors of the pineal region. ADCmean correlated with proliferation index but not with cell count. ADCmean values were lower in tumors with higher proliferation rate and a significant difference in ADCmean values were found between germinomas and pineoblastomas, between germinomas and papillary tumors and between papillary tumors and pineoblastomas. Moreover, the cut-off value of 0.865 × 10-3 mm2/s for ADCmean (ADC mean threshold value) could differentiate germinoma from pineoblastomas with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity.

Methods:   Seventy-three macular hole with retinal detachment eyes were treated with posterior scleral contraction. A strip was sent across inferior-temporal scleral surface to posterior pole, then two ends were led out from nasal-inferior to temporal-superior areas. It was tightened to contract posterior sclera with designed axial length shortening ([10% of preoperative axial length-0.5] mm) after aqueous humor was drained from anterior chamber. Recovery was classified as type I (retinal reattachment with MH bridged) and II (retinal reattachment without MH bridged). Follow-up duration was 25.3 ± 18.0 months.  Results:   Axial length was 30.01 ± 2.27 mm at preoperation and shortened by 2.57 ± 0.82 mm intraoperatively. At final postoperation, maintained axial length shortening was 1.87 ± 0.92 mm. Forty-six eyes (63.0%) recovered as type I, 26 eyes (35.6%) as type II, and 1 eye (1.4%) unrecovered.

Subfoveal CT and CT at 750 µm superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal to the fovea were measured. The total choroidal area, vascular area, and stromal area were measured by the binarization method. The choroidal vascularity index was calculated by dividing the vascular area by the total choroidal area.  Results:   Forty-one eyes were included in the final analysis. The subfoveal CT increased from 49.85 ± 31.23 µm preoperatively to 75.74 ± 37.89 µm 1 month after macular buckling (P < 0.001), then decreased over time, coinciding with the trends of parafoveal CT, total choroidal area, vascular area, and stromal area.

Methods:   Patients undergoing open gynecologic surgery under an ERAS pathway from November 2014 through December 2018 were included retrospectively. All patients received pre-operative analgesia consisting of oral acetaminophen, pregabalin, celecoxib, and tramadol extended release, unless contraindicated. Patients received local wound infiltration with bupivacaine; the post-operative analgesic regimen was standardized. Patients were categorized by anesthesia technique: (1) inhalational, (2) total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), and (3) combined technique. The primary outcome was post-operative opioid consumption measured as morphine equivalent dose, recorded as the total opioid dose received post-operatively, including doses received through post-operative day 3.  Results:   A total of 1184 patients underwent general anesthesia using either inhalational (386, 33%), TIVA (349, 29%), or combined (449, 38%) techniques.

Individuals who are asymptomatically infected may act as reservoirs to facilitate transmission of NoV. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the viral agent and investigate potential transmission of NoV infection in a foreigner patient who had severe acute gastroenteritis after having a meal in a restaurant in Chiang Mai province, Thailand. The fecal specimens collected from the patient and 26 restaurant staffs were tested for the presence of gastroenteritis viruses by PCR and RT-PCR. The NoV positive cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and IC kits. The sensitivity of detection of IC kit B, as compared to those of real-time PCR, could detect the viral load down to at least 2.1 × 104 copies/g of stool. The diarrheic patient was infected solely with GII.3 NoV without co-infection with any other gastroenteritis viruses while 4 staffs (15.4%) were positive for different NoV strains (3 with GII.4 and 1 with GII.17) and all were asymptomatic. Interestingly, the GII.3 NoV strain detected in fecal sample of the patient was closely related to GII.3 NoV strains detected previously in fecal samples of children hospitalized with acute diarrhea in Chiang Mai, in the same year and the same geographical area where the patient was infected, suggesting the circulation and transmission of GII.3 NoV in this area. In conclusion, our data indicated that the patient was infected with GII.3 NoV and the virus was not directly transmitted to the patient by asymptomatic food handlers instead it might be transmitted by consumption of NoV-contaminated food provided by the restaurant.

As in vivo measurements of ESS are not possible, it must be calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this feasibility study we explore CFD-models generated from coronary CT-angiography (CCTA) using an individualised blood viscosity and a pulsatile flow profile derived from in vivo measurements.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively recruited 25 consecutive patients who received a CCTA followed by a coronary angiography including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and generated 3D models of the coronary arteries from the CT-datasets. We then performed CFD-simulations on these models. Hemodynamically non-relevant stenosis were identified in IVUS. They were isolated in the CFD-model and separated longitudinally into a half with atherosclerotic lesion (AL) and one without (NAL). ESS was measured and compared for both halves.  Results:   After excluding vessels with no IVUS data or relevant stenosis we isolated 31 hemodynamically non-relevant excentric AL from a total of 14 vessels. AL segments showed consistently significantly lower ESS when compared to their corresponding NAL segments when regarding minimum (0.9 Pa, CI [0.6, 1.2] vs. 1.3 Pa, CI [0.9, 1.8]; p = 0.004), mean (5.0 Pa, CI [3.4, 6.0] vs. 6.7 Pa, CI [5.5, 8.4]; p = 0.008) and maximum ESS values (12.4 Pa, CI [8.6, 14.6] vs. 19.6 Pa, CI [12.4, 21.0]; p = 0.005). Qualitatively ESS was lower on the inside of bifurcations and curvatures.  Conclusion:   CFD simulations of coronary arteries from CCTA with an individualised flow profile and blood viscosity are feasible and could provide further prognostic information and a better risk stratification in coronary artery disease. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate this claim.""","""['Adrian Curta', 'Ahmad Jaber', 'Johannes Rieber', 'Holger Hetterich']""","""[' Department of Radiology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Department of Cardiology, Privatklinik Dr. Robert Schindlbeck, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany.', ' Department of Medicine I, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021;79(""","""Clin Hemorheol Microcirc""","""[]"""

An evaluation of 15 141 active adolescents for conditions that put them at risk of sudden cardiac death""","""Objectives:   We assessed whether the presence and character of a cardiac murmur in adolescents were associated with structural heart disease that confers risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 15 141 adolescents age 12-19 who underwent a heart screen with history, physical examination and ECG. Participants with any screening abnormality underwent an echocardiogram for the assessment of structural heart disease. Murmurs were classified as physiological or pathological according to standard clinical criteria, and participants with murmurs were compared with a comparison group without murmurs. The primary outcome was echocardiogram-detected structural heart disease associated with SCD.  Results:   905 participants with a cardiac murmur (mean age 15.8; 58% male) and 4333 participants without a murmur (comparison group; mean age 15.8; 55% male) had an echocardiogram to detect structural heart disease. 743 (82%) murmurs were described as physiological and 162 (18%) as pathological. Twenty-five (2.8%) participants with murmurs and 61 (1.4%) participants without murmurs had structural heart disease. Three (0.3%) participants in the murmur group were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which was the only identified condition associated with SCD. Two participants with HCM had physiological murmurs, one had a pathological murmur, and all three had an abnormal ECG. The most common minor structural heart disease was bicuspid aortic valve in both the murmur (7; 0.8%) and comparison (20; 0.5%) groups. The positive predictive value of physiological versus pathological murmurs for identifying any structural heart disease was 2.4% versus 4.3% (p=0.21), respectively. The positive predictive value of having any murmur versus no murmur for identifying structural heart disease was 2.8% versus 1.4% (p=0.003), respectively.  Conclusions:   In adolescents, the traditional classification of cardiac murmurs as 'physiologic' or 'pathologic' does not differentiate for structural heart disease that puts individuals at risk for SCD.

Methods:   We established a committee of 54 globally recognized opinion makers in this field. The committee agreed to vote on several statements concerning SG. An agreement or disagreement amongst ≥ 70.0% experts was construed as a consensus.  Results:   The committee achieved a consensus of agreement (n = 71) or disagreement (n = 7) for 78 out of 97 proposed statements after two rounds of voting. The committee agreed with 96.3% consensus that the characterization of SG as a purely restrictive procedure was inaccurate and there was 88.7% consensus that SG was not a suitable standalone, primary, surgical weight loss option for patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) without dysplasia. There was an overwhelming consensus of 92.5% that the sleeve should be fashioned over an orogastric tube of 36-40 Fr and a 90.7% consensus that surgeons should stay at least 1 cm away from the angle of His. Remarkably, the committee agreed with 81.1% consensus that SG patients should undergo a screening endoscopy every 5 years after surgery to screen for BE.  Conclusion:   A multinational team of experts achieved consensus on several aspects of SG. The findings of this exercise should help improve the outcomes of SG, the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide, and guide future research on this topic.""","""['Kamal K Mahawar', 'Islam Omar', 'Rishi Singhal', 'Sandeep Aggarwal', 'Mustafa Ismail Allouch', 'Salman K Alsabah', 'Luigi Angrisani', 'Faruq Mohamed Badiuddin', 'Jose María Balibrea', 'Ahmad Bashir', 'Estuardo Behrens', 'Kiron Bhatia', 'Laurent Biertho', 'L Ulas Biter', 'Jerome Dargent', 'Maurizio De Luca', 'Eric DeMaria', 'Mohamed Hayssam Elfawal', 'Martin Fried', 'Khaled A Gawdat', 'Yitka Graham', 'Miguel F Herrera', 'Jacques M Himpens', 'Farah A Hussain', 'Kazunori Kasama', 'David Kerrigan', 'Lilian Kow', 'Jon Kristinsson', 'Marina Kurian', 'Ronald Liem', 'Rami Edward Lutfi', 'Vinod Menon', 'Karl Miller', 'Patrick Noel', 'Oral Ospanov', 'Mahir M Ozmen', 'Ralph Peterli', 'Jaime Ponce', 'Gerhard Prager', 'Arun Prasad', 'P Praveen Raj', 'Nelson R Rodriguez', 'Raul Rosenthal', 'Nasser Sakran', 'Jorge Nunes Santos', 'Asim Shabbir', 'Scott A Shikora', 'Peter K Small', 'Craig J Taylor', 'Cunchuan Wang', 'Rudolf Alfred Weiner', 'Mariusz Wylezol', 'Wah Yang', 'Ali Aminian']""","""[' Bariatric Unit, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, Sunderland, UK. kmahawar@gmail.com.', ' Faculty of Health Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, UK. kmahawar@gmail.com.', ' Bariatric Unit, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, Sunderland, UK.', ' Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', ' All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', ' Nini Hospital, Tripoli, Lebanon.', ' Kuwait University, Kuwait, Kuwait.', ' University of Naples, Naples, Italy.', ' Valiant Clinic, Dubayy, United Arab Emirates.', '0 Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', '1 GBMC at Jordan Hospital, Amman, Jordan.', '2 New Life Center, Guatemala, Guatemala.', '3 Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia.', '4 Quebec Heart and Lung Institute-Laval University, Quebec, Canada.', '5 Franciscus Gasthuis Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', '6 Polyclinique Lyon Nord, Rillieux-la-Pape, France.', '7 Castelfranco Montebelluna Hospitals, Montebelluna, Italy.', '8 East Carolina University, Greenville, USA.', '9 Makassed General Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon.', '0 OB Klinika-Center for Treatment of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, Prague, Czech Republic.', '1 Ain Shams School of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', '2 Faculty of Health Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, UK.', '3 Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico, Mexico.', '4 CHIREC Delta Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.', '5 Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, USA.', '6 Yotsuya Medical Cube, Tokyo, Japan.', '7 Phoenix Health, London, UK.', '8 Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '9 Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', '0 New York University School of Medicine, New York, USA.', '1 Dutch Obesity Clinic (NOK), The Hague, Netherlands.', '2 University of Illinois, Chicago, USA.', '3 University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, UK.', '4 Diakonissen & Wehrle Private Hospital, Salzburg, Austria.', '5 Bouchard Private Hospital, Elsan, Marseille, France.', '6 Mediclinic Parkview, Dubayy, United Arab Emirates.', '7 KF ""University Medical Center"", Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.', '8 Istinye University, Istanbul, Turkey.', '9 University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', '0 CHI Memorial Hospital, Chattanooga, TN, USA.', '1 Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '2 Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', '3 Gem Hospital, Chennai, India.', '4 Centro Médico Puerta de Hierro Andares, Zapopan, Mexico.', '5 Cleveland Clinic, Weston, FL, USA.', '6 Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', '7 Jorge Manuel Nunes dos Santos, Lisbon, Portugal.', '8 National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', ""9 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA."", '0 Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', '1 The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Department for Metabolic Surgery, Sana Klinikum Offenbach, Offenbach, Germany.', '3 Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', '4 Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Surg Endosc""","""[""Best practice approach for redo-surgeries after sleeve gastrectomy, an expert's modified Delphi consensus."", 'The first consensus statement on revisional bariatric surgery using a modified Delphi approach.', 'Patient Selection in One Anastomosis/Mini Gastric Bypass-an Expert Modified Delphi Consensus.', 'Reoperative surgery for nonresponders and complicated sleeve gastrectomy operations in patients with severe obesity.

The optimal bridging time has yet to be widely established, hence this retrospective study aims to determine the optimal bridging time to elective surgery post endoluminal stenting.  Patients and methods:   All patients who underwent colorectal stenting for large bowel obstruction in a single, tertiary hospital in Singapore between January 2003 and December 2017 were retrospectively identified. Patients' baseline demographics, tumour characteristics, stent-related complications, intra-operative details, post-operative complications and oncological outcomes were analysed.  Results:   Of the 53 patients who successfully underwent colonic stenting for malignant left sided obstruction, 33.96% of patients underwent surgery within two weeks of stent placement while 66.04% of patients underwent surgery after 2 weeks of stent placement. Univariate analysis between both groups did not demonstrate significant differences in postoperative complications and stoma formation. Significant differences were observed between both groups for stent complications (38.89% vs 8.57%, p = 0.022), on-table decompression (38.89% vs 2.86%, p = 0.001) and systemic recurrence (11.11% vs 40.00%, p = 0.030). Increased bridging interval to surgery (OR 13.16, CI 1.37-126.96, p = 0.026) was a significant risk factor for systemic recurrence on multivariate analysis.

This study aimed to investigate developmental changes of the cerebellar peduncles in second- and third-trimester healthy fetuses using motion-corrected DTI and tractography.  Materials and methods:   3T data of 81 healthy fetuses were reviewed. Structural imaging consisted of multiplanar T2-single-shot sequences; DTI consisted of a series of 12-direction diffusion. A robust motion-tracked section-to-volume registration algorithm reconstructed images. ROI-based deterministic tractography was performed using anatomic landmarks described in postnatal tractography. Asymmetry was evaluated qualitatively with a perceived difference of >25% between sides. Linear regression evaluated gestational age as a predictor of tract volume, ADC, and fractional anisotropy.  Results:   Twenty-four cases were excluded due to low-quality reconstructions. Fifty-eight fetuses with a median gestational age of 30.6 weeks (interquartile range, 7 weeks) were analyzed. The superior cerebellar peduncle was identified in 39 subjects (69%), and it was symmetric in 15 (38%). The middle cerebellar peduncle was identified in all subjects and appeared symmetric; in 13 subjects (22%), two distinct subcomponents were identified. The inferior cerebellar peduncle was not found in any subject. There was a significant increase in volume for the superior cerebellar peduncle and middle cerebellar peduncle (both, P < .05), an increase in fractional anisotropy (both, P < .001), and a decrease in ADC (both, P < .001) with gestational age. The middle cerebellar peduncle had higher volume (P < .001) and fractional anisotropy (P = .002) and lower ADC (P < .001) than the superior cerebellar peduncle after controlling for gestational age.

Our purpose was to determine whether the use of CTP-derived time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function maps improves diagnostic performance for detecting these occlusions.  Materials and methods:   Seventy consecutive patients with a distal arterial occlusion and 70 randomly selected controls who underwent multimodal CT with CTA and CTP for a suspected acute ischemic stroke were included in this retrospective study. Four readers with different levels of experience independently read the CTAs in 2 separate sessions, with and without time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function maps, recording the presence or absence of an occlusion, diagnostic confidence, and interpretation time. Accuracy for detecting distal occlusions was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis, and areas under curves were compared to assess whether accuracy improved with use of time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function. Changes in diagnostic confidence and interpretation time were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   Mean sensitivity for detecting occlusions on CTA increased from 70.7% to 90.4% with use of time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function maps. Diagnostic accuracy improved significantly for the 4 readers (P < .001), with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves increasing by 0.186, 0.136, 0.114, and 0.121, respectively. Diagnostic confidence and speed also significantly increased.  Conclusions:   All assessed metrics of diagnostic performance for detecting distal arterial occlusions improved with the use of time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function maps, encouraging their use to aid in interpretation of CTA by both experienced and inexperienced readers.

We examined the accuracy of CTP in discriminating epileptic seizures from acute ischemic stroke without identified arterial occlusion.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively identified consecutive patients in our emergency department who underwent CTP in the 4.5 hours following the development of an acute focal neurologic deficit who were discharged with a final diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or epileptic seizure.  Results:   Among 95 patients, the final diagnosis was epileptic seizure in 45 and acute ischemic stroke in 50. CTP findings were abnormal in 73% of the patients with epileptic seizure and 40% of those with acute ischemic stroke. Hyperperfusion was observed more frequently in the seizure group (36% versus 2% for acute ischemic stroke) with high specificity (98%) but low sensitivity (35%) for the diagnosis of epileptic seizure. Hypoperfusion was found in 38% of cases in each group and was not confined to a vascular territory in 24% of patients in the seizure group and 2% in the acute ischemic stroke group. The interobserver agreement was good (κ = 0.60) for hypo-, hyper-, and normoperfusion patterns and moderate (κ = 0.41) for the evaluation of vascular systematization.

Main outcome measures:   The development and time to onset of contralateral ocular and periocular metastasis, systemic metastasis, and death.  Results:   Of the 13 000 treated UM patients, 13 patients were diagnosed with UM metastasis to the contralateral ocular and periocular structures. Mean patient age at primary UM diagnosis was 60 years (median, 60 years; range, 37-87 years). The primary uveal melanoma was in the choroid (n = 11) or ciliary body (n = 2) and was treated with brachytherapy (n = 11), proton beam radiotherapy (n = 1), or enucleation (n = 1). Systemic metastasis developed in 11 patients (85%) at a mean of 66 months (median, 34 months; range, 12-216 months) after diagnosis of the primary UM. All 11 patients (100%) showed liver metastasis and 8 patients (62%) also showed extrahepatic metastasis. The sites of metastasis to the contralateral ocular or periocular structures included the choroid in 4 patients (31%), the orbit in 7 patients (54%), and the eyelid in 2 patients (15%). One patient with eyelid metastasis demonstrated concurrent conjunctival nodule. Mean time to diagnosis of contralateral ocular or periocular metastasis was 94 months (median, 48 months; range, 9-375 months). Contralateral choroidal metastasis was multifocal in 3 of 4 patients (75%). Of 7 patients with orbital metastasis, 5 showed extraocular muscle involvement with restricted ocular motility. Treatment for contralateral choroidal metastasis included brachytherapy (n = 2), transpupillary thermotherapy (n = 1), and observation (n = 1). Treatment for contralateral periocular (orbit or eyelid) metastasis was excision (n = 5), external beam radiotherapy (n = 2), and observation (n = 2). Of 13 patients, death was documented in 11 patients at a mean of 17 months (median, 9 months; range, 3-54 months) as a result of systemic UM metastasis (n = 10) or unrelated cause (n = 1).  Conclusions:   Metastasis resulting from UM to the contralateral ocular and periocular structures is rare and generally occurs in patients with disseminated metastasis. Orbital tissue is the most common site of involvement, and these patients have short life expectancy.""","""['Babak Masoomian', 'Arman Mashayekhi', 'Jerry A Shields', 'Carol L Shields']""","""[' Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ' Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

We compared cone-beam CT with multidetector CT to assess postoperative implant placement and delineate finer anatomic structures, image quality, and radiation dose used.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective multicenter study included 51 patients with cochlear implants and postoperative imaging via temporal bone cone-beam CT (n = 32 ears) or multidetector CT (n = 19 ears) between 2012 and 2017. We evaluated the visualization quality of single electrode contacts, the scalar position of the electrodes, cochlear walls, mastoid facial canal, metallic artifacts (using a 4-level visual score), and the ability to measure the insertion angle of the electrodes. The signal-to-noise ratio and radiation dose were also evaluated.  Results:   Cone-beam CT was more sensitive for visualizing the scalar position of the electrodes (P = .046), cochlear outer wall (P = .001), single electrode contacts (P < .001), and osseous spiral lamina (P = .004) and had fewer metallic artifacts (P < .001). However, there were no significant differences between both methods in visualization of the modiolus (P = .37), cochlear inner wall (P > .99), and mastoid facial canal wall (P = .07) and the ability to measure the insertion angle of the electrodes (P > .99). The conebeam CT group had significantly lower dose-length product (P < .001), but multidetector CT showed a higher signal-to-noise ratio in both bone and air (P = .22 and P = .001).  Conclusions:   Cone-beam CT in patients with cochlear implants provides images with higher spatial resolution and fewer metallic artifacts than multidetector CT at a relatively lower radiation dose.""","""['R A Helal', 'R Jacob', 'M A Elshinnawy', 'A I Othman', 'I M Al-Dhamari', 'D W Paulus', 'T T Abdelaziz']""","""[' From the Radiodiagnosis Department (R.A.H., M.A.E., A.I.O., T.T.A.), Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt raniahelal@med.asu.edu.eg.', ' HNOplus (R.J.), Höhr-Grenzhausen, Germany.', ' From the Radiodiagnosis Department (R.A.H., M.A.E., A.I.O., T.T.A.), Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', ' Institute for computational visualistics (I.M.A.-D., D.W.P.), Koblenz University, Koblenz, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""AJNR Am J Neuroradiol""","""['Radiohistologic Comparison Study of Temporal Bone Specimens After Cochlear Implant Electrode Array Insertion: Is Cone-Beam CT Superior to MDCT?', 'Visualization of Different Types of Cochlear Implants in Postoperative Cone-Beam CT Imaging.', 'Cone beam CT for perioperative imaging in hearing preservation Cochlear implantation - a human cadaveric study.', 'The application progress of cone beam computed tomography in cochlear implantation.', 'Progress of research on cone beam CT in cochlear implantation.', 'OPTIMISING THE PARAMETERS OF COCHLEAR IMPLANT IMAGING WITH CONE-BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY.', 'High-speed flat-detector computed tomography for temporal bone imaging and postoperative control of cochlear implants.', 'Measuring 3D Cochlear Duct Length on MRI: Is It Accurate and Reliable?']"""

Here we report the experience of cfDNA testing at the time of diagnosis and how this intervention can help avoid further invasive interventions, how it can be used to determine initiation of therapy, and how variation allele frequency of the somatic alteration affects response to subsequent treatment.  Patients and methods:   This is a single-institution retrospective study of patients with advanced NSCLC who had cfDNA from plasma tested using the Guardant360 panel, which identifies somatic genomic alterations by massive parallel sequencing of target genes. An institutional Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments tissue panel using fluorescence in situ hybridization (for MET, RET, ROS1, and ALK) and next-generation sequencing for selected genes was used for tissue analysis. Actionable mutations are those with US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies (EGFR, ALK, ROS, BRAF, NTRK fusions) or therapies soon to be approved (RET fusions and MET amplifications, or MET exon 14 skipping mutation).  Results:   A total of 163 blood samples from 143 patients were evaluated, 82 at diagnosis and 81 at disease progression. A total of 94 cases had tissue and cfDNA testing performed within 12 weeks of each other. Seventy-six (81%) of 94 cases were concordant, of which 22 cases were concordantly positive and 54 concordantly negative. Eighteen (19%) of 94 cases were discordant, of which 11 had negative blood and positive tissue results, and 7 had positive blood and negative tissue results. cfDNA testing had a sensitivity of 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51%, 83%), specificity of 89% (95% CI, 81%, 97%), negative predictive value of 83% (95% CI, 74%, 92%), and positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI, 60%, 91%). Nineteen (21%) of 82 cfDNA samples analyzed at diagnosis had actionable mutations identified (4 EGFR exon 19 deletion, 2 EGFR exon 21 L858R, 2 EGFR L861Q, 1 L861R, 4 EML4-ALK fusion, 2 CD74-ROS1 fusion, 2 MET exon 14 skipping mutation, 2 KIF5B-RET fusion). Of the 82 patients with cfDNA testing performed at the time of diagnosis, 8 patients (10%) initiated targeted therapy on the basis of cfDNA results only, with 6 patients experiencing partial response, 1 patient complete response, and 1 patient stable disease. The response rate for patients who initiated targeted therapies on the basis of cfDNA only at diagnosis was 88%. Variant allele frequency had no impact on response.  Conclusions:   Initiation of targeted therapy for advanced NSCLC was feasible based only on identification of actionable mutations by cfDNA testing in 9% of the cases for which tissue diagnosis could not be obtained. Actionable targets were identified by cfDNA in 20% of the samples sent at diagnosis. A substantial number of patients benefited from cfDNA testing at initial diagnosis because it identified actionable mutations that led to appropriate targeted treatments.""","""['Jean G Bustamante Alvarez', 'Sarah Janse', 'Dwight H Owen', 'Stephanie Kiourtsis', 'Erin M Bertino', 'Kai He', 'David P Carbone', 'Gregory A Otterson']""","""[' Arthur G.

Methods:   We classified eyes into four categories-pachydrusen, soft drusen, subretinal drusenoid deposit (SDD), and soft drusen with SDD-and compared the baseline mean macular GCIPL thickness according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid and its change between groups.  Results:   We classified 53, 29, 36, and 34 eyes into the four categories, respectively. The mean GCIPL thickness values in the 3-mm area were 82.61 ± 9.54 µm for the pachydrusen group, 79.11 ± 10.26 µm for the soft drusen group, 77.72 ± 6.04 µm for the SDD group, and 71.63 ± 8.69 µm for the soft drusen with SDD group (P < 0.001). The soft drusen with the SDD group showed a greater change in GCIPL thickness (-2.50 ± 0.29 µm/year) in the 3-mm area as compared with the pachydrusen group (-0.18 ± 0.35 µm/year), soft drusen group (-0.55 ± 0.36 µm/year), and SDD group (-0.55 ± 0.37) (all P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The GCIPL thickness varied according to the type of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration. The thinner baseline GCIPL and its greater change in eyes with soft drusen with SDD may suggest that these eyes are experiencing more prominent neuroretinal degeneration in the central 3-mm area than those in the other groups.""","""['Ki Tae Nam', 'Hyun Woo Chung', 'Sungmin Jang', 'Soon-Young Hwang', 'Seong-Woo Kim', 'Jaeryung Oh', 'Cheolmin Yun']""","""[' Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Saevit Eye Hospital, Goyang, Korea; and.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Retina""","""['Optical coherence tomography evidence of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thinning in eyes with subretinal drusenoid deposits.', 'Pachydrusen in Indian population: A hospital-based study.', 'SUBRETINAL DRUSENOID DEPOSIT IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: Histologic Insights Into Initiation, Progression to Atrophy, and Imaging.', 'Macular Thickness in Intermediate Age-Related Macular Degeneration Is Influenced by Disease Severity and Subretinal Drusenoid Deposit Presence.', 'FEATURES OF THE MACULAR AND PERIPAPILLARY CHOROID AND CHORIOCAPILLARIS IN EYES WITH NONEXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.', 'Clinical features associated with the atrophy of fellow eyes in patients with unilateral type 3 macular neovascularization.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective, comparative, nonrandomized study of 74 radiation maculopathy patients presenting macular lipid deposits, hemorrhages, microaneurysms, cystoid edema, nerve layer infarction, telangiectasia, or capillary nonperfusion. The study group included 52 consecutive patients injected with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (bevacizumab/ranibizumab: 46/6) every two months for the first and every 3 months for the second year, with minimum 12 months' follow-up. The control group consisted of 22 patients having declined this treatment. Best-corrected visual acuity, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography were recorded at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The foveal avascular zone and capillary density were measured at the superficial capillary plexus.  Results:   Radiation maculopathy was diagnosed at 2 years (1.5-3.5) after proton therapy.

Aim of this study was to analyze success and complication rates of these techniques in a large collective of patients in the daily clinical practice in a pre-endosonographic biliary drainage era.  Patients and methods:   Patients with altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy with biliary interventions between March 1st, 2006, and June 30th, 2014 in four tertiary endoscopic centers in Munich, Germany were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   At least one endoscopic-assisted biliary intervention was successful in 234/411 patients (56.9%)-in 192 patients in the first, in 34 patients in the second and in 8 patients in the third attempt. Success rates for Billroth-II/Whipple-/Roux-en-Y reconstruction were 70.5%/56.7%/49.5%. Complication rates for these reconstructions were 9.3%/6.5%/6.3%, the overall complication rate was 7.1%. Success rates were highest in patients with Billroth-II reconstruction where use of a duodenoscope was possible, complication rates were also highest in this scenario. Success rates were lowest in longer-limb anatomy like Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Percutaneous biliary drainages (PTBD) were inserted 268 times with substantially higher success (90.7%) as well as complication rates (11.6%) compared to the endoscopic approach. Compared to patients treated endoscopically, patients with PTBD had a lower performance status, more severe cholestasis and a significant higher rate of malignant underlying disease.  Conclusion:   In patients with altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy, success rates of endoscopic-assisted biliary interventions are lower compared to PTBD. Still, due to the beneficial complication rates of the endoscopic approach, this technique should be preferred whenever possible and in selected patients who still need to be defined in detail, repeated endoscopic attempts are useful to help achieve the desired result.""","""['Simon Nennstiel', 'Kathrin Freivogel', 'Alexander Faber', 'Christoph Schlag', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Martin Blöchinger', 'Markus Dollhopf', 'Björn Lewerenz', 'Wolfgang Schepp', 'Jörg Schirra', 'Roland M Schmid', 'Bruno Neu']""","""[' Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik Für Innere Medizin II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der TU München, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675, Munich, Germany. simon.nennstiel@mri.tum.de.', ' Innere Medizin I, Krankenhaus Barmherzige Brüder München, Romanstraße 93, 80639, Munich, Germany.', ' Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik Für Innere Medizin II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der TU München, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675, Munich, Germany.', ' Institut für Medizinische Informatik, Statistik und Epidemiologie, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der Technischen Universität München, Ismaninger Straße 22, 81675, Munich, Germany.', ' Klinik für Gastroenterologie und Hepatologie, München Klinik Neuperlach (München Klinik gGmbH), Oskar-Maria-Graf-Ring 51, 81737, Munich, Germany.', ' Klinik für Gastroenterologie, Hepatologie und Gastroenterologische Onkologie, München Klinik Bogenhausen (München Klinik gGmbH), Englschalkinger Straße 77, 81925, Munich, Germany.', ' Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universität München Standort Großhadern, Marchioninistraße 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', ' Medizinische Klinik II, Krankenhaus Landshut-Achdorf, Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus der TU München, Achdorferweg 3, 84036, Landshut, Germany.']""","""2021""","""2021 Dec""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Analysis of the factors involved in procedural failure: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography using a short-type single-balloon enteroscope for patients with surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy.', 'Endoscopic drainage of obstructed biliary system in altered gastrointestinal anatomy: An experience from a tertiary center in India.', 'EUS-guided biliary interventions for benign diseases and unsuccessful ERCP - a prospective unicenter feasibility study on a large consecutive patient cohort.', 'Status of single-balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with surgically altered anatomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis on biliary interventions.', 'Improved techniques for double-balloon-enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.', 'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients after bilioenteric anstomosis.', 'Comparison between Enteroscopy-, Laparoscopy- and Endoscopic Ultrasound-Assisted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography in Patients with Surgically Altered Anatomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Treatments include dietary and behavioral changes, as well as pharmacotherapy and revision surgery. All can be costly or hard to adhere to. In recent years, evidence accumulates in favor of endoscopic trans-oral outlet reduction (TORe) as an effective treatment for DS, targeting the pathophysiology of rapid gastric clearance. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of TORe for DS in a single referral center.  Methods:   Patients after bariatric surgery suffering DS were followed, and data were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis and post-procedural assessment of DS were made clinically using Sigstad score. During the procedure, the anastomotic rim was cauterized. Afterwards, 2 non-interrupted ""8-figure"" sutures were placed, resulting in imbrication of additional gastric tissue on top of the anastomosis and narrowing to <1 cm at the end of the procedure. Patients were instructed to keep a liquid diet for 14 days and follow-up continued for 6 months.  Results:   Between 8/2018 and 9/2019 TORe was carried out in 13 patients (M:F = 3:10) with mean age of 45.1 (range 25-56) and BMI of 33.5 (range 28.1-40.3). Average time since recent surgery was 5.5 years (range 1-9). Mean pre-procedure anastomosis diameter was 25.2 mm (range 15-30) and was reduced to a mean of 5.6 mm (range 5-10). Three patients (23%) were admitted overnight due to inability to drink which resolved spontaneously. No major complications were reported. At 6 months, the Sigstad score was significantly reduced (19.4 ± 3.6 vs 5.2 ± 5.5, P < 0.001), and 11/13 (85%) of patients had a complete resolution of their dumping symptoms. In addition, BMI decreased by a mean of 2.3 kg/m2 (-1 to 7.5, p = 0.002).

Furthermore, the quality of life (QOL) of patients with a heavy cardiac load deteriorates. In this study, changes in a heart failure marker and symptoms of cases with a giant PEH from before to after laparoscopic surgery were examined.  Methods:   Levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a heart failure marker were measured before and after radical laparoscopic surgery in cases of type III, IV type of giant PEH. Changes of the symptoms due to heart failure were also investigated.  Results:   A total of 75 hiatal hernia surgeries were performed in 2012-2019. Of them, 50 had a giant PEH, and 20 (40.0%) had heart failure symptoms such as fatigue and exertional dyspnea. In the giant PEH cases, BNP could be measured before and after surgery to evaluate the presence of heart failure in 23 cases; postoperative BNP levels decreased from the preoperative values in 18 of them. Furthermore, in many cases, chest symptoms also improved.  Conclusions:   Radical laparoscopic surgery can reduce heart failure due to giant PEH.

Methods:   A retrospective, consecutive case series was conducted of patients managed at Associated Retinal Consultants P.C. from January 2013 to December 2019. Patients were identified as having had endophthalmitis by ICD-9/10 codes. Those with endophthalmitis and/or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment not managed at Associated Retinal Consultants from January were excluded.  Results:   Charts of 413 patients were reviewed and 19 met inclusion criteria. Incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment following infectious endophthalmitis was 4.6%. The most common inciting events for endophthalmitis was intravitreal injection (9 of 19) and cataract surgery (7 of 19). Fifteen of 19 patients were treated with an injection of intravitreal antibiotics and 4 underwent immediate vitrectomy with antibiotic injection. Biopsy cultures were obtained in 18 of 19 patients and yielded positive growth in 12 (66.7%). Seventeen of the 19 eyes were operable. Final retinal reattachment rate was 88.2% (15 of 17). Mean final logMAR visual acuity was 1.58 (Snellen 20/765). Factors associated with worse final visual acuity after surgical repair included preceding intravitreal injection (P = 0.001), streptococcus species (P = 0.024), presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (P = 0.015), and use of silicone oil during primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair (P = 0.010).

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 193 patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment who underwent either lens-sparing vitrectomy (n = 111) or phacovitrectomy (n = 82). Patients were operated by two experienced surgeons or eight vitreoretinal fellows and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Anatomical success rate, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes were compared.  Results:   Primary anatomical success rate was 92.8% (103/111) for lens-sparing vitrectomy and 91.5% (75/82) for phacovitrectomy (P = 0.733). The fellows had lower success rate after phacovitrectomy compared with the experts, but not statistically significant (85% [34/40] vs. 97.6% [41/42], P = 0.054). During phacovitrectomy, one zonulysis case in the experts group and four posterior capsular rupture cases in the fellows group were noted.

Methods:   Retrospective, comparative, consecutive study of 154 eyes; Group 1 underwent phacovitrectomy (n: 70), Group 2 underwent vitrectomy with subsequent cataract surgery (n: 41), and Group 3 underwent cataract surgery alone (n: 43).  Results:   No difference in the mean absolute error was found between Group 2 (0.41 ± 0.56) and Group 3 (0.41 ± 0.29); both were superior to Group 1 (0.74 ± 0.57). Between Group 1 and Group 2, no statistically significant difference in the mean absolute error was found between macula-on subgroups (P = 0.057), but this was statistically significant between macula-off subgroups (P = 0.009).

We hypothesised that preoperative biologic use in Crohn's disease is not associated with postoperative complications after ileocolic resection.  Methods:   Crohn's disease patients who underwent ileocolic resection over 2009-2019 were identified at a large regional health system. Preoperative biologic use within 12 weeks of surgery was categorised as no biologic, anti-tumour necrosis factor, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab. The primary endpoint was 90-day intra-abdominal septic complication. Risk factors included preoperative medical therapies, demographics, disease characteristics, laboratory values, and surgical approach. Regression models assessed the association of biologic use with intra-abdominal septic complication.  Results:   A total of 815 Crohn's disease patients who underwent an ileocolic resection were included [62% no biologic, 31.4% anti-tumour necrosis factor, 3.9% vedolizumab, 2.6% ustekinumab].

The 90-day postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis rate of 810 patients was 12%, abscess rate was 9.6%, and anastomotic leak rate was 3.2%. Multivariable regression modelling controlling for confounding variables demonstrated that preoperative biologic use with anti-tumour necrosis factor [p = 0.21], vedolizumab [p = 0.17], or ustekinumab [p = 0.52] was not significantly associated with intra-abdominal septic complication.

Our aim was to study the accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT) and its semiquantitative parameters for the detection of RS and the impact on overall survival (OS).  Materials and methods:   Eighty patients with histologically proven CLL were retrospectively included. PET/CT images were qualitatively and semiquantitatively examined by estimating the maximum standardized uptake value body weight (SUVbw), lean body mass (SUVlbm), body surface area (SUVbsa), lesion-to-blood-pool SUV ratio (L-BP SUV R), lesion-to-liver SUV ratio (L-L SUV R), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and comparing them with the main clinical-histologic variables. OS curves were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Seventy-eight patients had positive 2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT, whereas the remaining 2 were not FDG-avid. All PET/CT metabolic parameters were significantly higher in the RS group compared with the no-RS group, except for MTV and TLG. The best thresholds identified were 9 for SUVbw, 5.3 for SUVlbm, 1.7 for SUVbsa, 2 for L-L SUV R, and 4.8 for L-BP SUV R. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 24 patients died; OS was significantly shorter in patients with RS than patients without RS (16.5 vs. 27.8 months; P = .001). Binet-stage, B symptoms, SUVbw, SUVlbm, SUVbsa, L-L SUV R, and L-BP SUV R were shown to be independent prognostic features.

The patients were divided into two groups: the combination group (58 cases), which received concurrent icotinib, pemetrexed, and platinum treatment, and the sequential group (213 cases), which received the sequential pemetrexed and platinum therapy, followed by icotinib treatment. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS on the subsequent line of therapy (PFS2). PFS in the combination group was significantly higher compared with that in the sequential group (16.89 months vs. 9.90 months; p < 0.001). PFS in the combination group was also significantly higher than PFS2 in the sequential group (16.89 months vs. 14.05 months; p = 0.009). The overall survival (OS) of the patients was 33.22 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.99-37.01) in the combination group and 26.47 months (95% CI: 25.05-26.95) in the sequential group (p < 0.001). The combination group's objective response rate was superior to that of the sequential group (79.31% vs. 52.11%; p < 0.001). Propensity score matching also revealed that icotinib therapy combined with chemotherapy extended the PFS, PFS2, and OS of the patients (p < 0.0001, p = 0.003, and p = 0.001, respectively). The combination group's objective response rate was also better compared with the sequential group (79.31% vs. 51.72%; p = 0.001). In conclusion, our study demonstrated icotinib combined with chemotherapy can improve survival efficacy better than the separated two-line therapy. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? For advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutants, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first-line treatment. Unfortunately, most patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations acquire EGFR-TKI resistance after EGFR-TKI treatment for about 10-14 months. Studies have indicated that chemotherapy plus EGFR-TKIs may have combined effects on the growth of NSCLC cells. However, until now, there has been no study comparing the concurrent and sequential EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of concurrent versus sequential icotinib and chemotherapy in untreated NSCLC with sensitive EGFR mutations. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? In the patients with NSCLC with sensitive EGFR mutations, the first-line pemetrexed plus platinum combined with icotinib better improved PFS, PFS2, and objective response rate compared with first-line icotinib and second-line pemetrexed plus platinum. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? The results of this paper provide guidance for the strategy choice in the treatment of patients with NSCLC.""","""['Yun Zhang', 'Jing Wang', 'Zhuang Yu', 'Hong Ge', 'Lin-Wei Zhang', 'Ling-Xin Feng']""","""[' Department of Ultrasound, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, China.', ' Department of Oncology, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, China.', "" Department of Oncology, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, Shandong, China.""]""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""Clin Transl Sci""","""['First-line treatment of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.', 'First-line icotinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy for patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma (CONVINCE): a phase 3, open-label, randomized study.', 'Randomized phase II study of concurrent versus sequential alternating gefitinib and chemotherapy in previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutations: NEJ005/TCOG0902.', 'Impact of EGFR inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer on progression-free and overall survival: a meta-analysis.', 'First-line treatment of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Ultrasensitive response explains the benefit of combination chemotherapy despite drug antagonism.', 'Sequential chemotherapy and icotinib as first-line treatment for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Evaluating the Efficacy of EGFR-TKIs Combined With Radiotherapy in Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients With EGFR Mutation: A Retrospective Study.', 'Icotinib alone or with bevacizumab as first-line therapy in Chinese patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and activating EGFR mutations: A retrospective study.']"""

Methods:   Patients who underwent reduced-fluence PDT for refractory type 1 neovascularization, which showed persistent subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid after three or more consecutive anti-VEGF treatments, and were followed up for ≥24 months were reviewed.  Results:   Seventy-eight eyes of 78 patients were included, and 37 (47%) were classified as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The mean number of anti-VEGF injections before rescue PDT was 8.5 ± 5.4, and the mean follow-up period after rescue PDT was 74.0 ± 29.4 months. At 3 months after rescue PDT, exudation completely resolved in 55 (71%) patients and vision significantly improved (p = 0.021). Resolution of exudation was associated with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability [odds ratio (OR), 3.82; p = 0.031] and lower maximal height of pigment epithelial detachment (OR, 0.69; p = 0.018). In these patients, exudation recurred in 49 (89%) after mean period of 13.5 months. Vision significantly worsened at 24 months after rescue PDT, and thereafter, and the vision decrease was more prominent in patients with PCV. Rescue PDT could be repeated for recurrent or persistent exudation without increasing the risk of complications.  Conclusion:   In patients with type 1 neovascularization refractory to anti-VEGF, reduced-fluence PDT is an effective and safe rescue treatment.

Design:   Non-randomised retrospective study.  Setting:   1519 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between 2015 and 2018 were analysed according vocal fold mobility; UVFP patients were treated either by VT or SES.  Participants:   51 UVFP patients.  Main outcome measures:   51 UVFP patients have been advised regarding treatment options like either VT (group 1) or SES (group 2). The patients of group 1 (n = 26) and 2 (n = 25) were re-assessed up to 3 months post-operatively regarding UVFP persistence/recovery and perceptive voice sound quality. At follow-ups, perceptual analysis of voice sound (using roughness=R/breathiness=B/hoarseness=H scale) and endoscopic laryngoscopy have been performed. Position of immobile vocal fold, shape of glottal closure and RBH parameters have been considered for statistical analyses.  Results:   Restitution of UVFP with regular respiratory vocal fold mobility of both vocal folds occurred in 53.8% of group 1 (VT), and in 40.0% of group 2 (SES) after 3 months of therapy between both groups. No difference could be seen for RBH, type of glottal closure and position of ailing vocal folds in patients with persisting UVFP within both groups and between the groups.  Conclusions:   The study reveals that SES can achieve similar functional outcome in early UVFP.

Our purpose was to report multicenter clinical results of endovascular recanalization for medically refractory, nonacute, intracranial ICA occlusion and to propose a new angiographic classification to explore which subgroups of patients are most amenable to this treatment.  Materials and methods:   From January 2015 to December 2019, thirty-six consecutive patients who underwent endovascular recanalization for refractory, nonacute, atherosclerotic intracranial ICA occlusion at 3 stroke centers were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into 3 types according to an angiographic classification. Rates of technical success, periprocedural complications, and any stroke or death within 30 days along with follow-up results were evaluated.  Results:   The overall technical success rate was 80.6% (29/36), and the rate of any stroke or death within 30 days was 16.7% (6/36). The recanalization success rate gradually decreased from type I to type III in the 3 classification groups (92.9%, 81.3%, and 50%, P = .038), and the opposite was true of the perioperative complication rates (7.1%, 18.8%, and 50%, P = .038). Type I lesions showed favorable recanalization effects, 92.9% technical success rates, and 7.1% perioperative complications.  Conclusions:   Endovascular recanalization for nonacute atherosclerotic intracranial ICA occlusion is technically feasible, especially in patients with type I lesions, and could offer an alternative option for patients with recurrent ischemic symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy.

Increased NCCT utilization in busy hospitals may limit timely identification of ICH. RAPID ICH is an automated hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network application designed to detect ICH that may allow for expedited ICH diagnosis. We determined the accuracy of RAPID ICH for ICH detection and ICH volumetric quantification on NCCT.  Materials and methods:   NCCT scans were evaluated for ICH by RAPID ICH. Consensus detection of ICH by 3 neuroradiology experts was used as the criterion standard for RAPID ICH comparison. ICH volume was also automatically determined by RAPID ICH in patients with intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage and compared with manually segmented ICH volumes by a single neuroradiology expert. ICH detection accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratios by RAPID ICH were determined.  Results:   We included 308 studies. RAPID ICH correctly identified 151/158 ICH cases and 143/150 ICH-negative cases, which resulted in high sensitivity (0.956, CI: 0.911-0.978), specificity (0.953, CI: 0.907-0.977), positive predictive value (0.956, CI: 0.911-0.978), and negative predictive value (0.953, CI: 0.907-0.977) for ICH detection. The positive likelihood ratio (20.479, CI 9.928-42.245) and negative likelihood ratio (0.046, CI 0.023-0.096) for ICH detection were similarly favorable. RAPID ICH volumetric quantification for intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages strongly correlated with expert manual segmentation (correlation coefficient r = 0.983); the median absolute error was 3 mL.

It is essential to reduce the amount of contrast used for detecting the vessels distal to the occlusion site because acute ischemic stroke patients tend to have chronic kidney disease and patients with severe chronic kidney disease are at an increased risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury. We assessed whether vessels distal to the occlusion site during acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion could be visualized on angiographic images using flat panel detector CT acquired following intra-arterial diluted contrast injection, compared with MRA findings.  Materials and methods:   Between May 2019 and January 2020, we enrolled 28 consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusions of the anterior circulation eligible for mechanical thrombectomy following MR imaging. The patients underwent CBV imaging using flat panel detector CT with an intra-arterial diluted contrast injection instead of intravenous injection. Flat panel detector CT angiographic images reconstructed from the same dataset were evaluated for image quality, collateral status of the MCA territory, and visualization of the vessels distal to the occlusion site. These findings were compared with MRA findings.  Results:   Twenty-two patients were retrospectively examined. Flat panel detector CT angiographic image quality in 20 patients (91%) was excellent or good. The distal portion of the occluded vessel segment was visualized in 14 patients (70%), while the proximal portion of the segment adjacent to the occluded vessel in 3 (15%) was visualized. No visualization was observed in only 1 patient (5%) with no collateral supply. Flat panel detector CT angiographic images were shown to evaluate vessels distal to the occlusion site more accurately than MRA.

Therefore, our aim was to systematically compare intrasession repeatability between repeated scans for 2D and three-dimensional (3D) OCTA metrics in quantifying retinal perfusion in eyes with diabetic macular edema.  Methods:   Diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema who had two consecutive OCTA imaging scans obtained during the same visit were retrospectively included. A previously validated algorithm was applied to OCTA volume data to measure the 3D vascular volume and perfusion density. Optical coherence tomography angiography en face images were also processed to obtain 2D perfusion density metrics.  Results:   Twenty patients (20 eyes) with diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema were included. The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.591 to 0.824 for 2D OCTA metrics and from 0.935 to 0.967 for 3D OCTA metrics. Therefore, compared with the 2D OCTA analysis, the intraclass correlation coefficients of the 3D OCTA analysis were higher (without overlapping of the 95% confidential intervals). Similarly, the coefficient of variation (ranging from 2.2 to 4.2 for 2D OCTA metrics and from 1.9 to 2.0 for 3D OCTA metrics) indicated that the 3D OCTA-based quantifications had the highest interscan intrasession agreements. Differences in interscan 2D OCTA metrics' values were associated with average macular volume.  Conclusion:   Three-dimensional OCTA metrics have higher values of intrasession repeatability, as compared with 2D OCTA metrics. The latter finding seems to be related to the high rate of segmentation errors occurring in diabetic macular edema eyes.""","""['Enrico Borrelli', 'Mariacristina Parravano', 'Eliana Costanzo', 'Riccardo Sacconi', 'Lea Querques', 'Flavia Pennisi', 'Daniele De Geronimo', 'Francesco Bandello', 'Giuseppe Querques']""","""[' Department of Ophthalmology, University Vita-Salute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; and.', ' IRCCS-Fondazione Bietti, Rome, Italy.']""","""2021""","""2021 Aug""","""Retina""","""['Diabetic macular ischemia.', 'OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY TO DETECT MACULAR CAPILLARY ISCHEMIA IN PATIENTS WITH INNER RETINAL CHANGES AFTER RESOLVED DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA.', 'SUSPENDED SCATTERING PARTICLES IN MOTION MAY INFLUENCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY VESSEL DENSITY METRICS IN EYES WITH DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA.', 'Macular vessels density in diabetic retinopathy: quantitative assessment using optical coherence tomography angiography.', 'Implication of Deep-Vascular-Layer Alteration Detected by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'Optical coherence tomography angiography for quantitative microvascular assessment in diabetic retinopathy: inter-device and intra-device agreement and correlation with clinical staging.', 'Diabetic macular ischemia.', 'Changes in Macular Perfusion After ILUVIEN® Intravitreal Implant for Diabetic Macular Edema: An OCTA Study.', 'Optical coherence tomography angiography in the management of diabetic retinopathy.', 'Volume rendered 3D OCTA assessment of macular ischemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and without diabetic retinopathy.']"""

Methods:   In this retrospective interventional case series, 23 eyes with FFK of 23 consecutive patients and 52 eyes of 52 healthy volunteers who visited our keratoconus outpatient clinic were enrolled. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the causal relationship between FFK diagnosis and each parameter.  Results:   When only SBT was used, the corneal stiffness parameter, stiffness parameter A1 (SP-A1) and the corneal velocity at first applanation were selected as explanatory variables, and sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were 82.9%, 86.9% and 0.938, respectively. When only AS-OCT parameters were used, the posterior corneal asymmetric component and central corneal thickness were selected, and the sensitivity, specificity and AUROC were 82.6%, 94.2% and 0.893, respectively. When parameters from both methods were used, SP-A1 and the posterior corneal asymmetry component derived from Fourier analysis were selected as explanatory variables, and sensitivity, specificity and AUROC were 91.30%, 90.38% and 0.947, respectively.

Methods:   Twelve eyes of 12 patients with MFS were included in this study. Preoperative MRI images were subsequently measured after marker implantation and imported into the MIMICS software for the 3-D reconstruction of a virtual model of an eyeball and a marker. The virtual eyeball model was designed according to the degree of retinoschisis, which was measured using optical coherence tomography preoperatively. A macular buckle was designed using a titanium stent, assisted by 3-D printing; furthermore, it was surgically placed in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. Visual acuity, axial length and anatomic outcomes were analysed pre- and postoperatively.  Results:   Macular schisis in all patients was completely resolved after the surgery without any postoperative complications. The mean postoperative best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) improved significantly from 1.21 to 0.92 during the 6-month follow-up period (p < 0.001) and reached 0.9 (p < 0.001) after 2 years. The axial length was significantly shortened during the 2 years postoperatively follow-up period (p < 0.01). The average axial lengths in all patients decreased from 30.62 mm preoperatively to 29.81 mm 1 month postoperatively and remained around 30.16 mm from 1 year after the surgery.  Conclusion:   The 3-D printing technique is useful to predict the indentation height and position of the macular buckle.

A 3 × 3 mm area centered on the fovea was scanned with optical coherence tomography angiography before and at 6 months after surgery. The center of foveal avascular zone and the center of foveal photoreceptors were detected by en-face optical coherence tomography angiography images and sequential optical coherence tomography B-sections in the macular region. The presence or absence of ectopic inner foveal layers was also evaluated.  Results:   The mean distance from the center of foveal photoreceptors to the center of foveal avascular zone was 111.7 ± 106.8 µm in eyes with preoperative ERM. This distance was significantly correlated with the preoperative central foveal thickness (r = 0.33, P = 0.0104).

Despite the improvement in mortality rate since the introduction of immunosuppression, long-term prognosis is still uncertain not only because of the disease activity but also due to treatment associated adverse effects. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been demonstrated as an inflammatory marker in multiple settings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic ability of the NLR in AAV patients.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all adult patients with AVV admitted to the Nephrology and Renal Transplantation Department of Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte from January 2006 to December 2019. NLR was calculated at admission. The outcomes measured were severe infection at 3 months and one-year mortality. The prognostic ability of the NLR was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A cut-off value was defined as that with the highest validity. All variables underwent univariate analysis to determine statistically significant factors that may have outcomes. Only variables which significantly differed were used in the multivariate analysis using the logistic regression method.  Results:   We registered 45 cases of AVV. The mean age at diagnosis was 67.5±12.1 years and 23 patients were male. The mean Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) at presentation was 26.0±10.4. Twenty-nine patients were ANCA-MPO positive, 7 ANCA-PR3 positive and 9 were considered negative ANCA vasculitis. At admission, mean serum creatinine (SCr) was 4.9±2.5mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 76.9±33.8mm/h, hemoglobin was 9.5±1.7g/dL, C-reactive protein was 13.2±5.8mg/dL and NLR was 8.5±6.8. Thirty-five patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, eight patients with rituximab for induction therapy. Twenty patients developed severe infection within the first three months after starting induction immunosuppression. In a multivariate analysis, older age (73.6±10.5 vs. 62.6±11.3, p=0.002, adjusted OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.01-1.16], p=0.035) and higher NLR (11.9±7.4 vs. 5.9±5.0, p=0.002, adjusted OR 1.14 [95% CI 1.01-1.29], p=0.035) were predictors of severe infection at 3 months. NLR ≥4.04 predicted severe infection at 3 months with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 52% and the AUROC curve was 0.0794 (95% CI 0.647-0.900). Nine patients died within the first year. Severe infection at 3 months was independently associated with mortality within the first year (OR 6.19 [95% CI 1.12-34.32], p=0.037).  Conclusions:   NLR at diagnosis was an independent predictor of severe infection within the first 3 months after immunosuppression start, and severe infection within the first three months was consequently correlated with one-year mortality. NLR is an easily calculated and low-cost laboratory inflammation biomarker and can prove useful in identifying AAV patients at risk of infection and poorer prognosis.""","""['José Agapito Fonseca', 'Joana Gameiro', 'Inês Duarte', 'Sofia Jorge', 'José António Lopes']""","""[' Division of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Department of Medicine.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the outcome data of 17 children with acute leukemia who underwent related haploidentical HSCT. Fifteen were in complete remission (CR) before HSCT: CR1-6, CR2-7, and CR3-2 and 2 were not in remission. Donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony stimulating factor. The conditioning was nonmyeloablative in 4 and myeloablative in 13. All received PTCy 50 mg/kg on days 3 and 4 as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis along with tacrolimus or cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. A median of 8.94 million of CD34+ cells/kg was infused.  Results:   All patients were engrafted for neutrophil and platelets, except 1 child with refractory acute myeloid leukemia disease who relapsed before engraftment. Five children relapsed (4 died and 1 child with CD20-positive leukemia is disease free after Rituximab therapy). There was 1 transplant-related mortality due to grade IV GVHD. Remaining 11 patients are in CR. Acute GVHD was seen in 4 patients. Of 4, 3 children later developed chronic GVHD and all are alive and disease free. Three of 4 children who received nonmyeloablative conditioning have relapsed. Overall survival is 70.5% and event-free survival is 64.7%. Median follow-up of all patients was 393 days.

Materials and methods:   A total of 415 (209 female) consecutive, clinical head CTs with radiographically normal findings from patients from birth through 20 years of age were retrospectively selected and subjected to automated segmentation. Brain volume, brain parenchymal fraction, brain radiodensity, and brain radiomass were assessed as a function of patient age. Statistical modeling and quantile regression were performed.  Results:   Brain volume increased from 400 cm3 at birth to 1350 cm3 at 20 years of age (>3-fold). Males had a slightly steeper growth trajectory than females, with approximately 8% difference in volume between the sexes established in the first few years of life. Brain parenchymal fraction was variable at younger than 2 years of age, stabilizing between 0.85 and 0.92 at 2-3 years of age. Brain mean radiodensity was lower at birth (24 HU) and increased through 3 years of age, after which it stabilized near 30 HU, an approximately 25% increase. The product of brain volume and mean brain radiodensity (radiomass), increased from 700 HU × mL at birth to 3900 HU × mL, a 5.6-fold increase, with approximately 5% difference between males and females at 20 years. Quantile regression enables a given metric to be interpreted relative to an age- and sex-matched peer group.  Conclusions:   Automated segmentation of clinical head CT images permitted the generation of a reference database for quantitative analysis of pediatric and adolescent brains.

We present a case series of 4 patients of longstanding CD with neurologic complications. Treatment strategies and challenges are discussed.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 4 cases of longstanding CD with complications of myelopathy or radiculopathy.  Results:   The average age at onset of complications was 28 years (range, 17-37). The average duration of CD was 23.75 years. Narrowing of the craniovertebral junction was seen in 3 patients, of which 2 had os odontoideum, and 1 had rotational malalignment at the atlantoaxial joint. One patient had disc desiccation with bulge and intramedullary signal changes in the cord at C3-4 level. Medical treatment was not satisfactory, but botulinum toxin was partly useful in all. One patient had sequelae of myelopathy and did recover partially after deep brain stimulation. Of the 2 patients who underwent surgical fixation with a fusion of the spine, one improved, and the other had no improvement due to irreversible cord damage. The overall outcome was satisfactory only in 2 patients.

Here, we compare the frequency of non-tumor-related uptake and tumor positivity with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7 in patients with primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Methods: This retrospective matched-pair comparison matched 160 18F-rhPSMA-7 with 160 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT studies for primary staging (n = 33) and biochemical recurrence (n = 127) according to clinical characteristics. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed all scans, first identifying all PET-positive lesions and then differentiating lesions suggestive of prostate cancer from those that were benign, on the basis of known pitfalls and ancillary information from CT. For each region, the SUVmax of the lesion with the highest PSMA ligand uptake was noted. Tumor positivity rates were determined, and SUVmax was compared separately for each tracer. Results:18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed 566 and 289 PSMA ligand-positive lesions, respectively. Of these, 379 and 100 lesions, equaling 67.0% and 34.6%, respectively, of all PSMA-positive lesions, were considered benign. The distribution of their etiology was similar (42%, 24%, and 25% with 18F-rhPSMA-7 vs. 32%, 24%, and 38% with 68Ga-PSMA-11 for ganglia, bone, and unspecific lymph nodes, respectively). All primary tumors were positive with both agents (n = 33 each), whereas slightly more metastatic lesions were observed with 68Ga-PSMA-11 in both disease stages (113 for 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 124 for 68Ga-PSMA-11). The SUVmax of 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 did not differ (P > 0.05) in local recurrence or primary prostate cancer; however, the tumor-to-bladder ratio was significantly higher with 18F-rhPSMA-7 (4.9 ± 5.3 vs. 2.2 ± 3.7, P = 0.02, for local recurrence; 9.8 ± 9.7 vs. 2.3 ± 2.6, P < 0.001, for primary prostate cancer). Conclusion: The tumor positivity rate was consistently high for 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7. Both tracers revealed a considerable number of areas of uptake that were reliably identified as benign by trained physicians making use of corresponding morphologic imaging and known PSMA pitfalls. These were more frequent with 18F-rhPSMA-7. However, the matched-pair comparison could have introduced a source of bias. Adequate reader training can allow physicians to differentiate benign uptake from disease and be able to benefit from the logistical and clinical advantages of 18F-rhPSMA-7.""","""['Markus Kroenke', 'Lilit Mirzoyan', 'Thomas Horn', 'Jan C Peeken', 'Alexander Wurzer', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Marcus Makowski', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Isabel Rauscher']""","""[' Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Institute of Radiation Medicine, Department of Radiation Sciences, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany; and.', ' Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich.

Methods:   A retrospective, non-randomized study of all patients with RK who underwent cataract surgery using IA at the UCHealth Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Refraction prediction error (RPE) for IA and Barrett TKNH was compared. General linear modelling accounting for the correlation between eyes was used to determine whether absolute RPE differed significantly between Barrett TKNH and IA. Outcome by number of RK cuts was also compared between the two methods.  Results:   Forty-seven eyes (31 patients) were included. The mean RPEs for Barrett TKNH and IA were 0.04 ± 0.92D and 0.01 ± 0.92D, respectively, neither was significantly different than zero (p = 0.77, p = 0.91). The median absolute RPEs were 0.50D and 0.48D, respectively (p = 0.70). The refractive outcome fell within ± 0.50D of prediction for 51.1% of eyes with Barrett TKNH and 55.3% with IA, and 80.8% were within ± 1.00D for both techniques. Mean absolute RPE increased with a higher number of RK cuts (grouped into < 8 cuts and ≥ 8 cuts) for both Barrett TKNH (0.35D and 0.74D, p = 0.008) and IA (0.30D and 0.80D, p = 0.0001).

However, risk factors for conversion to SC, especially preoperative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings that predict conversion to SC, have not been investigated in detail.  Methods:   A total of 290 patients with acute cholecystitis who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our hospital between November 2011 and March 2020 were included. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were reviewed, and preoperative clinical factors predicting conversion to SC were investigated.  Results:   Forty-three patients underwent SC, whereas the remaining 247 patients underwent total cholecystectomy. An American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or greater (p = 0.011), surgery on or after 9 days from symptom onset (p < 0.001), obscuration of the gallbladder wall around the neck on MRCP images (p = 0.010) and disruption of the common hepatic duct on MRCP images (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with conversion to SC.

Therefore, the early identification of PEP is highly desirable to assist with the health cost containment, the reduction in unnecessary admissions, earlier appropriate primary care, and intensive care for preventing progression of severe pancreatitis. This study aimed to establish a simplified predictive scoring system for PEP.  Methods:   Between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019, 3362 consecutive trans-papillary ERCP procedures were retrospectively analyzed. Significant risk factors were extracted by univariate, multivariate, and propensity score analyses, and the probability of PEP in the combinations of each factor were quantified using propensity score analysis. The results were internally validated using bootstrapping resampling.  Results:   In the scoring system with four stratifications using combinations of only five extracted risk factors, the very high-risk group showed 28.79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.30%-41.25%; P < 0.001) in the predicted incidence rate of PEP, and 9.09% (95% CI, 3.41%-18.74%; P < 0.001) in that of severe PEP; although the adjusted prevalence revealed 3.74% in PEP and 0.90% in severe PEP, respectively. The prediction model had an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89) and the optimism-corrected model as an internal validation had an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.86).

Method:   This retrospective study included 275 patients who underwent cholecystectomy in a 15-month span. Patients were divided into three groups (group 1: mild AC; group 2: moderate AC with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class ≤ 2 and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score ≤ 5; and group 3: moderate AC with ASA class ≥ 3, CCI score ≥ 6, or severe AC).

Results:   For group 1 patients, 77 (81%) were treated according to the TG18 and had a significantly higher successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) rate (100%), lower hospital cost ($1896 vs $2388), and shorter hospital stay (2.9 vs 8 days) than those whose treatment deviated from the TG18. For group 2 patients, 50 (67%) were treated according to the TG18 and had a significantly lower hospital cost ($1926 vs $2856), shorter hospital stay (3.9 vs 9.9 days), and lower complication rate (0% vs 12.5%).

Patient characteristics, investigation results and treatment outcomes were compared. 50 women were diagnosed with a TOA during the study period. Nineteen (38.0%) were treated with antibiotics (medical group) and thirty one (62.0%) were treated surgically on admission (early surgical group). The early surgical group was associated with a high success rate of 96.8% and the lowest risk of readmission within 12 months (16.1%). There was no significant difference in the length of stay between the early surgical and the successful medical group.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is an inflammatory mass that forms most commonly as a complication of untreated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Traditionally, TOAs are treated first with broad-spectrum intra-venous antibiotics, with surgical intervention considered after 72 h. It is not known whether early surgical intervention would be beneficial to patient outcomes compared to traditional management.What do the results of this study add? In this study, we have demonstrated a high success rate with early surgical management. Readmission rate was lowest in the early surgical group compared to the medical and late surgical group. This suggests that early surgical intervention may be beneficial, compared to the standard management of trialling antibiotics and then proceeding to surgery 72 h later.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

A postoperative MRD1 difference of less than 1.0 mm between the two eyes was regarded as MRD1 asymmetry resolution. The preoperative MRD1 difference was compared between subgroups with resolved or sustained MRD1 asymmetry. Astigmatism and amblyopia were also assessed.Results: Among 432 patients, MRD1 asymmetry was observed in 24 patients (5.6%). MRD1 was always lower in the side with more extensive epiblepharon. At 6 months after surgery, the mean MRD1 difference between the two eyes was significantly decreased (1.8 ± 0.7 mm to 0.5 ± 0.8 mm, p < .001, paired t-test) and MRD1 asymmetry resolution occurred in 19 patients (79%). In the resolved MRD1 asymmetry group, the preoperative MRD1 difference was 2.0 mm or less and was significantly smaller than that in the sustained MRD1 asymmetry group (p = .010, Mann-Whitney U test). Six patients had preoperative aniso-astigmatism ≥ 1.50 D. Unilateral amblyopia presented in nine patients (38%) and improved within 1 year postoperatively.Conclusions: MRD1 asymmetry can be resolved after epiblepharon surgery, especially when the preoperative MRD1 difference is 2.0 mm or less.

All patients received comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations as well as FAF imaging. The atrophic severity of each eye was identified based on the META-PM classification system, including no myopic retinal lesions (C0), tessellated fundus only (C1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (C3), and macular atrophy (C4).Results: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with 137 affected eyes were included. Four different autofluorescence (AF) patterns were detected: unremarkable AF (48 eyes in C1 and 18 eyes in C2, 48.2%), compound AF (2 eyes in C1 and 12 eyes in C2, 10.2%), patchy AF defect (5 eyes in C2 and 34 eyes in C3, 28.5%), and macular AF defect (18 eyes in C4, 13.1%). Moreover, AF patterns were significantly correlated with age (r = 0.419, P < .001), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (r = 0.592, P < .001), axial length (AL) (r = 0.529, P < .001), and subfovial choroidal thickness (SFCT) (r = -0.728, P < .001). In addition, with the help of FAF, 14.3% (5/35) of eyes initially categorized as C2 merely based on color fundus photographs (CFP) should be categorized as C3.Conclusions: The severity of FAF in eyes with MAM was significantly correlated with myopic characteristics.

Thus, an unbiased benchmarking dataset was built including selective and nonselective inhibitors for MAO-B compliant with both ligand- and structure-based virtual screening approaches. A retrospective and prospective mining scenario was applied to SPECS NP and DrugBank databases to detect novel scaffolds with potential benefits for Parkinson's disease patients. Out of the three best selected natural products, cardamomin showed excellently predicted drug-like properties, superior pharmacological profile, and specific interactions with MAO-B active site, indicating a potential selectivity over MAO-B. Two marketed drugs, fenamisal and monobenzone, were proposed as promising candidates repurposed for Parkinson's disease.

This study evaluates the correlation between PROs-specifically the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) and the Laryngopharangeal Reflux Symptom Index (LPR-RSI)-and the recently validated Esophageal Hypervigilance Anxiety Scale (EHAS). We hypothesize that patients with higher EHAS scores have significantly elevated GERD-HRQL LPR-RSI compared to those with normal scores. EHAS has been developed and validated in chronic esophageal disorders, but clinical impact is unknown. In this retrospective study, 197 patients (38% men, average age 56 ± 16) completed the following surveys:(1) EHAS, (2) GERD-HRQL, and (3) LPR-RSI. All patients referred for surgical evaluation of GERD completed the surveys as part of their pre-operative workup and post-operative follow-up In bivariate analysis, EHAS correlated with both GERD-HRQL (r 0.53, P = <0.001) and LPR-RSI (r 0.36, P = 0.009). Accounting for potential confounding with sex and age in multivariable linear regression models, a higher GERD-HRQL score (β 0.38; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.48; P = <0.001; Semipartial R2 0.20) and a higher LPR-RSI score (β 0.21; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.29; P = <0.001; Semipartial R2 0.08) were independently associated with higher EHAS.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with primary CNS germinomas who received short-course induction chemotherapy (2 cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 plus etoposide 40 or 100 mg/m2 for 5 days) followed by low-dose radiotherapy (dose: 2340 cGy) without a tumor bed boost. Disease-free survival and overall survival served as the main outcome measures.  Results:   Between February 2002 and June 2018, 24 patients (20 males and 4 females; median age: 14.1 y; age range: 7.9 to 21.2 y) with pathology-proven CNS germinomas were included. The median follow-up time was 106 months (range: 17 to 169 mo). Isolated and multifocal lesions were identified in 13 and 11 patients, respectively. Tumor location was as follows: pineal gland (n=17), suprasellar region (n=13), periventricular region (n=7), and basal ganglia (n=2). Five patients had increased levels (>5 mIU/mL) of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), whereas alpha-fetoprotein concentrations were within the reference range in all participants. A total of 16 patients achieved remission after induction chemotherapy. The complete response rates of patients with increased and normal β-hCG levels were 40.0% and 72.2%, respectively (P=0.208). Low-dose radiotherapy without a tumor bed boost was subsequently delivered to either the whole ventricle (n=16) or the whole brain (n=8), resulting in complete remission in all participants. Compared with patients without increased β-hCG levels, those with β-hCG-secreting germinomas had less favorable 5-year disease-free survival rates (100% vs. 60%, respectively, P=0.000115).  Conclusions:   Some children with primary CNS germinoma may benefit from short-course induction chemotherapy followed by low-dose radiotherapy to the whole ventricle without a tumor bed boost.

Methods:   A total of 78 patients with Flatt type IV radial polydactyly were included. The authors performed metacarpal osteotomy if the angulation of the metacarpophalangeal joint was not correctable by the intraoperative radial stress test. The authors measured the metacarpal deviation angle of the thumb in simple posteroanterior radiographs. The clinical outcomes were assessed using Japanese Society for Surgery of the Hand evaluation total score and the metacarpal deviation angle correction angle. These outcomes were compared between the patients who underwent metacarpal osteotomy and those who did not. Of the patients who did not undergo metacarpal osteotomy, the relationships between preoperative metacarpal deviation angle and the metacarpal deviation angle correction angle were formulated using segmented linear regression analysis.  Results:   There were no significant differences in the demographic features and the value of preoperative metacarpal deviation angle between the two groups. However, the metacarpal deviation angle correction angle and Japanese Society for Surgery of the Hand evaluation total score were significantly higher in the patients who underwent metacarpal osteotomy. The segmented linear regression analysis demonstrated a breakpoint, indicating that the soft-tissue procedure alone does not sufficiently correct the metacarpal deviation angle. For the postoperative metacarpal deviation angle to be 5 degrees, the preoperative metacarpal deviation angle was calculated as 10.8 degrees.  Conclusion:   If the preoperative metacarpal deviation angle is greater than 10.8 degrees, metacarpal osteotomy can be considered even in patients with correctable metacarpophalangeal joint by intraoperative radial stress test.

Materials and methods:   The records of high-risk PCa patients who were preoperatively staged through 68Ga PSMA PET-CT and who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with eLND either alone or as part of multimodal definitive therapy between August 2016 and November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgeons were not blinded to the results of the 68Ga PSMA PET-CT scan. Pathologic uptake was defined as any anomalous uptake which was not better explained by another cause and was suggestive of PCa. The reference standard for this study was the pathologic confirmation using a node-based analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for 68Ga PSMA PET-CT were calculated in a per-patient analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.  Results:   Seventeen patients met the selection criteria. Mean age was 63 years (range 44-77) and mean and median preoperative serum prostate specific antigen was 19.25 and 9 ng/ml (range 6-131), respectively. The most common pathologic Gleason score was 8 (52.9% of cases). Seven patients (41%) had positive surgical margins and were submitted to adjuvant radiotherapy. Mean number of per patient removed lymph-nodes was 13 (±2.19). 68Ga PSMA PET-CT showed findings compatible with lymph node metastases in 4/17 patients and with locally-confined disease in 13/17 patients. Following pathologic confirmation, the per-patient sensibility of the 68Ga PSMA PET-CT was calculated at 75% (1 false negative) and the specificity at 92.3% (1 false positive) for detection of lymph node metastasis on primary staging of high-risk PCa patients. Positive and negative predictive value were 75% and 92.3%, respectively; accuracy of the test was calculated at 88.2%. All patients were submitted to 68Ga PSMA PET-CT re-evaluation 6 months after surgery and tested negative for local, nodal, or distant recurrence of disease.  Conclusions:   68Ga PSMA PET-CT appears to have a high negative predictive value for local lymph node metastases in high-risk primary PCa when compared to pathologic findings of eLND.

However, accurate tumor size measurement is challenging in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before resection, due to treatment-induced fibrosis and tumor invasion beyond the grossly identified tumor area. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the tumor size and tumor volume measured on post-therapy computed tomography (CT) scans and the pathological measurement. Also, we investigated the correlation between these measurements and clinicopathological parameters and survival.  Materials and methods:   Retrospectively, we evaluated 343 patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant therapy, followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy and had pre-operative pancreatic protocol CT imaging. We measured the longest tumor diameter (RadL) and the radiological tumor volume (RadV) on the post-therapy CT scan, then we categorized RadL into four radiologic tumor stages (RTS) based on the current AJCC staging (8th edition) protocol and RadV based on the median. Pearson correlation or Spearman's coefficient (δ), T-test and ANOVA was used to test the correlation between the radiological and pathological measurement. Chi-square analysis was used to test the correlation with the tumor pathological response, lymph-node metastasis and margin status and Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard for survival analysis. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   As a continuous variable, RadL showed a positive linear correlation with the post-therapy pathologic tumor size in the overall patient population (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.72, P < 0.001) and RadV (δ: 0.63, p < 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between RadL and pathologic tumor size in patients with ypT0 and those with pathologic tumor size of ≤1.0 cm. Post-therapy RTS and RadV group correlated with ypT stage, tumor response grades using either CAP or MDA grading system, distance of superior mesenteric artery margin and tumor recurrence/metastasis.  Conclusion:   Although RadL tends to understage ypT in PDAC patients who had no radiologically detectable tumor or small tumors (RTS0 or RTS1), radiologic measurement of post-therapy tumor size may be used as a marker for the pathologic tumor staging and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy.""","""['Dongguang Wei', 'Mohamed M Zaid', 'Matthew H Katz', 'Laura R Prakash', 'Michael Kim', 'Ching-Wei D Tzeng', 'Jeffrey E Lee', 'Anshuman Agrawal', 'Asif Rashid', 'Hua Wang', 'Gauri Varadhachary', 'Robert A Wolff', 'Eric P Tamm', 'Priya R Bhosale', 'Anirban Maitra', 'Eugene J Koay', 'Huamin Wang']""","""[' Department of Anatomical Pathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas, Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Surgical Oncology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Texas MD Anderson, Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Anatomical Pathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA; Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD, Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ' Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas, Anderson Cancer Center, 515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

They provide a guideline for CCT use in mild head injuries, based on clinical parameters.Our study aims to evaluate the impact of PECARN rules on hospital admission and CCT rate in children with mild head injury.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, we investigated 729 children with mild head injury presenting in the pediatric emergency department between 2012 and 2016. We compared 2 groups, before and after implementation of PECARN criteria in clinical routine.  Results:   Of 729 included patients (417 male; 5.6 ± 4.8 years;) 380 were seen prior to implementation of the PECARN rules, compared to 349 patients afterwards. Overall admissions to the ward decreased significantly from 83.9% (n = 319) to 71.3% (n = 249) (P < 0.001), a 31.3% reduction. Calculated from all pediatric admissions, the rate of patients with mild head injury fell from 6.0% to 4.3% (P < 0.001).We recorded a nonsignificant decrease in the CCT rate, from 14.7% to 13.2% (P = 0.555).No readmissions were recorded.

The Basic Endoscopic Skills Training (BEST) box provides a low-cost solution by adapting the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) box for flexible endoscopic simulation. The BEST box consists of six endoscopic tasks with a 5-min time limit per task. This study aims to develop a scoring system for objective evaluation of user performance.  Methods:   A total of 165 participants were tested on the BEST box. Participants were divided into two groups: retrospective analysis (n = 100) and prospective analysis (n = 65). From the retrospective group, 55 individuals were also scored on the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills-Upper Endoscopy (GAGES-UE). Linear regression between user performance on BEST box and GAGES-UE was performed to develop the scoring system. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was used to determine a threshold score to help users appreciate their endoscopic expertise. Prospective scoring of 65 individuals was then performed using the formula developed (20 experts and 45 trainees).  Results:   The minimum and maximum possible scores are 30 and 110, respectively. Retrospective analysis showed that the scoring system was able to distinguish between experts and trainees (p < 0.001), correlated with GAGES-UE (p < 0.001), and had a reliability constant of r = 0.765 (p < 0.001). On prospective testing using the scoring system the expert group received a final average score of 92, whereas the average score for the trainee group was 61 (p < 0.001).

The subjects had a mean age of 46.9 ± 18.5 years, ranging from 5 to 89 years, and they were evaluated following categorization into age groups with five-year increments. Subjects whose best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 or better, with no history of ocular diseases, were included. Subjects with congenital CVD were excluded.Results: We found a negative correlation between age and the total number of correct answers in SPP-3 (Spearman's correlation coefficient, r = -0.5743; p < .0001). The total number of correct answers was the highest in subjects aged 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years (17.2 ± 0.9 [mean ±SD]). The total number of correct answers of these groups had significant differences from those in the 5-9 years age group and those aged >30 years (Dunn's post-hoc test: p < .0001). Among the 19 detection numerals in SPP-3, we found that the correct answer rates of six numerals decreased with aging, and the colors of the numerals and their backgrounds all located parallel to the tritanopic confusion line.Conclusions: Using SPP-3, we confirmed that aging influenced color vision, even in normal eyes with a good BCVA (20/20 or better). The total number of correct answers of SPP-3 was the highest in subjects aged 10-24 years and had already begun to decline in those in their 30s.""","""['Kazuo Ichikawa', 'Sho Yokoyama', 'Yoshiki Tanaka', 'Hideki Nakamura', 'R Theodore Smith', 'Shoko Tanabe']""","""[' Institute of Visual Science, Chukyo Eye Clinic, Nagoya, Japan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Japan Community Health care Organization Chukyo Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', ' Institute of Visual Science, Meito Eye Clinic, Nagoya, Japan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, New York Eye & Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Curr Eye Res""","""['Comparison of the standard pseudoisochromatic plates--Parts 1 and 2--As screening tests for congenital red-green color vision deficiencies.', 'Colour vision testing in young children with reduced visual acuity.', 'Evaluation of Kojima-Matsubara color vision test plates: validity in young children.', 'Standard Pseudoisochromatic Plates part 2.', 'Aviation-relevent epidemiology of color vision deficiency.', 'Age-related changes of color visual acuity in normal eyes.', 'Vision through Healthy Aging Eyes.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess a telecytology quality assurance (QA) process that we implemented in 2015.  Materials and methods:   Each month, a cytotechnologist randomly selected 3 telecytology fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cases from each cytopathologist on the FNA service that month. Data were recorded in a monthly worksheet and included onsite telecytology adequacy, final adequacy, concordance, onsite operator, cytopathologist, and reason for discrepancy, if present. The worksheet was reviewed monthly, discordant cases were re-examined, and feedback to cytologists was provided. For this study, worksheets from October 2015 to December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   The QA program captured 488 cases, representing 25% of total cases that utilized telecytology during the evaluation period (n = 1983). The telecytology onsite assessment was concordant with the final cytologic assessment in 84% (410 of 488) of cases. The majority of discordant cases (72 of 78, 92%) were the result of an ""Inadequate"" onsite telecytology assessment, but a final diagnosis was able to be rendered; 92% of these cases were attributed to diagnostic material being present in cytologic preparations not available during the onsite assessment. Nine telecytology onsite interpretation errors were identified, of which 7 were provided by cytopathologists with less than 2 years of experience.  Conclusions:   Most telecytology cases with onsite assessment errors were evaluated by cytopathologists with less than 2 years of practice experience; therefore, careful monitoring of new staff should be considered when developing a telecytology QA program.""","""['Diane M Green', 'Megan E Boivin', 'Rachael M Everts', 'Rebecca E Proskovec', 'Linda M Yaman', 'Danielle R Dunn', 'Karyn M Hallberg-Wallace', 'Chloe E Bissell', 'Jonathan D Marotti']""","""[' Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', ' Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.

Methods and materials:   Retrospective study including 122 PCa patients who attended our department between 2000 and 2007. Gene expression patterns were analyzed in 21 samples from 7 localized, 6 locally advanced, and 8 metastatic PCa patients using Illumina microarrays. Expression levels of 41 genes were validated by quantitative PCR in 101 independent PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify individual predictors of BCR. A risk score for predicting BCR including clinicopathological and gene expression variables was developed. Interaction networks were built by GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin.  Results:   A total of 37 patients developed BCR (36.6%) in a median follow-up of 120 months. Expression levels of 7,930 transcripts differed between clinically localized and locally advanced-metastatic PCa groups (FDR < 0.1). We found that expression of ASF1B and MCL1 as well as Gleason score, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and positive margins were independent prognostic factors of BCR. A risk score generated using these variables was able to discriminate between 2 groups of patients with a significantly different probability of BCR (HR 6.24; CI 3.23-12.4, P< 0.01), improving the individual discriminative performance of each of these variables on their own. Direct interactions between the 2 genes of the model were not found.  Conclusion:   Combination of gene expression patterns and clinicopathological variables in a robust, easy-to-use, and reliable classifier may contribute to improve PCa risk stratification.""","""['Albert Carrion', 'Mercedes Ingelmo-Torres', 'Juan José Lozano', 'Ruth Montalbo', ""Maurizio D'Anna"", 'Clàudia Mercader', 'Elena Velez', 'Maria José Ribal', 'Antonio Alcaraz', 'Lourdes Mengual']""","""["" Laboratory and Department of Urology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ' CIBERehd.

With the goal of minimizing pain, anxiety, and unneeded interventions in stable patients, we implemented the Pediatric PAUSE at our level 1 adult/level 2 pediatric trauma center. The Pediatric PAUSE is a brief protocol performed after the primary survey, which addresses Pain/Privacy, Anxiety/IV Access, Urinary Catheter/Rectal exam/Genital exam, Support from family or staff, and Explain to patient/Engage with PICU team. The aim was to assess whether performing the PAUSE interfered with timeliness of emergent imaging in pediatric patients and their disposition.  Methods:   We identified all patients aged 0 to 18 years evaluated as trauma activations at our institution after the Pediatric PAUSE was implemented (October 1, 2016-March 31, 2017) as well as 2 analogous 6-month pre-PAUSE periods. Patient demographics, time to imaging studies, and time to ED disposition were analyzed.  Results:   One hundred seventy-two patients met the study criteria, with a mean age of 10.9 years and mean injury severity score of 10.6. One hundred fifteen participants (68.5%) were transferred from other hospitals, and 101 (87.8%) had ≥1 imaging study performed before arrival. The Pediatric PAUSE was performed for 41 (25%) of 163 study participants. There was no difference in time to first imaging study in participants for whom the PAUSE was performed (18.4 vs 15.0 minutes, P = 0.09).

Methods:   In this retrospective study of female patients who underwent surgical resection for pathologic stage IA adenocarcinoma, patients with preoperative imaging were included for analysis if the consolidation-to-tumor ratio was 0.5 (solid-predominant ground-glass opacity [GGO]) to 1.0 (solid). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to estimate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Risk estimates were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   For all 357 patients sublobar resection demonstrated worse 5-year DFS compared with lobectomy (76.4% vs 67.9%, P = .05). Multivariable modeling showed worse DFS with sublobar resection (hazard ratio, 1.55; P = .06) and tumors ≥ 2 cm (hazard ratio, 2.32; P = .05). On radiologic evaluation the solid-predominant GGO group (n = 81) demonstrated a smaller solid component compared with the solid nodule group (n = 163; 1.49 cm vs. 1.84 cm, respectively; P < .001) yet comparable total size. The solid-predominant GGO group showed improved 5-year OS (90.8 vs 76.8, P = .01) and DFS (79.3 vs 67.2, P = .05) compared with the solid nodule group. Additionally the solid-predominant GGO group demonstrated equivalent OS (90.8% vs 90.8%, P = .93) and DFS (76.0% vs 81.7%, P = .60) with sublobar resection compared with lobectomy.  Conclusions:   In this report of female patients with stage IA adenocarcinoma, sublobar resection was associated with worse DFS compared with lobectomy in whole-group analysis.

Methods:   PRL3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 167 patients with CRC, 37 patients with no disease, and 26 patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). Phosphorylated Akt at serine 473 (p-Akt S473) expression was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry in mCRC patients.  Results:   High expression of PRL3 was correlated with CRC progression, and every one unit increase in PRL3 level contributed to an increase in the rate of death by 1%-1.7%. PRL3 expression was significantly higher in liver metastases compared with primary tumors and showed a significant positive correlation with the expression level of p-Akt S473.  Conclusion:   PRL3 expression levels associated with CRC progression and metastasis, and positively correlated with activated Akt level in mCRC.

However, diagnostic accuracy is largely lacking for radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical persistence (BCP; that is, persistently measurable prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy [RARP]). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of PSMA (i.e.,18F-DCFPyL or 68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT imaging in patients who experience BCP after RARP and to evaluate the sites of persistent disease on PSMA PET/CT. Methods: In total, 150 consecutive patients with BCP after RARP who underwent radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT imaging were retrospectively evaluated. BCP was defined as any detectable first serum PSA value after RARP (≥0.1 ng/mL) at least 6 wk after surgery, in the absence of an undetectable PSA value after RARP. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for the detection of metastases outside the prostatic fossa (≥miN1) on PSMA PET/CT. Results: PSMA PET/CT was performed at a median PSA value of 0.60 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.3-2.4) after a median of 6 mo (interquartile range, 4-10) after RARP. In total, 101 of 150 patients (67%) had lesions with PSMA expression on PET/CT, and 89 of 150 (59%) had lesions with increased PSMA expression sites outside the prostatic fossa. Moreover, 39 of 150 patients (26%) had PSMA-positive lesions outside the pelvis. On multivariable analysis, higher PSA values after RARP (P = 0.004) and positive pathologic lymph node status (P = 0.006) were independent predictors for ≥miN1. Conclusion: In the presence of BCP, a high proportion of patients already had disease metastatic to the pelvic lymph nodes or showed evidence of distant metastases, as indicated by PSMA PET/CT. Higher PSA levels after RARP and positive pathologic lymph node status were significantly associated with metastases outside the prostatic fossa. In patients with BCP, PSMA PET/CT imaging is warranted to guide salvage treatment strategies.""","""['Dennie Meijer', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Yves J L Bodar', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Wouter V Vogel', 'Jakko A Nieuwenhuijzen', 'N Harry Hendrikse', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager', 'André N Vis']""","""[' Department of Urology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, VU University, Prostate Cancer Network Netherlands, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; d.meijer2@amsterdamumc.nl.', ' Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Urology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, VU University, Prostate Cancer Network Netherlands, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Prostate Cancer Network Netherlands, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', ' Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam University Medical Center, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Gallium-68-prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) predicts complete biochemical response from radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative PSMA-PET/CT as a predictor of biochemical persistence and early recurrence following radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Is Associated with Improved Oncological Outcome in Men Treated with Salvage Radiation Therapy for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection level and pattern of positive lesions using PSMA PET/CT for staging prior to radiation therapy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Identifying Patients in Whom the Follow-Up Scheme after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Could Be Optimized in the First Year after Surgery: Reducing Healthcare Burden.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.', 'Predictors of Bone Metastases at 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (HSPC) Patients with Early Biochemical Recurrence or Persistence.', 'Targeting PSMA Revolutionizes the Role of Nuclear Medicine in Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Predicting early outcomes in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer using prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Design:   Retrospective analysis of FET cycles reported to SART CORS in 2014.  Methods:   Data from fresh IVF cycles with preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), linked to the first FET cycles, were collected from the 2014 SART CORS database for autologous and donor oocyte cycles. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing FET with euploid embryos (n = 4148). Demographic data including age, BMI, prior fertility, and etiology of infertility were collected from the retrieval cycle and analyzed. Patients with uterine anomalies, preimplantation genetic testing-mutation (PGT-M) for genetic diseases, gender selection, HLA determination, or systemic and immunologic disorders were excluded. The primary outcome measure was live birth (LB) rate. Potential confounders such as age, prior fertility, and maximum baseline FSH values were analyzed with regression models as indicated.  Results:   Though age, maximum baseline FSH, and infertility diagnosis were significantly different, LB was similar between patients undergoing autologous or donor oocyte FET cycles.

Methods:   We propose a fully automated method, where after preprocessing, FGT is segmented in T1-weighted, nonfat-saturated MRI. Incorporating an anatomy-driven prior probability for FGT and robust texture descriptors against intensity variations, our method effectively addresses major image processing challenges, including wide variations in breast anatomy and FGT appearance among individuals. Our framework then propagates this segmentation to dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI to quantify BPE within the segmented FGT regions. Axial and sagittal image data from 40 cancer-unaffected women were used to evaluate our proposed method vs a manually annotated reference standard.  Results:   High spatial correspondence was observed between the automatic and manual FGT segmentation (mean Dice similarity coefficient 81.14%). The FGT and BPE quantifications (denoted FGT% and BPE%) indicated high correlation (Pearson's r = 0.99 for both) between automatic and manual segmentations. Furthermore, the differences between the FGT% and BPE% quantified using automatic and manual segmentations were low (mean differences: -0.66 ± 2.91% for FGT% and -0.17 ± 1.03% for BPE%). When correlated with qualitative clinical BI-RADS ratings, the correlation coefficient for FGT% was still high (Spearman's ρ = 0.92), whereas that for BPE was lower (ρ = 0.65). Our proposed approach also performed significantly better than a previously validated method for sagittal breast MRI.  Conclusions:   Our method demonstrated accurate fully automated quantification of FGT and BPE in both sagittal and axial breast MRI. Our results also suggested the complexity of BPE assessment, demonstrating relatively low correlation between segmentation and clinical rating.""","""['Dong Wei', 'Nariman Jahani', 'Eric Cohen', 'Susan Weinstein', 'Meng-Kang Hsieh', 'Lauren Pantalone', 'Despina Kontos']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', ' Tencent Jarvis Lab, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518057, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Med Phys""","""['Fully Automatic Assessment of Background Parenchymal Enhancement on Breast MRI Using Machine-Learning Models.', 'Automated fibroglandular tissue segmentation in breast MRI using generative adversarial networks.', 'Fully Automated Convolutional Neural Network Method for Quantification of Breast MRI Fibroglandular Tissue and Background Parenchymal Enhancement.', 'Background parenchymal enhancement on breast MRI: A comprehensive review.', 'Evaluation of background parenchymal enhancement on breast MRI: a systematic review.', 'Artificial intelligence in breast cancer imaging: risk stratification, lesion detection and classification, treatment planning and prognosis-a narrative review.', 'Robustness Evaluation of a Deep Learning Model on Sagittal and Axial Breast DCE-MRIs to Predict Pathological Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.', 'A Concise Review on the Utilization of Abbreviated Protocol Breast MRI over Full Diagnostic Protocol in Breast Cancer Detection.']"""

This study aims to compare the midterm outcomes and complication rates in patients with unstable 31A2 fractures treated with two different lengths of nails.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective study including 123 pertrochanteric proximal femoral fractures 31A2 treated with Gamma3 nail® between January/2017 and January/2019. 19 patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 104 patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Two groups, Long Dynamic Gamma3 Nail (LGN) and Short Static Gamma3 Nail (SGN), with 52 patients each were compared. Mean age was 81 years (range 50-99), being 78% female. Preoperative variables included: age, medical comorbidities, mobility, anesthetic risk, associated fractures, hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Postoperatively, functional and radiological results, quality of life, hemoglobin and hematocrit concentration, transfusion requirements, mobility, and pain were evaluated. Additionally, perioperative complications were also analyzed, such as malunion, non-union, infection rates, cut-outs, and peri-implant fractures.  Results:   A correct radiological fracture reduction was obtained in 73% of the cases (73% SGN/74% LGN). Two patients in LGN group had intraoperative complications (greater trochanter fractures). 38% of the patients with LGN presented nail tip impaction upon the distal anterior femoral cortex, associated with anterior knee pain. Blood loss and operative time was statistically different between groups. Despite the previous, no differences in clinical outcomes and quality of life were found.  Conclusions:   The present study comparing two lengths of the Gamma3 Nail in 31A2 fractures showed no overall differences in clinical and radiological outcomes, and complication rates. However, the use of LGN was associated with a statistically significant higher blood loss and operative time, and a tendency for increased need for transfusion, and anterior knee pain and reoperation rate.

Materials and methods:   Fifty consecutive chronic anterior shoulder instability cases treated by arthroscopic labral repair were included. A single-loaded single-row technique was used in the first 25 consecutive shoulders, and a double-loaded single-row technique was used in the next 25 consecutive shoulders. The number of suture anchors was 4 in the shoulders that underwent single-loaded repair and 3 in the shoulders that underwent double-loaded repair. 42 shoulders (84.0%) followed up clinical outcomes were evaluated a minimum 2 years (mean 28.5 months; range 24-46) postoperatively. The postoperative labral repair integrity was evaluated by MDCT-arthrogram at a minimum 6 months postoperatively.  Results:   At the final follow-up, the average UCLA, ASES, Constant, Rowe score, VAS pain score, and VAS for instability scores improved significantly, to 33.05, 92.33, 89.05, 94.86, 0.90 and 0.52, respectively, in the single-loaded group and to 32.19, 90.10, 89.05, 94.52, 0.90, and 0.86, respectively, in the double-loaded group.

As the pathology of CM-1 and SM has become better understood, the traditional concepts have been challenged. The objective of this study was to investigate the minimum 5-year follow-up clinical outcomes of surgical treatment of patients with scoliosis associated with CM-1 and SM and to evaluate the necessity of neurosurgical intervention before corrective surgery.  Methods:   This retrospective study was performed from May 2009 to September 2014. We enrolled 35 patients with scoliosis associated with CM-1 and SM who were undergoing spinal correction surgery without neurosurgical intervention. During the surgery, spinal cord monitor and wake-up test were used. Preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up major curve coronary Cobb angle, correction rate, apical vertebral rotation (AVR), apical vertebral translation (AVT), thoracic kyphosis angle (T5-T12), lumbar lordosis angle (L1-S1) were analyzed on radiographs.  Results:   The mean follow-up period was 82.5 months. The preoperative and postoperative mean curve coronary Cobb angle was from 55.7 ± 7.5° to 20.1 ± 5.8°, correction rate was 63.9%, AVR from 2.8 ± 0.6° to 1.3 ± 0.5°, AVT from 5.1 ± 1.4 to 1.7 ± 0.7 cm, thoracic kyphosis angle from 18.7 ± 4.0° to 32.2 ± 2.7°, lumbar lordosis angle from 36.3 ± 4.1° to 43.8 ± 3.2°.

Materials and methods:   This is a retrospective case series of patients positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing with imaging-confirmed stroke treated within a large health care network in New York City and Long Island between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data collected retrospectively included complete blood counts and creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer levels.

Results:   Compared with patients with COVID-19 with outside-of-hospital stroke onset and milder or no COVID-19 symptoms (n = 45, 52.3%), patients with stroke already hospitalized for severe COVID-19 (n = 41, 47.7%) had significantly more frequent infarctions (95.1% versus 73.3%, P = .006), with multivascular distributions (56.4% versus 33.3%, P = .022) and associated hemorrhage (31.7% versus 4.4%, P = .001).

Good outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2.  Results:   Forty-four patients with adequate reperfusion were identified with median age 72 years; 64% were women. Each region showed infarct growth: white matter (median pre-EVT 7 cubic centimeters [cc], post-EVT 16 cc), cortex (4 cc, 15 cc), basal ganglia (2 cc, 4 cc), total (20 cc, 39 cc). In multivariable regression, total infarct growth independently decreased the odds of good outcome (odds ratio = .946, 95% CI = .897, .998). Further multivariable analyses for determinants of infarct growth identified female sex was associated with less total growth (β = -.294, P = .042), TICI 3 was associated with less white matter growth (β = -.277, P = .048) and cortical growth (β = -.335, P = .017), and both female sex (β = -.332, P = .015) and coronary disease (β = -.337, P = .015) were associated with less cortical growth.  Conclusions:   Infarct growth occurred despite adequate reperfusion, disproportionately in the cortex, and independently decreased the odds of good outcome. Infarct growth occurred while patients were hospitalized and may represent a therapeutic target. Potential determinants of region-specific infarct growth were identified that require confirmation in larger studies.""","""['Robert W Regenhardt', 'Mark R Etherton', 'Alvin S Das', 'Markus D Schirmer', 'Joshua A Hirsch', 'Christopher J Stapleton', 'Aman B Patel', 'Thabele M Leslie-Mazwi', 'Natalia S Rost']""","""[' Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ' Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""J Neuroimaging""","""['White Matter Acute Infarct Volume After Thrombectomy for Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke is Associated with Long Term Outcomes.', 'Decreases in Blood Pressure During Thrombectomy Are Associated With Larger Infarct Volumes and Worse Functional Outcome.', 'Association of Multiple Passes during Mechanical Thrombectomy with Incomplete Reperfusion and Lesion Growth.', 'Effects of Collateral Status on Infarct Distribution Following Endovascular Therapy in Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke.', 'Sex-specific differences in presentations and determinants of outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion stroke.', 'Imaging biomarkers for clinical applications in neuro-oncology: current status and future perspectives.', 'Infarct Evolution in Patients with Anterior Circulation Large-Vessel Occlusion Randomized to IV Alteplase and Endovascular Treatment versus Endovascular Treatment Alone.', 'Spoke-administered thrombolysis improves large vessel occlusion early recanalization: the real-world experience of a large academic hub-and-spoke telestroke network.', 'Brush sign and collateral supply as potential markers of large infarct growth after successful thrombectomy.', 'Direct to angio-suite large vessel occlusion transfers achieve faster arrival-to-puncture times and improved outcomes.']"""

However, effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been established. Purpose To evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes, gray matter volumes, and MRI findings in asymptomatic neonates with SDH compared with control neonates. Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis was conducted between 2003 and 2016 and was based on data from the University of North Carolina Early Brain Development Study. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 2 years of age by using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). All infants were imaged with 3.0-T MRI machines and were evaluated for SDH at baseline (neonates) and at ages 1 and 2 years. Volumetric MRI for brain segmentation was performed at ages 1 and 2 years. A secondary analysis was performed in neonates matched 1:1 with control neonates. Differences in categorical variables were measured by using the Fisher exact test, and the t test was used for continuous variables. Results A total of 311 neonates (mean gestational age ± standard deviation, 39.3 weeks ± 1.5), including 57 with SDH (mean gestational age, 39.5 weeks ± 1.2), were evaluated. The subgroup included 55 neonates with SDH (mean gestational age, 39.6 weeks ± 1.2) and 55 matched control neonates (mean gestational age, 39.7 weeks ± 1.2). Fifty-five of 57 neonates with SDH (97%; 95% CI: 92, 100) were delivered vaginally compared with 157 of 254 control neonates (62%, 95% CI: 56, 68; P < .001). Otherwise, there were no differences in perinatal, maternal, or obstetric parameters. There were no differences in composite MSEL scores (115 ± 15 and 109 ± 16 at 2 years, respectively; P = .05) or gray matter volumes between the neonatal SDH group and control neonates (730 cm3 ± 85 and 742 cm3 ± 76 at 2 years, respectively; P = .70). There was no evidence of rebleeding at follow-up MRI. Conclusion Neurodevelopmental scores and gray matter volumes at age 2 years did not differ between asymptomatic neonates with subdural hemorrhage and control neonates. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Carlos Zamora', 'Cassandra Sams', 'Emil A Cornea', 'Zhenhua Yuan', 'J Keith Smith', 'John H Gilmore']""","""["" From the Department of Radiology, Division of Neuroradiology (C.Z., J.K.S.); and Department of Psychiatry (E.A.C., Z.Y., J.H.G.), University of North Carolina School of Medicine, 2006 Old Clinic Building, CB# 7510, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7510; and Division of Pediatric Imaging, Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Hasbro Children's Hospital, Rhode Island Medical Imaging, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI (C.S.).""]""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Radiology""","""['Subdural hemorrhage rebleeding in abused children: frequency, associations and clinical presentation.', 'Birth-related subdural hemorrhage: prevalence and imaging morphology.', 'Intracranial hemorrhage in asymptomatic neonates: prevalence on MR images and relationship to obstetric and neonatal risk factors.', 'Correlation of lateral ventricular size and deep gray matter volume in MRI at term equivalent age with neurodevelopmental outcome at a corrected age of 24 months and with handedness in preterm infants.', 'Subdural hemorrhage, intradural hemorrhage and hypoxia in the pediatric and perinatal post mortem: are they related?

National HEMS guidelines advised that triage criteria be standardized for pediatric patients. A national report found pediatric HEMS associated with decreased mortality compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) but did not control for transport time. We hypothesized that the rate of HEMS has decreased nationally and the mortality risk for HEMS to be similar when adjusting for transport time compared with GEMS.  Methods:   The Pediatric Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2014-2016) was queried for patients younger than 16 years transported by HEMS or GEMS. A multivariable logistic regression was used.  Results:   From 25,647 patients, 4527 (17.7%) underwent HEMS. The rate of HEMS from scene decreased from 21.2% in 2014 to 18.2% in 2016. The rate of HEMS for minor trauma (Injury Severity Score <15) decreased from 14.9% in 2014 to 13.5% in 2016 and major trauma (Injury Severity Score > 15) from 38.4% in 2014 to 35.9% in 2016. After controlling for predictors of mortality and transport time, HEMS was associated with decreased risk of mortality for only those with major injuries transferred from scene (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.88; P = 0.01) compared with GEMS.  Conclusions:   The rate of HEMS in pediatric trauma has decreased. However, there is room for improvement as 14% of those with minor trauma are transported by HEMS. Given the similar risk of mortality compared with GEMS, further development of guidelines that avoid the unnecessary use of HEMS appears warranted. However, utilization of HEMS for transport of pediatric major trauma should continue.""","""['Ali Duffens', 'Areg Grigorian', 'Christian de Virgilio', 'Theresa Chin', 'Dennis Kim', 'Michael Lekawa', 'Sebastian D Schubl', 'Jeffry Nahmias']""","""[' From the Division of Trauma, Burns and Surgical Critical Care, Department of Surgery, University of California, Irvine, Orange.', ' Department of Surgery, Harbor-University of California, Los Angeles, Torrance, CA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Emerg Care""","""['Association between physician-staffed helicopter versus ground emergency medical services and mortality for pediatric trauma patients: A retrospective nationwide cohort study.', 'Outcomes after helicopter versus ground emergency medical services for major trauma--propensity score and instrumental variable analyses: a retrospective nationwide cohort study.', 'Helicopters and injured kids: Improved survival with scene air medical transport in the pediatric trauma population.', 'Helicopter emergency medical services for adults with major trauma.', 'Helicopter emergency medical services for adults with major trauma.', 'Tracheal Tube Misplacement after Emergency Intubation in Pediatric Trauma Patients: A Retrospective, Exploratory Study.']"""

We report experience with commercial blinatumomab and inotuzumab use at two North American pediatric oncology centers in children and adolescents/young adults with B-ALL.  Procedure:   Patients 0-25 years old treated with the CD19 × CD3 bispecific T cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab and/or the CD22 antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab from January 1, 2010, to June 1, 2018, were eligible. Disease status included relapsed B-ALL in second or greater relapse, primary chemotherapy-refractory B-ALL, or B-ALL complicated by severe infection precluding delivery of conventional chemotherapy.  Results:   We identified 27 patients who received blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab outside of clinical trials during the study period. Four of the 13 patients (31%) with relapsed disease achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission, and five patients (39%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In the 12 patients with primary chemorefractory B-ALL treated with immunotherapy, 11 (92%) achieved MRD-negative remission as assessed by flow cytometry; 10 patients (83%) underwent subsequent HSCT. Two patients with B-ALL in MRD-negative remission received blinatumomab due to severe infection and remained in remission after chemotherapy continuation.  Conclusions:   Blinatumomab and inotuzumab can induce deep remissions in patients with rrALL and facilitate subsequent HSCT or other cellular therapies. Blinatumomab can also serve as an effective bridging therapy during severe infection.

Because of significant clinical implications of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related OPSCC, immunohistochemistry for p16 as a surrogate marker for high-risk HPV is an important ancillary test. After our laboratory switched from CytoLyt to formalin fixative for FNA needle rinses generating cell block (CB) material, we investigated the impact of this protocol change on the accuracy of p16 results.  Materials and methods:   FNA specimens of head and neck lesions with p16 staining performed on CB, from 1 year before and after the implementation of formalin-fixed CB (FCB) were identified. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 expression was scored and compared to p16 status on corresponding surgical specimens.  Results:   There were no false-positive results with either fixative. CytoLyt-fixed CB (CCB) had 47% (7 of 15) false-negative cases, whereas FCB had none, with 100% diagnostic accuracy for p16-negative (n = 6) and p16-positive (n = 15) results. False-negative CCB showed 0% to 10% nuclear and 0% to 65% weak cytoplasmic staining, whereas true-positive CCB showed 10% to 85% nuclear and 35% to 90% cytoplasmic staining. p16-negative FCB showed 0% nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, and p16-positive FCB showed 30% to 100% moderate-strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Interobserver variability was greater with CCB.  Conclusions:   In our laboratory, formalin fixation of CB material improved the accuracy of p16 interpretation. Staining in FCB was also more robust than CCB, which showed weaker cytoplasmic and more focal nuclear staining.

In this article, we aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the imaging evolution during a short-term follow-up.  Materials and methods:   We identified and reviewed the clinical data, laboratory results, imaging findings, and outcomes for 8 critically ill patients with COVID-19 with acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy.  Results:   All patients demonstrated multiple areas of white matter changes in both cerebral hemispheres; 87.5% (7/8) of patients had a posterior predilection. Four patients (50%) had short-term follow-up imaging within a median of 17 days after the first MR imaging; they developed brain atrophy, and their white matter lesions evolved into necrotizing cystic cavitations. All (8/8) patients had inflammatory cytokine release syndrome as demonstrated by elevated interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels. Most (7/8; 87.5%) patients were on prolonged ventilator support (median, 44.5 days; interquartile range, 20.5 days). These patients had poor functional outcomes (6/8 [75%] patients were discharged with mRS 5) and high mortality (2/8, 25%).  Conclusions:   Critically ill patients with COVID-19 can develop acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy that evolves into cystic degeneration of white matter lesions with brain atrophy during a short period, which we dubbed virus-associated necrotizing disseminated acute leukoencephalopathy.

We developed a mathematical theory of FET assuming a linear forced expiratory flow-volume profile that terminates when expiratory flow falls below a defined detection threshold. FET is predicted to correlate negatively with both FEV1 and FVC if variations in the rate of lung emptying (relative to normal) among individuals in a population exceed variations in the amount of lung emptying. We retrospectively determined FET pre- and postmethacholine challenge in 1,241 patients (818 had normal lung function, 137 were obstructed, and 229 were restricted) and examined its relationships to spirometric and demographic variables in both hyperresponsive and normoresponsive individuals. Mean FET was 9.6 ± 2.2 s in the normal group, 12.3 ± 3.0 s in those with obstruction, and 8.8 ± 1.9 s in those with restriction. FET was inversely related to FEV1/FVC in all groups, negatively related to FEV1 in the obstructed patients, and positively related to FVC in both the normal and restricted patients. There was no relationship with methacholine responsiveness. Overall, our theory of the relationship between FET to the spirometric indices is supported by these findings and potentially explains how FET is affected by sex, age, smoking status, and possibly body mass index.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Forced expiratory time (FET) has long been felt to reflect important physiological information about lung function but exactly how has never been clear. Here, we use a model analysis to assess the contributions of airway narrowing versus airway closure to FET in a population of individuals and find support for the theory that FET correlates positively with FEV1 if the amounts of lung emptying over a forced expiration vary from predicted values more than variations in the rates of lung emptying, whereas the correlation is negative in the opposite case.""","""['Gwen S Skloot', ""Kieley L O'Connor-Chapman"", 'Clyde B Schechter', 'Daniel J Markley', 'Jason H T Bates']""","""[' The Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', ' Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', ' Department of Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""J Appl Physiol (1985)""","""['Spirometric and anthropometric determinants of forced expiratory time in a general population.', 'A Simple Measure to Assess Hyperinflation and Air Trapping: 1-Forced Expiratory Volume in Three Second / Forced Vital Capacity.', 'Feasibility and predicted equations of spirometry in Shenzhen preschool children.', 'Relationship between the baseline alveolar volume-to-total lung capacity ratio and airway responsiveness.', 'The Concave Shape of the Forced Expiratory Flow-Volume Curve in 3 Seconds Is a Practical Surrogate of FEV1/FVC for the Diagnosis of Airway Limitation in Inadequate Spirometry.']"""

PGD 3 patients had worse RV global longitudinal strain (P = .01), RV free wall strain (FWS) (P = .003), RV fractional area change (P = .005), E/e' (P = .01) and lateral e' velocity (P = .004) but not tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P = .61). RV FWS (AUROC 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.95) and lateral e' velocity (AUROC 0.87, 95% CI 0.68-1.00) best discriminated PGD 3 development and showed the strongest association with PGD 3 (RV FWS OR 3.87 [95% CI 1.59-9.43], P = .003; lateral e' velocity OR 0.10 [95% CI 0.01-0.70], P = .02).

The genomic classifier ThyroSeq (CBLPath/UPMC, Rye Brook, NY), a targeted next-generation sequencing technology, could classify ITC nodules as malignant and nonmalignant. We sought to characterize our institutional experience with ThyroSeq testing.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively identified all patients seen from January 2015 through November 2019 who had ITC nodules analyzed with ThyroSeq. Relevant clinical, pathologic, and resection data were reviewed.  Results:   Of the 133 cases identified, diagnostic categories included atypia (or follicular lesion) of undetermined significance) (n = 65 [48.9%]), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN) (n = 48 [36.1%]), and suspicious for Hürthle cell neoplasm (n = 20 [15.0%]). About half of the papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cases (n = 9 [56.3%]) and more than one-third of the noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) cases (n = 3/8 [37.5%]) were classified as SFN. Most patients (n = 87 [65.4%]) did not undergo resection; of these, 73 (83.9%) were negative for all molecular alterations. Of the 54 cases with molecular alterations, isolated RAS or RAS-like variants were most common (n = 35 [64.8%]); 9 (25.7%) were identified in PTC and 8 (22.9%) in NIFTP. NRAS was the most common alteration (n = 20 [37.0%]), followed by HRAS (n = 6 [11.1%]), which was mostly detected in NIFTP cases (n = 4 of 6 [66.7%]).

Voriconazole is widely used as prophylaxis and in the treatment of invasive fungal disease. However, the safety, pharmacokinetics, and optimal regimens of voriconazole are currently not well defined in cirrhotic patients.  Design:   Retrospective pharmacokinetics study.  Setting:   Two large, academic, tertiary-care medical center.  Patients:   Two hundred nineteen plasma trough concentrations (Cmin ) from 120 cirrhotic patients and 83 plasma concentrations from 11 non-cirrhotic patients were included.  Methods:   Data pertaining to voriconazole were collected retrospectively. A population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed and model-based simulation was used to optimize voriconazole dosage regimens.  Results:   Voriconazole-related adverse events (AEs) developed in 29 cirrhotic patients, and the threshold Cmin for AE was 5.12 mg/L. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination adequately described the data. The Child-Pugh class and body weight were the significant covariates in the final model. Voriconazole clearance in non-cirrhotic, Child-Pugh class A and B cirrhotic (CP-A/B) and Child-Pugh class C cirrhotic (CP-C) patients was 7.59, 1.86, and 0.93 L/hour, respectively. The central distribution volume and peripheral distribution volume was 100.8 and 55.2 L, respectively. The oral bioavailability was 91.6%. Model-based simulations showed that a loading dose regimen of 200 mg/12 hours intravenously or orally led to 65.0-75.7% of voriconazole Cmin in therapeutic range on day 1, and the appropriate maintenance dosage regimens were 75 mg/12 hours and 150 mg/24 hours intravenously or orally for CP-A/B patients, and 50 mg/12 hours and 100 mg/24 hours intravenously or orally for CP-C patients. The predicted probability of achieving the therapeutic target concentration for optimized regimens at steady-state was 66.8-72.3% for CP-A/B patients and 70.3-74.0% for CP-C patients.  Conclusions:   These results recommended that the halved loading dose regimens should be used, and voriconazole maintenance doses in cirrhotic patients should be reduced to one-fourth for CP-C patients and to one-third for CP-A/B patients compared to that for patients with normal liver function.""","""['Taotao Wang', 'Miao Yan', 'Dan Tang', 'Yuzhu Dong', 'Li Zhu', 'Qian Du', 'Dan Sun', 'Jianfeng Xing', 'Yalin Dong']""","""["" Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ' Department of Pharmacy, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ' School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', ' Department of Pharmacy, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.', "" Department of Infectious Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, China."", "" School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Pharmacotherapy""","""['Population pharmacokinetic model-guided optimization of intravenous voriconazole dosing regimens in critically ill patients with liver dysfunction.', 'A retrospective, multicenter study of voriconazole trough concentrations and safety in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis.', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring and safety of voriconazole therapy in patients with Child-Pugh class B and C cirrhosis: A multicenter study.', 'Population pharmacokinetics, safety and dosing optimization of voriconazole in patients with liver dysfunction: A prospective observational study.', 'Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology of Voriconazole: Role of Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling in Pharmacotherapy.', 'Population pharmacokinetics of voriconazole and initial dosage optimization in patients with talaromycosis.', 'Application of Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis to Characterize CYP2C19 Mediated Metabolic Mechanism of Voriconazole and Support Dose Optimization.']"""

Stimulant medications improve these problems, but their effect on growth, heart rate, and blood pressure (BP) are inadequately explored.  Procedure:   We retrospectively studied children with brain tumors treated at our institution that had data available for 1 year pre and 2 years on stimulant treatment. Tumor location, gender, radiation treatment (RT), age at RT, drug type, and hormone therapy were variables of interest.  Results:   We identified 65 children (35 males) that fulfilled eligibility criteria. Focal RT was utilized in 58; 11 additionally had whole brain RT; and seven received no RT. Thirty were treated for hypersomnia and inattention, eight for hypersomnia alone, and rest for inattention. Modafinil was the first drug in 18 (27.7%), and methylphenidate in the others. Forty-seven (72.3%), 45 (69.2%), and 49 (75.4%) were on thyroxine, cortisone, and growth hormones, respectively. There was no difference in pre- and post-stimulant body mass index (BMI), heart rate, and BP. There was also no difference between modafinil and methylphenidate groups. Rate of height acquisition slowed on stimulants (P = .0096). Thyroxine treatment correlated with increase in BMI after stimulants (P = .04). Younger age (P = .0003) and higher prestimulant BMI (P = .0063) correlated with increased heart rate on stimulants, while higher age at RT (P =.016) correlated with elevated systolic BP on stimulants. No associations were found with height acquisition and diastolic BP.  Conclusion:   Stimulants are well tolerated by children with brain tumors that are appropriately managed for endocrine deficiencies, but may reduce the trajectory of height attainment.""","""['Raja B Khan', 'Maha Bano', 'Fang Wang', 'Pan Haitao', 'Anthony Christensen', 'Jessica Smith', 'Andrea Simmons', 'Zsila S Sadighi']""","""["" Division of Neurology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ' Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee.', "" Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", "" Pharmaceutical Services, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ' Department of Neuro-Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Pediatr Blood Cancer""","""['Sex-Specific Long-Term Height and Body Mass Index Trajectories of Children Diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Treated with Stimulants.', 'Cardiovascular Effects of Stimulant and Non-Stimulant Medication for Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Trials of Methylphenidate, Amphetamines and Atomoxetine.', 'Predictors of weight loss in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder treated with stimulant medication.', 'Comparative effects of methylphenidate and mixed salts amphetamine on height and weight in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.', 'Effect of stimulants on height and weight: a review of the literature.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively compared the 30-day outcomes of patients who underwent CTO PCI at the Red Cross Hospital, Greece between January 2016 and June 2019 and underwent SDD versus non-SDD. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, urgent repeat target vessel revascularization, tamponade, and stroke.

Setting:   University Hospital, United States.  Methods:   Using an activity tracker, the number of steps taken during the postoperative hospital stay was recorded for 235 patients undergoing either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to either being informed about the devices' ability to record the number of steps taken or blinded to the purpose of the devices. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study sample, a t test was used to compare number of steps recorded between groups, and a multivariate regression model was used to examine the effect of age, sex, preoperative body mass index (BMI), types of surgery, and length of stay on number of steps recorded.  Results:   One hundred twenty-five patients (52.8%) were randomized to the blinded group while 111 (47.2%) were informed that the device would record the number of steps taken. There were no differences in the number of steps recorded between the 2 groups. Patients with prolonged length of stay recorded lower numbers of steps taken on postoperative day 0. Increasing age was seen to reduce the number of steps recorded on postoperative day number 1. There were no significant differences in number of steps recorded based on sex, preoperative BMI, or surgery type.

Design/methods:   Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Protocols 05-001 and 11-001 enrolled pediatric patients with newly diagnosed B- or T-ALL from 2005 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2015, respectively. Protocol therapy was nearly identical for patients with T-ALL (N = 123), who were all initially assigned to the high-risk arm. End-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), but was not used to modify postinduction therapy. Early T-cell precursor (ETP) status was determined by flow cytometry. Cases with sufficient diagnostic DNA were retrospectively evaluated by targeted NGS of known genetic drivers of T-ALL, including Notch, PI3K, and Ras pathway genes.  Results:   The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with T-ALL was 81% (95% CI, 73-87%) and 90% (95% CI, 83-94%), respectively. ETP phenotype was associated with failure to achieve complete remission, but not with inferior OS. Low end-induction MRD (<10-4 ) was associated with superior disease-free survival (DFS). Pathogenic mutations of the PI3K pathway were mutually exclusive of ETP phenotype and were associated with inferior 5-year DFS and OS.  Conclusions:   Together, our findings demonstrate that ETP phenotype, end-induction MRD, and PI3K pathway mutation status are prognostically relevant in pediatric T-ALL and should be considered for risk classification in future trials.

It is thus important to help such patients to regain and retain best possible stability to improve their quality of life. One option is the double-shelled brace (DSB). The aim of this study was to provide information on the degree of correction when using a DSB on patients with neuromuscular scoliosis.  Methods:   We included patients with neuromuscular scoliosis treated with double-shelled braces in this retrospective study. Radiographs of the full spine were taken with and without the DSB, the Cobb angles were measured and compared. The correction was expressed in percent of the lumbar and thoracic Cobb angles. In addition, compounding factors such as age, sex, type of the curves, and movement disorder were included.  Results:   We analyzed data from 84 patients with scoliosis with different neuromuscular disorders. The mean age was 12.3 years (± 5.9). In the lumbar spine we detected an improvement of 27.5% (SD ± 32.9), in the thoracic spine 25.3% (SD ± 38.0).  Interpretation:   Short-term corrections with a double-shelled brace in neuromuscular scoliosis present an average improvement of one fourth of the lumbar and thoracic Cobb angles and, independent of age, sex, movement disorder, shape or type of the curve.

Nevertheless, as breast reconstruction is becoming more available, more patients undergo both implant-based breast reconstruction and radiotherapy. The dilemma is how to manage capsular contracture if it does occur. The goal of this study was to examine the outcome of patients with implant-based breast reconstruction who developed postirradiation capsular contracture and were treated with capsulotomy or capsulectomy, with or without fat grafting.  Methods:   The authors reviewed charts of patients who developed capsular contracture following alloplastic breast reconstruction followed by radiation therapy, between 2008 and 2018. The surgical treatment methods for capsular contracture were evaluated along with their outcomes. A follow-up of at least 1 year was required.  Results:   Forty-eight breasts with postirradiation capsular contracture underwent surgical implant exchange with capsular release, of which 15 had combined fat grafting and 33 did not. Overall, 35 breasts (72.9 percent) showed long-term resolution of capsular contracture; 24 underwent a single procedure and 11 required an additional fat grafting procedure. Some patients [six breasts (12.5 percent)] were offered a consecutive round of fat grafting, and some [seven breasts (14.5 percent)] were offered autologous reconstruction because of lack of improvement. Fat grafting increased the success rate by more than 30 percent when it was initially and consecutively used.  Conclusions:   Postirradiation capsular contracture may be treated successfully by secondary procedures, sustaining implant-based breast reconstruction in over 70 percent of breasts. Fat grafting may elevate resolution rates even further, to 86 percent. Larger prospective studies are required to validate these findings.

This study used volumetric computed tomography in live patients to characterize neck fat volume and distribution in young and elderly women.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted of head and neck computed tomographic angiographs of 20 young (aged 20 to 35 years) and 20 old (aged 65 to 89 years) women. Fat volume in the supraplatysmal and subplatysmal planes was quantified. Distribution of fat volume was assessed by dividing each supraplatysmal and subplatysmal compartment into upper, middle, and lower thirds.  Results:   Total supraplatysmal fat volume was greater than subplatysmal in all patients. Young patients had more total supraplatysmal fat than old patients (p < 0.0001). No difference was found between age groups in subplatysmal fat (p > 0.05). No difference was found between upper/middle/lower third supraplatysmal fat volumes in young patients. When comparing supraplatysmal thirds within the elderly population, the middle third fat volume (28.58 ± 20.01 cm3) was greater than both upper (18.93 ± 10.35 cm3) and lower thirds (15.46 ± 11.57 cm3) (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   This study suggests that total supraplatysmal fat volume decreases with age. Older patients had more fat volume in the upper and middle thirds compared with the lower third of the supraplatysmal fat compartment, whereas young patients had more evenly distributed fat. These results suggest that fat deposition and redistribution in the neck occur with age and may be a contributing factor to the obtuse cervicomandibular angle of the elderly.""","""['Susan Orra', 'Kashyap Tadisina', 'Ali Charafeddine', 'Adeeb Derakhshan', 'Sandra Halliburton', 'Ahmed Hashem', 'Gaby Doumit', 'James E Zins']""","""[' From the Department of Plastic Surgery, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital; the Lerner College of Medicine and the Department of Plastic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic; the Department of Plastic Surgery, Saint Louis University; and the University of Montreal, CHU Sainte Justine.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Plast Reconstr Surg""","""['Reply: The Effect of Fat Distribution in the Neck Using Volumetric Computed Tomography.', 'The Effect of Age on Fat Distribution in the Neck Using Volumetric Computed Tomography.', 'Optimizing Outcomes in Neck Lift Surgery.', 'Defining the fat compartments in the neck: a cadaver study.', 'Development and reproducibility of a computed tomography-based measurement for upper body subcutaneous neck fat.', 'Aging Changes of the Superficial Fat Compartments of the Midface Over Time: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.', 'Visceral adiposity and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Association between Neck Circumference and Subclinical Atherosclerosis among Chinese Steelworkers: A Cross-Sectional Survey.']"""

This retrospective study sought to characterize the rates of proximal aortic dilation in young patients, identify risk factors for TAA progression, and evaluate the predictive utility of early echocardiographic follow-up. Inclusion criteria were: (1) TAA or TAA-predisposing genetic diagnosis, (2) age < 25 years at first echocardiogram, and (3) minimum of 5 years of echocardiographic follow-up. Proximal aortic diameters were measured by echocardiography and Z-scores calculated to index for body surface area. TAA severity was classified as no TAA (Z-score < 2), mild (Z-score 2 to 4), or at least moderate (Z-score > 4). Among 141 included patients, mean age at first echocardiogram was 7.3 ± 3.5 years. Mean follow-up duration was 9.8 ± 3.5 years. Fifty five patients had a genetic syndrome, and 38 of the non-syndromic patients had bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The rate of aortic dilation was significantly higher at the ascending aorta than other aortic segments. BAV and age > 10 years at first echocardiogram were associated with increased rate of ascending aorta dilation. At the ascending aorta, over 25% of patients had categorical increase in TAA severity between first and last echocardiograms, and such patients demonstrated higher rate of dilation within their first 2 years of follow-up. These longitudinal findings highlight progressive ascending aorta dilation in young patients, which may worsen around adolescence. This may help determine timing of follow-up and target ages for clinical trials.""","""['Adam P Wheeler', 'Ziyi Yang', 'Timothy M Cordes', 'Larry W Markham', 'Benjamin J Landis']""","""[' Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', ' Department of Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', ' Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA. benjland@iu.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Pediatr Cardiol""","""['Long-Term Risk Factors for Dilatation of the Proximal Aorta in a Large Cohort of Children With Bicuspid Aortic Valve.', 'Abnormal Longitudinal Growth of the Aorta in Children with Familial Bicuspid Aortic Valve.', 'Association between bicuspid aortic valve morphotype and regional dilatation of the aortic root and trunk.', 'Is there a role for autophagy in ascending aortopathy associated with tricuspid or bicuspid aortic valve?', 'Surgical thresholds for bicuspid aortic valve associated aortopathy.', 'High heritability of ascending aortic diameter and trans-ancestry prediction of thoracic aortic disease.', 'Identification of a common polymorphism in COQ8B acting as a modifier of thoracic aortic aneurysm severity.', 'A Novel Human Biospecimen Repository for Clinical and Molecular Investigation of Thoracic Aortopathy.']"""

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides a minimally invasive diagnostic tool to stage patients with known malignancy and procure material for molecular testing. This study characterizes the clinicopathologic associations of patients with adrenal gland FNA from 2 large hospitals.  Materials and methods:   FNAs were identified by query of electronic medical record from 2002-2019. Clinical and pathological information was collated and correlated with corresponding surgical diagnosis when available.  Results:   Of 139 cases, the majority (n = 127, 91%) were adequate computed tomography-guided FNAs and included the following diagnoses: positive for malignancy (n = 77, 55%), negative for malignancy (n = 32, 23%), neoplastic cells present (n = 16, 12%), nondiagnostic (n = 12, 9%), atypical (n = 1, 1%), and suspicious for carcinoma (n = 1, 1%). The majority (94%, n = 72 of 77) of malignancies were metastatic tumors, most frequently carcinoma (n = 53 of 72, 74%), followed by melanoma (n = 11 of 72, 15%), lymphoma (n = 4 of 72, 6%), and sarcoma (n = 4 of 72, 6%). Metastatic carcinomas included lung (n = 21 of 72, 29%), genitourinary (n = 12 of 72, 17%), and hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal tract (n = 11 of 72, 15%) primaries. Primary adrenal neoplasms (n = 23) included adenomas (n = 11 of 23, 48%), pheochromocytomas (n = 4 of 23, 17%), and myelolipomas (n = 3 of 23, 13%). Thirty-two patients with metastases died of disease after median follow-up of 8 months.  Conclusions:   High specimen adequacy (n = 127, 91%) and low indeterminate rates (n = 2, 2%) are achieved with adrenal FNA. Most aspirated lesions represent metastases from primary lung carcinomas, but other primary sites including those below the diaphragm are part of the diagnostic differential.

The primary aim was to investigate the correlation between cerebellar apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and histopathology in infants with HIE. The secondary aim was to compare ADC values in the cerebellum of infants with HIE and infants without brain injury.  Methods:   ADC values in the cerebellar vermis, hemispheres and dentate nucleus (DN) of (near-)term infants with HIE (n = 33) within the first week after birth were compared with neonates with congenital non-cardiac anomalies, normal postoperative MRIs and normal outcome (n = 22). Microglia/macrophage activation was assessed using CD68 and/or HLA-DR staining and Purkinje cell (PC) injury using H&E-stained slices. The correlation between ADC values and the histopathological measures was analyzed.  Results:   ADC values in the vermis (p = 0.021) and DN (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in infants with HIE compared to controls. ADC values in the cerebellar hemispheres were comparable. ADC values in the vermis were correlated with the number and percentage of normal PCs; otherwise ADC values and histology were not correlated.  Conclusion:   Histopathological injury in the cerebellum is common in infants with HIE. ADC values underestimate histopathological injury.  Impact:   ADC values might underestimate cerebellar injury in neonates with HIE. ADC values in the vermis and dentate nucleus of infants with HIE are lower compared to controls, but not in the cerebellar hemispheres. Abnormal ADC values are only found when cytotoxic edema is very severe. ADC values in the vermis are correlated with Purkinje cell injury in the vermis; furthermore, there were no correlations between ADC values and histopathological measures.""","""['Kim V Annink', 'Lilly Meerts', 'Niek E van der Aa', 'Thomas Alderliesten', 'Peter G J Nikkels', 'Cora H A Nijboer', 'Floris Groenendaal', 'Linda S de Vries', 'Manon J N L Benders', 'Freek E Hoebeek', 'Jeroen Dudink']""","""["" Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht Brain Center, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", ' Department of Developmental Origins of Disease, University Medical Center Utrecht Brain Centre, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ' Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', "" Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht Brain Center, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.dudink@umcutrecht.nl.""]""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""Pediatr Res""","""[""The cerebellum's role in neonatal brain injury."", 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging Detects Occult Cerebellar Injury in Severe Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy.', 'Can cerebellar and brainstem apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values predict neuromotor outcome in term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with hypothermia?', 'Pontine and cerebellar injury in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: MRI features and clinical outcomes.', 'Neuroimaging in Neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy.', 'Prevention and treatment of energy failure in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.', 'Hypothermia increases cold-inducible protein expression and improves cerebellar-dependent learning after hypoxia ischemia in the neonatal rat.']"""

The objective of the current study is to examine longitudinal trends (quarter [Q] 1 2010 through Q4 2018) of opioid prescribing volume and high-risk opioid prescribing behaviors in South Carolina using comprehensive dispensing data available in the South Carolina Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (SC PDMP).  Design:   Retrospective analyses of SC PDMP data were performed using general linear models to assess quarterly time trends and change in rate of each outcome Q1 2010 through Q4 2018.  Participants:   Opioid analgesic prescription fills from SC state residents between Q1 2010 and Q4 2018.  Main outcome measures:   High-risk prescribing behaviors included (1) opioid prescribing rate; (2) percentage of patients receiving opioids dispensed 90 or more average morphine milligram equivalents daily; (3) percentage of opioid prescribed days with overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions; (4) rate per 100 000 residents of multiple provider episodes; and (5) percentage of patients prescribed extended release opioids who were opioid naive.  Results:   A total of 33 027 461 opioid prescriptions were filled by SC state residents within the time period of Q1 2010 through Q4 2018. A 41% decrease in the quarterly prescribing rate of opioids occurred from Q1 2010 to Q4 2018. The decrease in overall opioid prescribing was mirrored by significant decreases in all 4 high-risk prescribing behaviors.  Conclusion:   PDMPs may represent the most complete data regarding the dispensing of opioid prescriptions and as such be valuable tools to inform and monitor the supply of licit opioids.

Methods:   Between March 2007 and March 2015, we retrospectively analyzed 63 patients who underwent locking plate fixation for proximal humeral fracture with an unstable medial column. All patients were assigned into group 1 (patients treated with locking plate) and group 2 (patients treated with locking plate with intramedullary fibular allograft). Groups 1 and 2 were composed of 29 and 34 patients, respectively. We analyzed bone union, the neck-shaft angle, the Constant score, the range of motion, and complications.  Results:   The mean average bone union time of the patients was 13.9 weeks in group 1 and 11.3 weeks in group 2. The average Constant score was 67.4 in group 1 and 73.6 in group 2 (p < 0.05). The mean preoperative NSA, postoperative NSA, and NSA at the last follow-up were 104.4°, 125.8°, and 115.8°, respectively, in group 1, and 109.0°, 130.3°, and 127.1°, respectively, in group 2.

In group 1, avascular necrosis occurred in one patient and screw cutout in two patients. In group 2, screw cutout occurred in one patient.  Conclusion:   In patients aged over 65 years with proximal humeral fractures, an unstable medial column was associated with poor clinical results owing to varus collapse. To prevent this, an intramedullary fibular allograft was used, and radiologic and clinical results were better with this approach than with a locking plate alone.

Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker.  Materials and methods:   This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics.  Results:   Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss κ = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19.

Design:   Retrospective trend study.  Subjects:   6 highly attended annual national vitreoretinal meetings from 2015 to 2019 (30 total meetings) METHODS: Conference programs were acquired either through online search or directly from meeting organizers and were reviewed and analyzed. Genders of program committee members, first author main podium presenters of papers and nonpaper presenters, main podium panelists, and main podium moderators were recorded. A χ2 analysis was performed to compare the proportion of women with podium roles in 2015 and those in each subsequent year until 2019.  Main outcome measurements:   change in proportion of women filling faculty roles in 2015 versus those in 2019.  Results:   A total of 4,521 faculty roles were included for analysis. Women filled 22.1% of those roles and were more likely to be included as invited moderators or panelists (25.0%) than as paper (21.4%) or non-paper (19.8%) presenters. Meetings with at least one female program committee member were significantly more likely to include female non-paper presenters (P = .02), moderators or panelists (P = .02), and total women faculty (P < .001). Although there were no significant changes in the proportion of women when comparing consecutive years, the overall trend was for an increased proportion of women faculty, with a significant increase from 19.6% in 2015 to 25.5% in 2019 (P = .002). When the types of faculty roles filled by women were examined, there was a statistically significant increase from 2015 to 2019 in the proportion of abstract presentations (19.7% vs. 25.2%, respectively; P = .045) but a nonstatistically significant increase in invited presentations and moderator or panelist roles.  Conclusions and relevance:   Women filled less than one-fourth of the main podium faculty roles at vitreoretinal meetings included for analysis over a 5-year period, although there was a significant increase in female representation when 2015 and 2019 participation were compared. Meetings with at least 1 female program committee member filled non-paper podium faculty roles with a significantly greater proportion of women.""","""['Jayanth Sridhar', 'Ajay E Kuriyan', 'Yoshihiro Yonekawa', 'Audina Berrocal', 'M Ali Khan', 'R V Paul Chan', 'Julia A Haller']""","""[' Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, FL, USA.

Objective:   Our study aimed to assess the risk of lymph node metastasis depending on the depth of invasion and histological features of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   We retrospectively included all patients undergoing an endoscopic resection for T1 oesophageal adenocarcinoma among seven expert centres in France in 2004-2016. Mural invasion was defined as either intramucosal or submucosal tumours; the latter were further divided into superficial submucosal (<1000 mm) and deep submucosal (>1000 mm). Absence or presence of lymphovascular invasion and/or poorly differentiated cancer (G3) defined a low-risk or a high-risk tumour, respectively. For submucosal tumours, invasion depth and histological features were systematically confirmed after a second dedicated histological assessment (new 2-mm thick slices) performed by a second pathologist. Occurrence of lymph node metastasis was recorded during the follow-up from histological or PET CT reports when an invasive procedure was not possible.  Results:   In total, 188 superficial oesophageal adenocarcinomas were included with a median follow-up of 34 months. No lymph node metastases occurred for intramucosal oesophageal adenocarcinomas (n = 135) even with high-risk histological features. Among submucosal oesophageal adenocarcinomas, only tumours with lymphovascular invasion or poorly differentiated cancer or with a depth of invasion >1000 μm developed lymph node metastasis tumours (n = 10/53%; 18.9%; hazard ratio 12.04). No metastatic evolution occurred under a 1000-mm threshold for all low-risk tumours (0/25), nor under 1200 mm (0/1) and three over this threshold (3/13%, 23.1%).  Conclusion:   Intramucosal and low-risk tumours with shallow submucosal invasion up to 1200 mm were not associated with lymph node metastasis during follow-up. In case of high-risk features and/or deep submucosal invasion, endoscopic resections are not sufficient to eliminate the risk of lymph node metastasis, and surgical oesophagectomy should be carried out. These results must be confirmed by larger prospective series.""","""['Nicolas Benech', ""Jean Marc O'Brien"", 'Maximilien Barret', 'Jéremie Jacques', 'Gabriel Rahmi', 'Guillaume Perrod', 'Valérie Hervieu', 'Alexandre Jaouen', 'Aurélie Charissoux', 'Olivier Guillaud', 'Romain Legros', 'Thomas Walter', 'Jean-Christophe Saurin', 'Jérôme Rivory', 'Fréderic Prat', 'Vincent Lépilliez', 'Thierry Ponchon', 'Mathieu Pioche']""","""["" Service d'Hépato-Gastroentérologie, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon, France."", ' Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.', "" Service d'Hépato-Gastroentérologie, Hôpital de La Croix-Rousse, Hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon, France."", "" Service d'Hepato-Gastroentérologie, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France."", "" Service d'Hepato-Gastroenterologie, Dupuytren University Hospital, Limoges, France."", "" Service d'Hepato-Gastroenterologie, Hôpital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France."", "" Service d'Anatomo-Pathologie, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon, France."", "" Service d'Anatomo-Pathologie, Dupuytren University Hospital, Limoges, France."", "" Service d'Hepato-Gastroenterologie, Clinique de la Sauvegarde, Lyon, France."", ""0 Service d'Hepato-Gastroentérologie, Mermoz Private Hospital, Lyon, France."", '1 INSERM U1032, Lab Tau, Lyon, France.']""","""2021""","""2021 Apr""","""United European Gastroenterol J""","""[""Accuracy of EUS in the evaluation of Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma."", 'Early-stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus with mid to deep submucosal invasion (pT1b sm2-3): the frequency of lymph-node metastasis depends on macroscopic and histological risk patterns.', ""Endoscopic Treatment of Early Barrett's Adenocarcinoma and Dysplasia: Focus on Submucosal Cancer."", ""Endoscopic resection (endoscopic submucosal dissection/endoscopic mucosal resection) for superficial Barrett's esophageal cancer."", ""The modern management of Barrett's oesophagus and related neoplasia: role of pathology."", ""Barrett's Esophagus: An Updated Review."", 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection for early esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas: a systematic review.']"""

National guidelines recommend against streptococcal testing in patients with viral features. This study aims to assess the rate of inappropriate streptococcal rapid antigen detection tests (RADT)s in children evaluated in urgent care clinics (UCC)s and emergency department (ED)s at a children's hospital.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed charts of 10% of children 3 years or older with RADTs ordered between April and September 2018 at EDs and UCCs. The test was determined to be inappropriate if the patient had no sore throat and/or had 2 or more viral symptoms: rhinorrhea/congestion, cough, diarrhea, hoarseness, conjunctivitis, or viral exanthem.  Results:   Over the study period, 7678 RADTs were performed, of which 7024 (91.2%) were in children 3 years or older. We evaluated 708 charts and found 44% of RADTs were inappropriate. The predicted probability of inappropriate RADT was highest among patients with a triaged reason for visit for respiratory complaints (70.5%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (69.7%), and rash (61.3%). Of the inappropriate RADTs, 20.1% were positive, whereas 32.2% of the appropriate RADTs were positive.

Methods:   A retrospective noncomparative interventional case series of 60 eyes having various choroidal and retinal tumors imaged with SS-OCTA (Topcon DR1 Triton Plus, Tokyo, Japan) between September 2018 and February 2020 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were tumor thickness <4 mm, tumor base diameter <10 mm, and tumor location at the posterior pole.  Results:   Choroidal nevi usually demonstrated well-defined borders, hyperreflective internal structure, and no outer retinal involvement on SS-OCTA. Choroidal melanoma, in contrast to nevi, usually had ill-defined borders (p = 0.018), mixed hyperreflective-hyporeflective or hyperreflective internal structure (p = 0.014), and demonstrated outer retinal involvement (p < 0.001). Circumscribed choroidal hemangioma usually presented with well-defined borders, a hyperreflective internal tumor structure with multiple dilated interconnected tumor vessels intermixed with signal void areas representing connective tissue. Optic disc melanocytomas showed a hyporeflective plexus related to blocking of signal by the pigment and an intact radial peripapillary capillary network. There was flow on the surface and slightly deeper within the lesion on B-scan angiography overlay. Retinal astrocytic hamartomas had well-defined borders and a hyperreflective vascular plexus in the superficial and deep retina. Outer retina and choriocapillaris showed hyporeflective change due to shadowing/masking from calcium or high blood flow in the lesion.  Conclusions:   Each of the different retinal and choroidal tumors studied in this series presented with different SS-OCTA features to aid in the differential diagnosis of these conditions.

In this study, we evaluated the applications of MSRSGC in a real-time setting for 2 years.  Materials and methods:   All salivary gland lesions that underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from January 2018 to December 2020 were categorized according to MSRSGC guidelines. The risk of malignancy (ROM) was calculated for each category and compared with the ROM proposed by MSRSGC and recent retrospective studies.  Results:   A total of 160 FNA of salivary gland lesions were categorized as: nondiagnostic (ND) 30 (18%), non-neoplastic (NN) 7 (10.6%), atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) 5 (3.1%), benign neoplasm (BN) 59 (36.8%), salivary gland of uncertain malignant potential (SUMP) 21 (13%), suspicious for malignancy (SM) 3 (1.84%), and malignant (M) 25 (15.6%). Histopathologic follow-up was available for 94 (57.5%) cases. The ROM for each category was ND 54%, NN 0%, AUS 66%, BN 0%, SUMP 37.56%, SM 100%, and M 100%.  Conclusion:   With strict adherence to the diagnostic criteria and MSRSGC guidelines, a ROM of 100% in SM and M categories and a ROM of 0% in NN can be achieved in a real-time setting. The high ROM in the ND category in our study highlights the value of repeat FNA/biopsy for this category.

IOCP revealed remaining collaterals in six patients and residual hypoplastic PV in eight patients. Two patients required additional interruption of the potential collaterals under IOCP, which were unable to be recognized as a dominant portosystemic collateral pathway on preoperative imaging. All eight patients with residual hypoplastic PV required vein graft interposition for the complete removal of the hypoplastic PV. All the patients are currently doing well with a median follow-up period of 4.9 years (IQR, 2.2-5.6 years). IOCP can be an effective tool for precisely detecting occult portosystemic collateral pathways and for assessing the patency of the PV anastomosis in pediatric LDLT.""","""['Hajime Uchida', 'Seisuke Sakamoto', 'Seiichi Shimizu', 'Masahiro Takeda', 'Yusuke Yanagi', 'Akinari Fukuda', 'Mohamed Sami Abdelwahed', 'Osamu Miyazaki', 'Shunsuke Nosaka', 'Mureo Kasahara']""","""[' Organ Transplantation Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Division of Radiology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.']""","""2021""","""2021 Mar""","""Pediatr Transplant""","""['Usability of intraoperative cine-portogram during liver transplantation in young pediatric patients with biliary atresia.', 'Application of intraoperative cine-portogram to detect spontaneous portosystemic collaterals missed by intraoperative doppler exam in adult living donor liver transplantation.', 'Section 6.

We aimed to identify possible relations between sleep parameters and the sizes of the ascending aorta (AA), the descending thoracic aorta (DTA), and the main pulmonary artery (MPA) in patients with untreated OSA and in a subgroup of participants without comorbidities capable of affecting the size of great thoracic vessels.  Methods:   We retrospectively measured AA, DTA, and MPA sizes on the chest computed tomography scans of 60 patients with OSA who underwent sleep studies within 1 year before or after the computed tomography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on all patient findings, while an additional univariate analysis was conducted on the data for 22 participants without comorbidities. The latter had been divided into subgroups depending on the sleep parameters, and comparisons were made between them.  Results:   The logarithm of the time of oxygen saturation below 90% (CT90) significantly predicted AA and MPA sizes in all patients with OSA (P < .05). Oxygen desaturation index and minimum oxygen saturation were moderately correlated with AA and DTA sizes in patients without comorbidities (P < .01). In this group, subjects with oxygen desaturation index > 30 or minimum oxygen saturation < 81% had greater AA and DTA dimensions (P < .05).  Conclusions:   In patients with OSA, time of oxygen saturation < 90% influenced AA and MPA sizes. In those patients without comorbidities, oxygen desaturation index and minimum oxygen saturation were moderately correlated with both AA and DTA sizes.

Subjects/methods:   We retrospectively assessed using a longitudinal approach the relation between baseline TSH levels and short-term (6 and 12 months) weight loss in 387 euthyroid patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB; n = 187) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n = 200).  Results:   After LAGB, patients with low-normal TSH levels (0.40-1.40 mUI/L) had higher percent total weight loss, ∆BMI and percent excess weight loss when compared to patients with normal (1.41-2.48 mUI/L) and high-normal (2.49-4.00 mUI/L) TSH (p < 0.05). Conversely, no association was detected after SG (p = 0.17). The multivariable regression analysis showed that also baseline BMI (6-12 months) and HOMA2-IR (only at 6 months) were independently associated with the outcomes.

We hypothesized that an individualized adaptive treatment approach based on midtreatment liver function would maintain good local control while limiting toxicity in this population.  Methods and materials:   Patients with CTP-B liver disease and HCC were treated on prospective trials of individualized adaptive SBRT between 2006 and 2018. Patients underwent pre- and midtreatment liver function assessments using indocyanine green. Treatment-related toxicity was defined as a ≥2-point increase in CTP score from pretreatment within 6 months of treatment. In addition, we performed analyses with a longitudinal model to assess changes in CTP score over 12 months after SBRT.  Results:   Eighty patients with CTP-B (median tumor size, 2.5 cm) were treated: 37 patients were CTP-B-7, 28 were CTP-B-8, and 15 were CTP-B-9. The median treatment dose was 36 Gy in 3 fractions. One-year local control was 92%. In a multivariate model controlling for tumor size, treatment dose, and baseline CTP score, higher treatment dose was associated with improved freedom from local progression (hazard ratio: 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.00; P = .04). Eighteen patients (24%) had a ≥2-point increase in CTP score within 6 months of SBRT. In a longitudinal model assessing changes in CTP score over 12 months after SBRT, controlling for baseline CTP and tumor size, increasing mean liver dose was associated with larger increases in CTP score (P = .04).  Conclusions:   An individualized adaptive treatment approach allows for acceptable toxicity and effective local control in patients with HCC and CTP-B liver disease. Because increasing dose may increase both local control and toxicity, further work is needed to optimize treatment in patients with compromised liver function.""","""['William C Jackson', 'Ming Tang', 'Christopher Maurino', 'Mishal Mendiratta-Lala', 'Neehar D Parikh', 'Martha M Matuszak', 'Janell S Dow', 'Yue Cao', 'Charles S Mayo', 'Randall K Ten Haken', 'Matthew J Schipper', 'Kyle C Cuneo', 'Dawn Owen', 'Theodore S Lawrence']""","""[' University of Michigan Department of Radiation Oncology, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Most diagnostic laboratories report this simply as a qualitative positive/negative result. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and serological relevance of a novel subset of anti-Ro60 in patients who display low levels of anti-Ro60 (anti-Ro60low ). We retrospectively identified anti-Ro60 sera during a 12-month period at a major immunopathology diagnostic laboratory in Australia. These all were anti-Ro60-precipitin-positive on the diagnostic gold standard counter-immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP). Lineblot immunoassay was used to stratify patients into either anti-Ro60low or anti-Ro60high subsets. We compared the medical and laboratory parameters associated with each group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mass spectrometry techniques were used to analyse the serological and molecular basis behind the two subsets. Anti-Ro60low patients displayed less serological activity than anti-Ro60high patients with less intermolecular spreading, hypergammaglobulinaemia and less tendency to undergo anti-Ro60 isotype-switching than anti-Ro60high patients. Mass spectrometric typing of the anti-Ro60low subset showed restricted variable heavy chain subfamily usage and amino acid point mutations. This subset also displayed clinical relevance, being present in a number of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD). We identify a novel anti-Ro60low patient subset that is distinct from anti-Ro60high patients serologically and molecularly. It is not clear whether they arise from common or separate origins; however, they probably have different developmental pathways to account for the stark difference in immunological maturity. We hence demonstrate significance to anti-Ro60low and justify accurate detection in the diagnostic laboratory.""","""['A Y S Lee', 'D Beroukas', 'L Brown', 'C Lucchesi', 'A Kaur', 'L Gyedu', 'N Hughes', 'Y H Ng', 'O Saran', 'T P Gordon', 'J J Wang']""","""[' Department of Immunology, SA Pathology and Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, SA, Australia.', ' College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, Australia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Clin Exp Immunol""","""['Diagnostic Utility of Separate Anti-Ro60 and Anti-Ro52/TRIM21 Antibody Detection in Autoimmune Diseases.', 'Association of anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60 and anti-La antibodies with diagnostic, clinical and laboratory features in a referral hospital in Jerez, Spain.', 'Latest update on the Ro/SS-A autoantibody system.', 'Anti-Ro52 reactivity is an independent and additional serum marker in connective tissue disease.', 'The molecular basis of the SSA/Ro antigens and the clinical significance of their autoantibodies.', ""Antibodies to Both Ro52 and Ro60 for Identifying Sjögren's Syndrome Patients Best Suited for Clinical Trials of Disease-Modifying Therapies.""]"""

Four phenotypes of reverse triggering with and without breath stacking and their impact on lung inflation and deflation were investigated.Measurements and Main Results: Inflation volumes, respiratory muscle pressure generation, and transpulmonary pressures were determined and phenotypes differentiated using Campbell diagrams of respiratory activity. Reverse triggering was detected in 25 patients, 15 with associated breath stacking, and 13 with stable reverse triggering consistent with respiratory entrainment. Phenotypes were associated with variable levels of inspiratory effort (mean 4-10 cm H2O per phenotype). Early reverse triggering with early expiratory relaxation increased Vts (88 [64-113] ml) and inspiratory transpulmonary pressures (3 [2-3] cm H2O) compared with passive breaths. Early reverse triggering with delayed expiratory relaxation increased Vts (128 [86-170] ml) and increased inspiratory and mean-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (7 [5-9] cm H2O and 5 [4-6] cm H2O). Mid-cycle reverse triggering (initiation during inflation and maximal effort during deflation) increased Vt (51 [38-64] ml), increased inspiratory and mean-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (3 [2-4] cm H2O and 3 [2-3] cm H2O), and caused incomplete exhalation. Late reverse triggering (occurring exclusively during exhalation) increased mean expiratory transpulmonary pressure (2 [1-2] cm H2O) and caused incomplete exhalation.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for VI-RADS score 5 vs. score 2-4 cases to assess the accuracy of mpMRI for extravesical BCa detection (≥pT3). VI-RADS score performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. A Κ statistic was calculated to estimate mpMRI and pathological diagnostic agreement.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed for 11 cases, molecular studies for 6 cases, and needle rinse calcitonin level for 1 case. When correlated with surgical follow-ups, the risk of malignancy (ROM) was 91.18% for SNPTC compared to 93.75 for SPTC%.  Conclusions:   SNPTC was rarely diagnosed when compared with SPTC. SMTC was the most commonly diagnosed SNPTC subgroup, followed by SNOS. The ROM of SNPTC was slightly lower than that of SPTC. Ancillary studies and previous clinical history, in addition to cytomorphology, was helpful when rendering the diagnosis of SNPTC.""","""['Sayanan Chowsilpa', 'Robert Jones', 'Jen-Fan Hang', 'Syed Z Ali']""","""[' Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', ' Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', ' Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.', ' Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Radiology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.

Calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) inhibitors (CNIs) such as tacrolimus are used to prevent rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Although their effect on lymphocytes has been studied extensively, there are limited experimental data about if and how CNIs shape innate immunity, and whether this contributes to the higher rates of infection observed in patients taking CNIs.  Approach and results:   Here, we investigated the impact of tacrolimus treatment on innate immunity and, more specifically, on the capability of Kupffer cells (KCs) to fight infections. Retrospective analysis of data of >2,700 liver transplant recipients showed that taking calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus significantly increased the likelihood of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Using a mouse model of acute methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, most bacteria were sequestered in the liver and we found that bacteria were more likely to disseminate and kill the host in tacrolimus-treated mice. Using imaging, we unveiled the mechanism underlying this observation: the reduced capability of KCs to capture, phagocytose, and destroy bacteria in tacrolimus-treated animals. Furthermore, in a gene expression analysis of infected KCs, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) pathway was the one with the most significant down-regulation after tacrolimus treatment. TREM1 inhibition likewise inhibited KC bacteria capture. TREM1 levels on neutrophils as well as the overall neutrophil response after infection were unaffected by tacrolimus treatment.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that tacrolimus treatment has a significant impact directly on KCs and on TREM1, thereby compromising their capacity to fend off infections.""","""['Carsten Deppermann#', 'Moritz Peiseler#', 'Joel Zindel', 'Lori Zbytnuik', 'Woo-Yong Lee', 'Elisa Pasini', 'Cristina Baciu', 'John Matelski', 'Yun Lee', 'Deepali Kumar', 'Atul Humar', 'Bas Surewaard', 'Paul Kubes#', 'Mamatha Bhat#']""","""[' Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, AL, Canada.', ' Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ' Department of Medicine, Multi-Organ Transplant Program, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' Biostatistics Research Unit, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""Hepatology""","""['Bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus.', 'The Antidepressant Mirtazapine Activates Hepatic\xa0Macrophages, Facilitating Pathogen Clearance While Limiting Tissue Damage in Mice.', 'Identification and treatment of the Staphylococcus aureus reservoir in vivo.', 'Treatment strategies in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients with calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity.', 'Tacrolimus in transplant rejection.', 'Breaking the Gingival Barrier in Periodontitis.', 'Crosstalk between liver macrophages and gut microbiota: An important component of inflammation-associated liver diseases.', 'Intravital Imaging Allows Organ-Specific Insights Into Immune Functions.', 'Staphylococcus aureus Host Tropism and Its Implications for Murine Infection Models.']"""

A total of 50 female patients with CVST were included in the study. Twenty-four (48%) cases occurred during pregnancy and puerperium. The mean age of the pregnant or puerperal patients was lower than that of the other patients (p = 0.007). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of clinical and neuroradiological findings or presence of any additional risk factors including hereditary thrombophilia. There was also no difference in terms of in-hospital mortality rates and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 6 months between the groups. The clinical presentation of CVST and the frequencies of the presence of other risk factors including genetic thrombophilia in pregnant and puerperal patients were similar to those of non-pregnant female patients.

We hypothesized that radiomics characteristics may be related to tumor proliferation. To evaluate whether computed tomography (CT) radiomics feature analyses could aid in assessing the Ki-67 marker index in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we retrospectively analyzed preoperative CT findings of 74 patients with HCC. The texture feature calculations were computed from MaZda 4.6 software, and the sequential forward selection algorithm was used as the selection method. The correlation between radiomics features and the Ki-67 marker index, as well as the difference between low Ki-67 (<10%) and high Ki-67 (≥10%) groups were evaluated. A simple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the associations between texture features and high Ki-67, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed on important parameters to assess the ability of radiomics characteristics to distinguish the high Ki-67 group from the low Ki-67 group. Contrast, correlation, and inverse difference moment (IDM) were significantly different (P < 0.001) between the low and high Ki-67 groups. Contrast (odds ratio [OR] = 0.957; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.926-0.990, P = 0.01) and correlation (OR = 2.5☆105; 95% CI: 7.560-8.9☆109; P = 0.019) were considered independent risk factors for combined model building with logistic regression. Angular second moment (r = -0.285, P = 0.014), contrast (r = -0.449, P < 0.001), correlation (r = 0.552, P < 0.001), IDM (r = 0.458, P < 0.001), and entropy (r = 0.285, P = 0.014) strongly correlated with the Ki-67 scores. Contrast, correlation, and the combined predictor were predictive of Ki-67 status (P < 0.001), with areas under the curve ranging from 0.777 to 0.836.

This original research will investigate if preserved bladder contractility can predict a successful treatment with SNM.  Methods:   This is a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients with DU, who had a staged SNM trial from January 2013 to December 2018, with a minimum of 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome was the success of stage 1 SNM trial.  Results:   In total, 69 patients with DU were followed. The median age was 67 [interquartile range (IQR) 74-55], median baseline bladder contractility index (BCI) 18 (IQR 67-0), and median post-void residual 200 mL (IQR 300-130). There were 35 patients (51%) that responded to a SNM trial. At a median follow-up of 23 months (IQR 39-12), three were removed for poor efficacy. In patients with detrusor acontractility (DAC), six responded (33%), compared to 29 patients (57%) with BCI > 0. This was statistically significant, p value 0.03. Younger age was also a predictive factor for SNM response, p value 0.02. There were no differences noted in those with gender, neurogenic history, previous pelvic surgery, diabetes, or pre-operative voiding history.  Conclusion:   Our study showed that patients with preserved bladder contractility are more likely to respond to a trial of SNM compared with those that have DAC. Younger age was also predictive of SNM response. UDS is the only method to accurately identify DAC patients.

Methods:   We propose DL-ESPIRiT, an unrolled neural network architecture that utilizes an extended coil sensitivity model to address SENSE-related field-of-view (FOV) limitations in previously proposed deep learning-based reconstruction frameworks. Additionally, we propose a novel neural network design based on (2+1)D spatiotemporal convolutions to produce more accurate dynamic MRI reconstructions than conventional 3D convolutions. The network is trained on fully sampled 2D cardiac cine datasets collected from 11 healthy volunteers with IRB approval. DL-ESPIRiT is compared against a state-of-the-art parallel imaging and compressed sensing method known as l1 -ESPIRiT. The reconstruction accuracy of both methods is evaluated on retrospectively undersampled datasets (R = 12) with respect to standard image quality metrics as well as automatic deep learning-based segmentations of left ventricular volumes. Feasibility of DL-ESPIRiT is demonstrated on two prospectively undersampled datasets acquired in a single heartbeat per slice.  Results:   The (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT method produces higher fidelity image reconstructions when compared to l1 -ESPIRiT reconstructions with respect to standard image quality metrics (P < .001). As a result of improved image quality, segmentations made from (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT images are also more accurate than segmentations from l1 -ESPIRiT images.  Conclusions:   DL-ESPIRiT synergistically combines a robust parallel imaging model and deep learning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions of retrospectively undersampled 2D cardiac cine data acquired with reduced FOV.

Although surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, the role of additional therapy remains controversial. Our objectives were to describe treatment strategies for stage III/IV thymoma in the United States and compare survival outcomes among treatment approaches.  Methods:   We identified Masaoka stage III/IV thymoma reported in the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2016. Frequencies of treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and combinations were calculated. Five-year overall survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Risk-adjusted proportional hazards modeling compared mortality between treatment regimens.  Results:   A total of 1849 patients were identified (1108 stage III, 741 stage IV). Among stage III patients, 83.8% underwent resection (± other modalities) compared with 60.2% of stage IV. Surgery plus radiation was the most common regimen for stage III (32.6%), and nonsurgical treatment (definitive chemotherapy and/or radiation) was the most common for stage IV (36.4%). Overall 5-year survival was 70.3% for stage III and 58.5% for stage IV. In risk-adjusted analysis, surgery plus radiation had the lowest mortality (hazard ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.55). Patient age, tumor size, metastases, and non-academic treating hospital were associated with mortality.  Conclusions:   Current treatment regimens for advanced stage thymoma vary significantly. Regimens that include surgical resection are most common and are associated with superior outcomes. Patients selected to have surgery as primary treatment had the best survival. Adjuvant radiation treatment is associated with better survival and should be considered in patients who undergo resection.""","""['Rhami Khorfan', 'Ankit Bharat', 'David D Odell']""","""[' Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center (SOQIC), Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', ' Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', ' Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center (SOQIC), Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois; Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.

In pediatric blunt trauma, multiple studies have shown that increased CT usage does not necessarily equate to improvements in mortality. The aim of this study was to compare CT usage between level 1 pediatric trauma centers versus level 2 pediatric centers and adult level 1 and 2 centers.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective, multicenter analysis of National Trauma Data Bank patient records from the single admission year of 2015. Eligible subjects were defined as younger than 18 years with abdominal or thoracic blunt trauma, had an Injury Severity Scale score of greater than 15, and were treated at a level 1 or 2 trauma center. Data were then compared between children treated at level 1 pediatric trauma centers (PTC group) versus level 2 PTCs or adult level 1/2 trauma centers (ATC group). The primary outcomes measured were rates of head, thoracic, abdominal CT, and mortality. Data from ATC and PTC groups were propensity matched for age, sex, race, and Glasgow Coma Scale.  Results:   There were 6242 patients after exclusion criteria. Because of differences in patient demographics, we propensity matched 2 groups of 1395 patients. Of these patients, 39.6% of PTC patients received abdominal CT versus 45.5% of ATC patients (P = 0.0017). Similarly, 21.9% of PTC patients received thoracic CT versus 34.7% of ATC patients (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in head CT usage between PTC and ATC groups (P = 1.0000). There was no significant difference in mortality between patients treated in the PTC versus ATC groups (P = 0.1198).  Conclusions:   Among children with severe blunt trauma, patients treated at level 1 PTCs were less likely to receive thoracic and abdominal CTs than those treated at level 2 pediatric or adult trauma level 1/2 centers, with no significant differences in mortality. These findings support the use of selective imaging in severe blunt pediatric trauma.""","""['Ellen L Wiitala', 'Jessica L Parker', 'Jeffrey S Jones', 'Christopher A Benner']""","""[' From the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine.', ' Spectrum Health Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids, MI.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Pediatr Emerg Care""","""['Computed tomography rates and estimated radiation-associated cancer risk among injured children treated at different trauma center types.', 'The adherence of adult trauma centers to American Pediatric Surgical Association guidelines on management of blunt splenic injuries.', 'Adolescent blunt solid organ injury: Differences in management strategies and outcomes between pediatric and adult trauma centers.', 'Impact of pediatric trauma centers on mortality in a statewide system.', 'Injured adolescents, not just large children: difference in care and outcome between adult and pediatric trauma centers.']"""

Research question:   The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between tumor size and the receipt of segmentectomy or lobectomy in association with overall survival in patients with clinically node-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Study design and methods:   The 2004-2015 National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients with cT1-3N0M0 NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy or lobectomy without neoadjuvant therapy or missing survival data. The primary outcome was overall survival, which was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards including an interaction term between tumor size and type of surgery.  Results:   A total of 143,040 patients were included: 135,446 (95%) underwent lobectomy and 7594 (5%) underwent segmentectomy. In multivariate Cox regression, a significant three-way interaction was found among tumor size, histologic results, and type of surgery (P < .001). When patients were stratified by histologic results, lobectomy was associated with significantly improved survival compared with segmentectomy beyond a tumor size of approximately 10 mm for adenocarcinoma and 15 mm for squamous cell carcinoma that was recapitulated in subgroup analyses. No interaction between tumor size and type of surgery was found for patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

Objective:   To correlate cervical lordosis, T1-slope, and clinical outcomes of CDA.  Methods:   The study retrospectively analyzed 95 patients who underwent 1-level CDA and had 2-yr follow-up. They were divided into a high T1-slope (≥28°) group (HTSG, n = 45) and a low T1-slope (<28°) group (LTSG, n = 50). Cervical spinal alignment parameters, including T1-slope, cervical lordosis (C2-7 Cobb angle), and segmental mobility (range of motion [ROM]) at the indexed level, were compared. The clinical outcomes were also assessed.  Results:   The mean T1-slope was 28.1 ± 7.0°. After CDA, the pre- and postoperative segmental motility remained similar and cervical lordosis was preserved. All the clinical outcomes improved after CDA. The HTSG were similar to the LTSG in age, sex, segmental mobility, and clinical outcomes. However, the HTSG had higher cervical lordosis than the LTSG. Furthermore, the LTSG had increased cervical lordosis (ΔC2-7 Cobb angle), whereas the HTSG had decreased lordosis after CDA. Patients of the LTSG, who had more improvement in cervical lordosis, had a trend toward increasing segmental mobility at the index level (ΔROM) than the HTSG.  Conclusion:   In this series, T1-slope correlated well with global cervical lordosis but did not affect the segmental mobility. After CDA, the changes in cervical lordosis correlated with changes in segmental mobility. Therefore, segmental lordosis should be cautiously preserved during CDA as it could determine the mobility of the disc.""","""['Yi-Hsuan Kuo', 'Chao-Hung Kuo', 'Hsuan-Kan Chang', 'Li-Yu Fay', 'Tsung-Hsi Tu', 'Chih-Chang Chang', 'Henrich Cheng', 'Ching-Lan Wu', 'Jiing-Feng Lirng', 'Jau-Ching Wu', 'Wen-Cheng Huang']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Taiwan International Graduate Program in Molecular Medicine, National Yang-Ming University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Radiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']""","""2020""","""2020 Nov""","""Neurosurgery""","""['Commentary: The Effect of T1-Slope in Spinal Parameters After Cervical Disc Arthroplasty.', 'Can segmental mobility be increased by cervical arthroplasty?', 'Effects of smoking on cervical disc arthroplasty.', 'Effect of preoperative segmental range of motion on patient outcomes in cervical disc arthroplasty.', 'Cervical radiographic parameters in 1- and 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.', 'Cervical disc arthroplasty for less-mobile discs.', 'Cervical sagittal alignment changes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, laminectomy with fusion, and laminoplasty for multisegmental cervical spondylotic myelopathy.', 'Late complication of cervical disc arthroplasty: heterotopic ossification causing myelopathy after 10 years.

Study type:   Prospective (""fully-sampled"" multi-shell) and retrospective longitudinal (multi-b).  Subjects:   One normal subject (multi-shell) and 10 breast cancer subjects imaging at four timepoints (multi-b).  Field strength/sequence:   3T multi-shell acquisition and 1.5T multi-b acquisition.  Assessment:   The ""fully-sampled"" multi-shell acquisition was retrospectively downsampled to determine the bias and error from downsampling. Mean, axial/parallel, radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy (FA) were analyzed. Denoising was applied retrospectively to the multi-b-valued breast cancer subject dataset and assessed subjectively for image noise level and tumor conspicuity.  Statistical tests:   Parametric paired t-test (P < 0.05 considered statistically significant) on mean and coefficient of variation of each metric-the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from all b-values, fast ADC, slow ADC, and perfusion fraction. Paired and two-sample t-tests for each metric comparing normal and tumor tissue.  Results:   In the multi-shell data, denoising effectively suppressed FA (-45% to -78%), with small biases in mean diffusivity (-5% in normal, +23% in tumor, and -4% in vascular compartments). In the multi-b data, denoising resulted in small biases to the ADC metrics in tumor and normal contralateral tissue (by -3% to +11%), but greatly reduced the coefficient of variation for every metric (by -1% to -24%). Denoising improved differentiation of tumor and normal tissue regions in most metrics and timepoints; subjectively, image noise level and tumor conspicuity were improved in the fast ADC maps.

Methods:   A total of 390 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated between October 1997 and October 2017. Patients included in our analysis were those with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma who were node-positive, treated definitively, and with at least one follow-up visit and post-treatment imaging scan. We excluded those without follow-up and those treated with palliative intent. All patients were treated with external beam radiation to pelvic±para-aortic fields with concurrent weekly cisplatin. All lymph nodes present at the time of treatment were stratified by size as <2 cm or ≥2 cm. Acute and late gastrointestinal toxicity were recorded for all patients.  Results:   A total of 77 patients with 206 lymph nodes were identified. Median stage at presentation was FIGO IIB. Thirteen patients underwent definitive surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation, of which 12 were treated to doses ≤5040 (range 2700-5940) cGy. Sixty-four patients were treated with definitive chemoradiation, of which 42 (66%) received ≤5040 (range 4500-5040) cGy and 22 (34%) received >5040 (range 5300-6640) cGy. Patients with pre-chemoradiation lymph nodes ≥2 cm had inferior lymph node control compared with patients with pre-chemoradiation lymph node <2 cm at 12 months (77% vs 100%, p=0.002). Radiation dose >5040 cGy was not significantly associated with improved lymph node control compared with ≤5040 cGy when analyzing all patients (12 months, 100% vs 89%, p=0.112). In patients with pre-chemoradiation lymph nodes ≥2 cm, radiation dose >5040 cGy was associated with improved lymph node control (12 months, 100% vs 60%, p=0.020). Acute grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxicity was not associated with radiation dose >5040 cGy (20% vs 13%, p=0.424). Two patients developed grade ≥2 late gastrointestinal toxicity, both of whom were treated to ≤5040 cGy.

Presentation at regional ED was the only factor associated with delay in antibiotic administration (odds ratio, 9.73; 95% confidence interval, 5.37-17.63; P < 0.0001). Delay in antibiotic administration was not associated with greater need for aggressive medical care (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-3.29; P = 0.5).

We sought to describe presenting features of pediatric anaphylaxis and compare patient characteristics and outcomes of children treated with prehospital EPI with those untreated.  Methods:   We abstracted data from emergency department (ED) records for children meeting the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Disease criteria for anaphylaxis (2015-2017) in one tertiary care children's hospital. We analyzed associations between patient characteristics and outcomes and receipt of prehospital EPI using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Of 414 children presenting with anaphylaxis, 39.4% received IM EPI and 62.1% received antihistamines before hospital arrival. Children with Medicaid received pre-emergency department EPI less frequently than did children with private insurance (24.5% vs 43.8%, P = 0.001). Factors positively associated with prehospital EPI administration were history of food allergy (odds ratio [OR], 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.4-8.2]) or arrival by emergency medical services (OR, 8.0 [95% CI, 4.2-15.0]). Medicaid insurance was associated with decreased odds of prehospital EPI (OR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.66]) and prehospital H1-antihistamine use (OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.17-0.56]). Prehospital EPI treatment was also associated with decreased rates of observation (37% vs 63%), inpatient admission (38% vs 62%), and intensive care unit admission (20% vs 80%) compared with no pretreatment (P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Prehospital treatment with EPI remains low, and barriers to optimal treatment are more pronounced in children with public insurance.

Objective:   To assess the ability of LACE+ to predict adverse outcomes after supratentorial brain tumor surgery.  Methods:   LACE+ scores were retrospectively calculated for all patients (n = 624) who underwent surgery for supratentorial tumors at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (2017-2019). Confounding variables were controlled with coarsened exact matching. The frequency of unplanned hospital readmission, ED visits, and death was compared for patients with different LACE+ score quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4).  Results:   A total of 134 patients were matched between Q1 and Q4; 152 patients were matched between Q2 and Q4; and 192 patients were matched between Q3 and Q4. Patients with higher LACE+ scores were significantly more likely to be readmitted within 90 d (90D) of discharge for Q1 vs Q4 (21.88% vs 46.88%, P = .005) and Q2 vs Q4 (27.03% vs 55.41%, P = .001).

The goal of this feasibility study was to establish a proof-of-principle concept towards automating the application of LI-RADS, using a deep learning algorithm trained to segment the liver and delineate HCCs on MRI automatically.  Methods:   In this retrospective single-center study, multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRIs using T1-weighted breath-hold sequences acquired from 2010 to 2018 were used to train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a U-Net architecture. The U-Net was trained (using 70% of all data), validated (15%) and tested (15%) on 174 patients with 231 lesions. Manual 3D segmentations of the liver and HCC were ground truth. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was measured between manual and DCNN methods. Postprocessing using a random forest (RF) classifier employing radiomic features and thresholding (TR) of the mean neural activation was used to reduce the average false positive rate (AFPR).  Results:   73 and 75% of HCCs were detected on validation and test sets, respectively, using > 0.2 DSC criterion between individual lesions and their corresponding segmentations. Validation set AFPRs were 2.81, 0.77, 0.85 for U-Net, U-Net + RF, and U-Net + TR, respectively. Combining both RF and TR with the U-Net improved the AFPR to 0.62 and 0.75 for the validation and test sets, respectively. Mean DSC between automatically detected lesions using the DCNN + RF + TR and corresponding manual segmentations was 0.64/0.68 (validation/test), and 0.91/0.91 for liver segmentations.  Conclusion:   Our DCNN approach can segment the liver and HCCs automatically.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if patient-reported anxiety correlates with pathologic characteristics, voiding symptoms, and objective metrics of bladder emptying in male patients undergoing holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). Patients and Methods: We began collecting patient-reported anxiety scores (generalized anxiety disorder 7-item or GAD-7) in addition to patient-reported scores of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) starting in November 2018 for men with LUTS due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). We retrospectively evaluated the relationship between preoperative GAD-7 score with preoperative age, body mass index (BMI), preoperative urine flow metrics, preoperative postvoid residual (PVR), and preoperative symptom scores for LUTS (American Urological Association, BPH impact index [BII], and Michigan incontinence symptom index [MISI]) and ED (sexual health inventory for men and male sexual health questionnaire for ejaculatory dysfunction [MSHQ-EjD]). We then compared preoperative GAD-7 score with enucleated prostate weight, postoperative GAD-7 scores, postoperative urine flow metrics, postoperative PVR, and postoperative symptom scores for LUTS and ED. Results: We included 139 patients for analysis. The preoperative GAD-7 score positively correlated with preoperative BII scores (rs = 0.202, p = 0.019), MISI total (rs = 0.260, p = 0.002), and MISI bother (rs = 0.345, p < 0.001) scores. Preoperative GAD-7 negatively correlated with preoperative MSHQ-EjD (rs = -0.191, p = 0.031). Following HoLEP, all four of these correlations disappear. The GAD-7 score did not correlate with age, BMI, preoperative urine flow metrics, preoperative PVR, or other preoperative LUTS and ED symptom scores. In addition, preoperative GAD-7 score showed no correlation with enucleated prostate weight, postoperative urine flow metrics, postoperative PVR, and postoperative LUTS and ED symptom scores. Conclusions: Higher preoperative anxiety correlated with more severe preoperative urinary LUTS, particularly incontinence symptoms, in patients undergoing HoLEP.

Methods:   A retrospective study of all primiparous women who delivered at term by VAD between 2011 and 2019 and underwent ultrasound with fetal biometry within 1 week prior to delivery. Women who suffered OASIS were compared to women without OASIS.  Results:   Overall, 74 of 3222 (2.3%) primiparous women suffered an OASIS. As compared with control, women with OASIS were younger (median 28 vs. 30 years, p = 0.001), had higher BMI (median 28.2 vs. 26.9 kg/m2, p = 0.03), and had a longer second stage of labor (median 190 vs. 168 min, p = 0.01). Fetal head circumference was larger in the OASIS group (mean 334 vs. 330 mm, p = 0.03), occiput posterior fetal head position was more prevalent (12 (16%) vs. 232 (7.4%), OR [95% CI]: 2.43 (1.29-4.57), p = 0.004), and the rate of mediolateral episiotomy performed was lower (58 (78.0%) vs. 2777 (88.2%), OR [95% CI]: 0.48 (0.27-0.85), p = 0.01). Multivariate regression modeling identified higher fetal HC (aOR [95% CI] 1.03 (1.001-1.06), p = 0.04) and occiput posterior (aOR [95% CI] 2.5 (1.16-5.71), p = 0.01) as independently positively associated with OASIS. Mediolateral episiotomy and maternal age were independently negatively associated with an OASIS (aOR [95% CI] 0.39 (0.18-0.85), p = 0.01); aOR [95% CI] 0.4 (0.17-0.60), p = 0.001).

Methods:   Fifty-two junior Australian Rules football players were split into 3 groups based on proximity to peak height velocity, while 46 senior players were split into 2 groups based on playing status. The subjects completed the Athletic Ability Assessment-6 (inclusive of the overhead squat, double lunge, single-leg Romanian dead lift, push-up, and chin-up). All subjects were filmed and retrospectively assessed by a single rater. A 1-way analysis of variance and effect-size statistics (Cohen d) with corresponding 90% confidence intervals were used to describe between-groups differences in the component movement scores. The statistical significance was set a priori at P < .05.  Results:   There were significant between-groups differences for all component movements (P < .05). Post hoc testing revealed that older, more mature subjects possessed greater competency in all movements except the overhead squat. The effect sizes revealed predominantly moderate to very large differences in competency between the senior and junior groups (range of d [90% confidence interval]: 0.70 [0.06 to 1.30] to 3.01 [2.18 to 3.72]), with unclear to moderate differences found when comparing the 3 junior groups (0.08 [-0.50 to 0.65] to 0.97 [0.22-1.61]).  Conclusions:   The findings suggest that biological maturation may be associated with changes in athletic movement competency in youth Australian Rules football players. Therefore, it is recommended that strength and conditioning coaches monitor maturity status when working with 12- to 15-y-old players. This can allow for a comparison of an individual's athletic movement competency to maturity-based standards and help guide developmentally appropriate training programs.""","""['Daniel K Rogers', 'Ian McKeown', 'Gaynor Parfitt', 'Darren Burgess', 'Roger G Eston']""","""[]""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Int J Sports Physiol Perform""","""['A Comparison of Athletic Movement Among Talent-Identified Juniors From Different Football Codes in Australia: Implications for Talent Development.', 'Inter- and Intra-rater Reliability of the Athletic Ability Assessment in Subelite Australian Rules Football Players.', 'Discriminating Talent Identified Junior Australian Footballers Using a Fundamental Gross Athletic Movement Assessment.', 'Match analysis and the physiological demands of Australian football.', 'Science of rugby league football: a review.']"""

This retrospective study was performed with 250 patients and 215 healthy volunteers who were followed up in the neurology outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of migraine. Hematological parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), NLR, PLR, LMR, NMR ratios were compared in the patient and control groups. Patients with migraine were grouped according to loss of function, the severity of pain and aura. 20.8% of patients in the mean age of 36.37 ± 8.683 had migraine with aura. We found that NMR values in migraine with aura (MWA) were significantly higher than in the control group. CRP, PLR and NMR values in migraine without aura (MWOA) were significantly higher than in the control group. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet values were higher in patients with MWA and MWOA compared to the control group but did not show a statistically significant difference.

Objective:   To test the effects of receipt of a paper-based mammography screening decision aid (DA) for women 75 years and older on their screening decisions.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cluster randomized clinical trial with clinician as the unit of randomization. All analyses were completed on an intent-to-treat basis. The setting was 11 primary care practices in Massachusetts or North Carolina. Of 1247 eligible women reached, 546 aged 75 to 89 years without breast cancer or dementia who had a mammogram within 24 months but not within 6 months and saw 1 of 137 clinicians (herein referred to as PCPs) from November 3, 2014, to January 26, 2017, participated. A research assistant (RA) administered a previsit questionnaire on each participant's health, breast cancer risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and screening intentions. After the visit, the RA administered a postvisit questionnaire on screening intentions and knowledge.  Interventions:   Receipt of the DA (DA arm) or a home safety (HS) pamphlet (control arm) before a PCP visit.  Main outcomes and measures:   Participants were followed up for 18 months for receipt of mammography screening (primary outcome). To examine the effects of the DA, marginal logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations to allow for clustering by PCP. Adjusted probabilities and risk differences were estimated to account for clustering by PCP.  Results:   Of 546 women in the study, 283 (51.8%) received the DA. Patients in each arm were well matched; their mean (SD) age was 79.8 (3.7) years, 428 (78.4%) were non-Hispanic white, 321 (of 543 [59.1%]) had completed college, and 192 (35.2%) had less than a 10-year life expectancy. After 18 months, 9.1% (95% CI, 1.2%-16.9%) fewer women in the DA arm than in the control arm had undergone mammography screening (51.3% vs 60.4%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95; P = .006). Women in the DA arm were more likely than those in the control arm to rate their screening intentions lower from previsit to postvisit (69 of 283 [adjusted %, 24.5%] vs 47 of 263 [adjusted %, 15.3%]), to be more knowledgeable about the benefits and harms of screening (86 [adjusted %, 25.5%] vs 32 [adjusted %, 11.7%]), and to have a documented discussion about mammography with their PCP (146 [adjusted %, 47.4%] vs 111 [adjusted %, 38.9%]). Almost all women in the DA arm (94.9%) would recommend the DA.  Conclusions and relevance:   Providing women 75 years and older with a mammography screening DA before a PCP visit helps them make more informed screening decisions and leads to fewer women choosing to be screened, suggesting that the DA may help reduce overscreening.

This is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications, which may be influenced by inguinal drain management. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a new surgical technique regarding drain management with an inguinoperitoneal drainage.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 21 vulvar cancer patients with inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy was conducted. A silicone drain was circularly placed with the perforated end in the groin and the other end in the space of Douglas. The removal after 3 months was performed under local anesthesia. All patients were questioned during clinical follow-up regarding their personal experiences with the procedure, the occurrence of complications, and side effects using a clinical questionnaire.  Results:   In 100% of the patients, the procedure was feasible. Regarding the number of groin punctures due to lymphocyst formation, 15 (71.4%) patients did not need any intervention and 3 (14.3%) patients needed 1-3 punctures. The patient satisfaction with the internal drainage was ranked as good by 17 (81.0%) patients and as moderate by 1 (4.8%) patient. In 3 (14.3%) patients, information about the number of groin punctures and the patient satisfaction were missing.

This study was undertaken to define the character of childhood renal artery stenoses. A better understanding of this disease is particularly germane, given its unknown etiology and the limited success of certain contemporary treatment options.  Methods:   Renal artery specimens obtained during open operations in children being treated for renovascular hypertension from 2004 to 2016 were studied. Excluded from study were arteries subjected to earlier open or endovascular operations. Histologic preparations employing hematoxylin-eosin, Movat, Masson trichrome, and Verhoeff-van Gieson stains allowed characterization of the intima, media, and adventitial tissues. External and luminal diameters were measured. Microscopic data were correlated with preoperative arteriographic images. The histologic and morphologic findings were assessed in regard to coexistent nonrenal arterial and aortic lesions as well as known syndromic diseases.  Results:   Thirty-three stenotic renal arteries from 28 children were subjected to examination. Stenoses involved the proximal-ostial renal arteries (24), central renal arteries (7), and distal segmental renal arteries (2). Ostial stenoses commonly exhibited preocclusive concentric hyperplasia of intimal tissues, frequent internal elastic lamina disruptions, and diminutive and discontinuous media. Central and distal renal stenoses most often exhibited lesser intimal cellular hyperplasia and more noticeable fibrodysplasia of the media and adventitia. The mean external and luminal diameters of the renal arteries having ostial stenoses were smaller than the expected renal artery size for a given age. Abdominal aortic coarctation or hypoplastic aortas occurred in 14 children. Neurofibromatosis type 1 affected four children with ostial renal artery disease and one child with midrenal artery disease, but there were no distinguishing features unique to their stenoses.  Conclusions:   Pediatric renal artery stenotic disease affects exceedingly small arteries. Ostial lesions frequently exhibit extensive luminal encroachments characterized by cellular hyperplasia of intimal tissues and scant medial smooth muscle. Central and distal renal arterial stenoses were characterized most often by extensive fibrodysplasia of the media and adventitia. The early success and durability of catheter-based angioplasty may be compromised by the cellular abnormalities of pediatric renal artery occlusive disease observed in this investigation.""","""['Dawn M Coleman', 'Amer Heider', 'David Gordon', 'Santhi K Ganesh', 'Jonathan L Eliason', 'James C Stanley']""","""[' Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.

The current research is novel in examining the fine-grained associations of childhood emotional versus physical versus sexual maltreatment to indices of the severity, course, and presence of anxiety and trauma-related psychopathology in depression. An amalgamation across 6 previous investigations resulted in a sample of 575 adolescents and adults (76% female; age range 12-70, M = 27.88, SD = 13.58). All participants were in a current episode of a unipolar depressive disorder. Retrospective reports of childhood maltreatment were assessed using a rigorous contextual interview with independent, standardized ratings. Higher levels of emotional maltreatment and/or sexual maltreatment emerged as significantly associated with greater depression severity, number of previous episodes, and risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and were significantly more strongly associated with these characteristics than was physical maltreatment. Further, emotional maltreatment perpetrated by mothers was significantly associated with depression severity and history, whereas emotional maltreatment perpetrated by fathers was significantly associated with a greater risk of PTSD. These latter results suggest that prevention and intervention efforts may need to focus on the unique roles of mothers versus fathers on the development of depressive- versus threat-related psychopathology, respectively.

Methods:   We performed a case series study of 40 transmasculine patients who underwent gender-affirming vaginectomy and colpocleisis. Vaginectomy was performed by complete excision of the vaginal mucosa via a transperineal approach. We recorded perioperative outcomes and operative time.

Perioperative complications included 2 blood transfusions, 1 pelvic hematoma, and 1 Clostridium cifficile colitis. No urethral fistulae to the vaginal space, mucoceles, or visceral injures were seen with a median follow-up of 7.7 months. Operative time decreased significantly with later surgery year.  Conclusions:   This is a large series studying the outcomes of gender-affirming vaginectomy by complete mucosal excision approach in the literature. Perioperative complications were low.

Treatment for and prevention of VTE involves anti-thrombotic agents; more specifically, medications targeting the anticoagulation cascade. In spite of the widespread acceptance of anticoagulants in the treatment of VTE, there appears to be an ongoing belief that platelet reactivity contributes to thrombus burden in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This investigation of 398 patients presenting with acute PE evaluated whether anti-platelet medication use, which consisted mostly of aspirin therapy, at the time of presentation, affects PA thrombus burden, RV load, or short-term patient outcomes.

Extant work with cigarette smokers who also use SLT is based heavily on retrospective reports and between-group comparisons. The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the patterns of dual users' product use and nicotine exposure on days when cigarettes were smoked exclusively (single use) versus concurrently with SLT (dual use).  Design:   Forty-six dual cigarette-SLT users recorded their product use in real time via ecological momentary assessment for a 2-week longitudinal design. They responded to questions about situational factors (eg, location, mood) using this same diary, and collected saliva samples each night for later cotinine measurement. At the end of this 2-week period, users reported on their reasons for and beliefs about SLT use.  Results:   Cotinine levels were significantly higher on dual versus single use days (mean±SEM=374.48±41.08 ng/mL vs 300.17±28.13 ng/mL, respectively; p<0.01), and the number of cigarettes logged was higher on dual versus single use days (11.13±0.98 vs 9.13±1.11, respectively; p<0.01). Product use was distinguished by situational factors, with the strongest predictor being location of use. Moreover, the most common reason for initiating (56.52%) and continuing (67.39%) SLT use was to circumvent indoor smoking restrictions.  Conclusions:   Results support the idea of product supplementation rather than replacement among this convenience sample of dual users. For smokers whose primary motivation for SLT use involves situations where they would otherwise be tobacco free, the potential benefits of clean indoor air laws may be diminished.""","""['Nicholas J Felicione', 'Jenny E Ozga-Hess', 'Stuart G Ferguson', 'Geri Dino', 'Summer Kuhn', 'Ilana Haliwa', 'Melissa D Blank']""","""[' Psychology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' School of Medicine, University of Tasmania Faculty of Health, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', ' Social and Behavioral Sciences, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' WV Prevention Research Center, West Virginia University School of Public Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' Health Sciences and Technology Academy, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', ' Psychology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA mdblank@mail.wvu.edu.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Tob Control""","""['Examining the Transitions Between Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Product Use in the United States Using the 2002-2003 and 2010-2011 Longitudinal Cohorts.', 'Biomarkers of Exposure among Adult Smokeless Tobacco Users in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (Wave 1, 2013-2014).', 'Smokeless tobacco mortality risks: an analysis of two contemporary nationally representative longitudinal mortality studies.', 'How do consumers perceive differences in risk across nicotine products?

Whether clozapine might be associated with haematologic malignancies is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between haematologic malignancies and clozapine using Vigibase®, the WHO pharmacovigilance database.  Methods:   We performed a disproportionality analysis to compute reporting odds-ratio adjusted for age, sex and concurrent reporting of antineoplastic/immunomodulating agents (aROR) for clozapine and structurally related drugs (loxapine, olanzapine and quetiapine) compared with other antipsychotic drugs. Cases were malignant lymphoma and leukaemia reports. Non-cases were all other reports including at least one antipsychotic report.  Results:   Of the 140 226 clozapine-associated reports, 493 were malignant lymphoma cases, and 275 were leukaemia cases. Clozapine was significantly associated with malignant lymphoma (aROR 9.14, 95% CI 7.75-10.77) and leukaemia (aROR 3.54, 95% CI 2.97-4.22). Patients suffering from those haematologic malignancies were significantly younger in the clozapine treatment group than patients treated with other medicines (p < 0.001). The median time to onset (available for 212 cases) was 5.1 years (IQR 2.2-9.9) for malignant lymphoma and 2.5 years (IQR 0.6-7.4) for leukaemia. The aROR by quartile of dose of clozapine in patients with haematologic malignancies suggested a dose-dependent association.

While strong cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers should cause a clinically relevant modification in plasma TKI concentrations, the effect of weak inhibitors is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between weak P-PK-DDI and clinically relevant toxicity in real life.  Patients and methods:   This was a single-center retrospective study including patients treated with sunitinib or pazopanib for any malignancies, for whom a PK-DDI analysis was performed before starting TKI. The primary endpoint was the correlation between P-PK-DDIs and a dose decrease after 1 month of treatment. The secondary endpoint was the correlation between PK-DDIs and drug withdrawal due to toxicity.  Results:   Seventy-six patients were assessed. A P-PK-DDI with weak CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibition was found in 14 patients. In patients with P-PK-DDI or without, the dose was reduced during the first month in 57.1% and 17.7% (p = 0.003) and the drug withdrawn in 42.8% and 11.3% (p = 0.011), respectively. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation was found between P-PK-DDI (CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors) and dose reduction, and between drug withdrawal and PK-DDI (CYP3A4 inhibitors).  Conclusion:   P-PK-DDI was correlated with dose reduction and drug withdrawal due to toxicity.

Dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging requires injection of contrast, whereas computed tomography perfusion requires high doses of ionizing radiation. The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm for assisting the selection of suitable patients with acute ischemic stroke for endovascular treatment based on 3-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). Methods- A total of 167 image sets of 3-dimensional pCASL data from 137 patients with acute ischemic stroke scanned on 1.5T and 3.0T Siemens MR systems were included for neural network training. The concurrently acquired dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging was used to produce labels of hypoperfused brain regions, analyzed using commercial software. The DL and 6 machine learning (ML) algorithms were trained with 10-fold cross-validation. The eligibility for endovascular treatment was determined retrospectively based on the criteria of perfusion/diffusion mismatch in the DEFUSE 3 trial (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke). The trained DL algorithm was further applied on twelve 3-dimensional pCASL data sets acquired on 1.5T and 3T General Electric MR systems, without fine-tuning of parameters. Results- The DL algorithm can predict the dynamic susceptibility contrast-defined hypoperfusion region in pCASL with a voxel-wise area under the curve of 0.958, while the 6 ML algorithms ranged from 0.897 to 0.933. For retrospective determination for subject-level endovascular treatment eligibility, the DL algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92%, with a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.95. When applied to the GE pCASL data, the DL algorithm achieved a voxel-wise area under the curve of 0.94 and a subject-level accuracy of 92% for endovascular treatment eligibility. Conclusions- pCASL perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with the DL algorithm provides a promising approach for assisting decision-making for endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke.""","""['Kai Wang', 'Qinyang Shou', 'Samantha J Ma', 'David Liebeskind', 'Xin J Qiao', 'Jeffrey Saver', 'Noriko Salamon', 'Hosung Kim', 'Yannan Yu', 'Yuan Xie', 'Greg Zaharchuk', 'Fabien Scalzo', 'Danny J J Wang']""","""[' From the Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles (K.W., Q.S., S.J.M., H.K., D.J.J.W.).', ' Department of Neurology (D.L., J.S., F.S.), University of California, Los Angeles.', ' Department of Radiology (X.J.Q., N.S.), University of California, Los Angeles.', ' Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA (Y.Y., Y.X., G.Z.).']""","""2020""","""2020 Feb""","""Stroke""","""['Distinctive Patterns of Three-Dimensional Arterial Spin-Labeled Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Subtypes of Acute Ischemic Stroke.', 'Multi-parameter arterial spin labeling versus dynamic magnetic-sensitive enhanced cerebral perfusion imaging for diagnosis of transient cerebral ischemic attack.', 'Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Performed in Acute Perinatal Stroke Reveals Hyperperfusion Associated With Ischemic Injury.', 'Extension of therapeutic window in ischemic stroke by selective mismatch imaging.', 'Arterial spin labeling compared to dynamic susceptibility contrast MR perfusion imaging for assessment of ischemic penumbra: A systematic review.', 'Predicting Hypoperfusion Lesion and Target Mismatch in Stroke from Diffusion-weighted MRI Using Deep Learning.', 'A deep learning-based model for prediction of hemorrhagic transformation after stroke.']"""

Fifty-five paired CBCT and CT images from HN patients were retrospectively analysed. Among them, 15 patients underwent adaptive replanning during treatment, thus had same-day CT/CBCT pairs. The remaining 40 patients (post-operative) had paired planning CT and 1st fraction CBCT images with minimal anatomic changes. A 2D U-Net architecture with 27-layers in 5 depths was built for the CNN. CNN training was performed using data from 40 post-operative HN patients with 2080 paired CT/CBCT slices. Validation and test datasets include 5 same-day datasets with 260 slice pairs and 10 same-day datasets with 520 slice pairs, respectively. To examine the impact of differences in training dataset selection and network performance as a function of training data size, additional networks were trained using 30, 40 and 50 datasets. Image quality of enhanced CBCT images were quantitatively compared against the CT image using mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield units (HU), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). Enhanced CBCT images reduced artifact distortion and improved soft tissue contrast. Networks trained with 40 datasets had imaging performance comparable to those trained with 50 datasets and outperformed those trained with 30 datasets. Comparison of CBCT and enhanced CBCT images demonstrated improvement in average MAE from 172.73 to 49.28 HU, SNR from 8.27 to 14.25 dB, and SSIM from 0.42 to 0.85. The image processing time is 2 s per patient using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.

Studies investigating patients with NTM-PD and multiple culture-negative sputum samples but culture-positive bronchoscopic samples are lacking. We investigated the clinical characteristics, outcome, and predictors of radiographic progression in this special population.  Methods:   Patients with negative NTM culture from ≥2 expectorated sputum samples within the 3 months prior to bronchoscopy diagnosis of NTM-PD between 2009 and 2017 were included. Patient characteristics and clinical course were described. Predictors for radiographic progression of NTM-PD within 2 years were analysed by using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Among 66 patients with bronchoscopy-diagnosed NTM-PD, radiographic progression occurred within 2 years in 17 (26%). Of the 60 patients not initially treated, radiographic progression occurred in 17 (28%). Among them, 10 never received treatment, with 6 deteriorating and 3 dying. Of the 6 and 7 patients who received treatment immediately after NTM-PD diagnosis and after radiographic progression, respectively, none had further radiographic progression. The independent predictors of radiographic progression were male sex, body mass index <18.5 kg/m2, use of inhaled corticosteroids, and acid-fast smear grade ≥2 of index bronchoscopic samples.  Conclusions:   Among patients with bronchoscopy-diagnosed NTM-PD, one fourth experienced radiographic progression within 2 years.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients who presented to our institution with a ruptured AVM.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent prolapse surgery and had preoperative UDS between June 2010 and February 2015. Indications for UDS were classified into four categories: (1) occult stress urinary incontinence only, (2) overactive bladder symptoms, (3) mixed or insensible urinary incontinence, and (4) voiding symptoms and/or elevated post-void residual. We identified changes in management or counseling that were directly attributable to UDS results prior to surgery.  Results:   Three hundred ninety-two patients underwent urodynamic testing for indications 2-4 above, and 316 met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven percent (180/316) had OAB symptoms (34.4% wet, 65.6% dry), 40.2% (127/316) had mixed incontinence, and 17.1% (54/316) had voiding symptoms and/or elevated PVR.

Our purpose was to quantify the prevalence of preoperative yoga participation and characterize subsequent ability to return to yoga in patients undergoing volar locked plating of distal radius fractures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of distal radius open reduction internal fixation between August 2015 and March 2017. Patients were included if they were treated with volar locked plating and if they participated in yoga on a regular basis preoperatively. Patients were contacted at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively and surveyed about yoga participation. Results: A total of 149 patients who underwent distal radius volar plating were surveyed. Thirty-one patients (32 procedures, 20.8% of surveyed patients) participated in yoga on a regular basis preoperatively. Overall, 90.3% returned to yoga in some capacity. Mean times to return to yoga in any capacity, with weight-bearing, and in a ""steady state"" were 5.7, 7.4, and 10.0 months, respectively. Of patients who resumed yoga, 65.5% returned to the same or better level of yoga. Satisfaction with participation in yoga was 8.9 (out of 10).

Initial treatment includes corticosteroid injections. Injections can be performed with image guidance to assist with placement; however, the clinical benefits are unclear. Methods: This retrospective study used Truven Health Marketscan Research Databases to identify patients from 2003 to 2014 with common International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for osteoarthritis of the CMC joint, Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for image and non-image-guided injections, and codes for surgical interventions. Length of time from injection until subsequent injection(s) and/or surgery was extrapolated for identified patients. Analysis of variance and binomial logistic regression were used to compare continuous variables and calculate odds ratios, respectively. Results: We identified 62 333 patients (68% women, 32% men), average age 59.7, with common ICD-9 diagnostic codes for CMC arthritis with respective injection CPT codes. The average number of days between the first and second injection for patients treated with non-guided injection was 237.3 versus 266.7 for image-guided injections. Of the 62333 patients, 8107 went on to operative treatment. Among operative patients, the average number of days to surgery following non-guided injection was 317.7 versus 333.7 days in the image-guided group. The average cost of performing non-image-guided injections was $203 less than using ultrasound. Conclusions: Image-guided thumb CMC injections do not result in significant increases in time between injections and do not lead to a meaningful delay to surgery. Future research needs to clarify the value of image-guided CMC injections in an increasingly economically conscientious health care environment.""","""['Grigory E Gershkovich', 'Haroutioun Boyadjian', 'Megan Conti Mica']""","""[' The University of Chicago Medicine & Biological Sciences, IL, USA.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Hand (N Y)""","""['The effect of ultrasound guided steroid injection on progression to surgery in thumb CMC arthritis.', 'Thumb Carpometacarpal Arthritis: Prognostic Indicators and Timing of Further Intervention Following Corticosteroid Injection.', 'Risk of Infection in Thumb Carpometacarpal Surgery After Corticosteroid Injection.', 'Risk Factors for Failed Nonsurgical Treatment Resulting in Surgery on Thumb Carpometacarpal Arthritis.', 'Thumb carpometacarpal arthritis.', 'Value of imaging to guide interventional procedures in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: a systematic literature review informing EULAR points to consider.']"""

Spikes frequently co-occur across multiple brain regions with discernable latencies, suggesting that spikes can propagate through distributed neural networks. The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term reproducibility of spike propagation patterns over hours to days of interictal recording.  Methods:   Twelve children (mean age 13.1 years) were retrospectively studied. A mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 47.2 ± 40.1 hours of interictal EEG recordings were examined per patient (range 17.5-166.5 hours). Interictal recordings were divided into 30-minute segments. Networks were extracted based on the frequency of spike coactivation between pairs of electrodes. For each 30-minute segment, electrodes were assigned a ""Degree Preference (DP)"" based on the tendency to appear upstream or downstream within propagation sequences. The consistency of DPs across segments (""DP-Stability"") was quantified using the Spearman rank correlation.  Results:   Regions exhibited highly stable preferences to appear upstream, intermediate, or downstream in spike propagation sequences. Across networks, the mean ± SD DP-Stability was 0.88 ± 0.07, indicating that propagation patterns observed in 30-minute segments were representative of the patterns observed in the full interictal window. At the group level, regions involved in seizure generation appeared more upstream in spike propagation sequences.  Significance:   Interictal spike propagation is a highly reproducible output of epileptic networks.

In the present study, we investigated the clinical and molecular features of thalamic gliomas in Chinese patients.  Methods:   The data from 26 patients with thalamic glioma who had undergone surgery at Shanghai Huashan Hospital from January 2011 to August 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Various clinical and molecular factors were evaluated to explore their effects on prognosis. H3K27M mutation status and its association with relevant molecular factors were also investigated.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 38.88 years, and no significant difference was found in sex. The most common initial symptoms were headaches (38.46%; 10 of 26) and motor deficits (30.77%; 8 of 26). The H3K27M mutation was identified in 12 patients, and mutant thalamic glioma showed less frequent O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation compared with the wild-type group (P = 0.015; χ1 test). Multivariate analysis showed that the H3K27M mutation was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival.

Subject population:   IN all, 112 pediatric patients, aged 9.96 ± 4.59 years, with craniopharyngioma from 2006-2011 scanned annually.  Field strength/sequence:   1.5T and 3T TOF MRA.  Statistical tests:   Chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.  Assessment:   Manual measurements using interventional angiography was established as a reference standard for diameter measurements. Constant and linear quantile regression with absolute difference, percentage difference, and relative difference was used for outlier detection.  Results:   Major vessels surrounding the circle of Willis were successfully segmented except for posterior communicating arteries, mostly due to disease-related hypoplasia. Diameter measurements were calculated at 1-mm segments with a median computed vessel diameter of 1.25 mm. Diameter distortion due to registration was within 0.04 mm for 99% of vessel segments. Outlier detection using quantile regression detected less than 4.34% as being outliers. Outliers were more frequent in smaller vessels and proximity to bifurcations (P < 0.001).

We investigated coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude to better understand the mechanisms that generate this type of pathologic ripple (pRipple) event.  Methods:   We quantified phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) spike phase and ripple amplitude recorded from intracranial depth macroelectrodes during episodes of sleep in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. PAC was determined by (1) a phasor transform that corresponds to the strength and rate of ripples coupled with spikes, and a (2) ripple-triggered average to measure the strength, morphology, and spectral frequency of the modulating and modulated signals. Coupling strength was evaluated in relation to recording sites within and outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ).  Results:   Both the phasor transform and ripple-triggered averaging methods showed that ripple amplitude was often robustly coupled with epileptiform EEG spike phase. Coupling was found more regularly inside than outside the SOZ, and coupling strength correlated with the likelihood a macroelectrode's location was within the SOZ (p < 0.01). The ratio of the rate of ripples coupled with EEG spikes inside the SOZ to rates of coupled ripples in non-SOZ was greater than the ratio of rates of ripples on spikes detected irrespective of coupling (p < 0.05). Coupling strength correlated with an increase in mean normalized ripple amplitude (p < 0.01), and a decrease in mean ripple spectral frequency (p < 0.05).  Significance:   Generation of low-frequency (80-150 Hz) pRipples in the SOZ involves coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude.

Methods:   Wide bandwidth local field potential recordings were acquired from microelectrodes implanted in mesial temporal structures during spontaneous seizures from six patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.  Results:   In the seizure onset zone, distinct epileptiform discharges were evident in the local field potential prior to the time of seizure onset in the intracranial EEG. In all three seizures with hypersynchronous (HYP) seizure onset, fast ripples with incrementally increasing power accompanied epileptiform discharges during the transition to the ictal state (p < 0.01). In a single low voltage fast (LVF) onset seizure a triad of evolving HYP LFP discharges, increased single unit activity, and fast ripples of incrementally increasing power were identified ~20 s prior to seizure onset (p < 0.01). In addition, incrementally increasing fast ripples occurred after seizure onset just prior to the transition to LVF activity (p < 0.01). HYP onset was associated with an increase in fast ripple and ripple rate (p < 0.05) and commonly each HYP discharge had a superimposed ripple followed by a fast ripple. Putative excitatory and inhibitory single units could be distinguished during limbic seizure onset, and heterogeneous shifts in firing rate were observed during LVF activity.  Significance:   Epileptiform activity is detected by microelectrodes before it is detected by depth macroelectrodes, and the one clinically identified LVF ictal onset was a HYP onset at the local level.

As the aetiologies of olfactory dysfunction vary greatly so do the treatment approaches. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate treatment with systemic corticosteroids, particularly focusing on its effectiveness on the different olfactory dysfunction aetiologies. Although a prospective randomized control trail is preferred for such an investigation, using the current approach, we were able to test a very large patient population.  Material and methods:   A total of 425 patients with olfactory dysfunction were treated with systemic corticosteroids for 14 days. Olfactory performance was measured using the `Sniffin` Sticks` battery before and after the treatment.  Results:   The treatment with systemic corticosteroids significantly increased the performance on the TDI score and on each of the three subtests; threshold, discrimination and identification. In 26.6% of the patients improvement of more than six points of the TDI score was observed. The treatment proved to be more effective in patients with sinunasal olfactory dysfunction, where this percentage increased to 36.7, compared to other aetiologies. In addition, the increase in olfactory function was negatively correlated with the TDI score before the treatment.  Conclusion:   This study confirms the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids on olfactory dysfunction in a large patient population. Specifically, the results show that treatment is: (a) more effective in patients with sinunasal than in patients with idiopathic olfactory dysfunction, (b) most effective in patients with sinunasal disease with nasal polyps, and (c), at best, effective in half of the patients.

Methods:   We examined the expression levels of ERβ, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in 42 initial non-muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinomas via immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis was performed among ERβ expression, cadherin switch, and recurrence-free survival. Moreover, in vitro studies were performed to validate the identified correlation using two bladder cancer cell lines RT4 and 253 J. Upon stimulation with an ERβ-selective agonist diarylpropionitrile, E-cadherin, N-cadherin expressions; cell migration, and invasion capacity were assessed.  Results:   Expression of ERβ protein was seen in 34 bladder cancer cases (80.9%), and 21 (50%) specimens showed non-cadherin switch (positive E-cadherin and negative N-cadherin). ERβ expression and the non-cadherin switch are both accompanied with better recurrence-free survival. Also, the least ERβ expression was observed in specimens that undergo cadherin switch. Moreover, these results were consistent with our observations in bladder cancer RT4 and 253 J cell lines studies. Diarylpropionitrile stimulation resulted in an increase in E-cadherin, a decrease in N-cadherin expressions and abolished cell migration and invasion.  Conclusion:   ERβ is a prognostic marker of recurrence-free rate in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, potentially through suppressing cadherin switch, and may act as a potential target for bladder cancer therapy.""","""['Bangmin Han', 'Di Cui', 'Yifeng Jing', 'Yan Hong', 'Shujie Xia']""","""["" Department of Urology, School of Medicine, The First People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2012""","""2012 Dec""","""World J Urol""","""['Erratum to: Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is a novel prognostic marker of recurrence survival in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer potentially by inhibiting cadherin switch.', 'Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is a novel prognostic marker of recurrence survival in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer potentially by inhibiting cadherin switch.', 'Estrogen receptor-β expression and pharmacological targeting in bladder cancer.', 'Expression profile of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer as a novel predictor of intravesical recurrence following transurethral resection.', 'Expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins and their prognostic value in superficial low-grade urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Analysis of N-E cadherin switch as an independent predictive parameter of bladder cancer survival outcomes.', 'Clinicopathological Significance of Estrogen Receptor β and Estrogen Synthesizing/Metabolizing Enzymes in Urothelial Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder.', 'Sex Hormone Receptor Signaling in Bladder Cancer: A Potential Target for Enhancing the Efficacy of Conventional Non-Surgical Therapy.', 'The Role of Estrogen Receptors in Urothelial Cancer.', 'The effect of tumor location on overall survival for pT2-4 bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma following radical surgery.', 'Progression of urothelial carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder: a switch from luminal to basal phenotype and related therapeutic implications.']"""

Failure to diagnose anemia leads to delayed treatment and thus delayed relief of symptoms. Given the potentially significant impact of anemia on cardiovascular disease and physical performance among older nursing home (NH) residents, it is important to evaluate current clinical practice related to anemia.The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to evaluate the frequency of laboratory evaluation and medication treatment for anemia among older NH residents. Results indicated that more than half of NH residents were anemic at baseline, and of those, less than 20% had additional testing done to further evaluate for an underlying cause of their anemia and only 45.3% received any pharmacologic treatment. Future research is needed to clarify the potential benefits of timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment for anemic older adults in long-term-care settings and establish evidence-based guidelines to direct care in this area.""","""['Valerie K Sabol', 'Barbara Resnick', 'Elizabeth Galik', 'Ann L Gruber-Baldini', 'Patricia Gonce Morton', 'Gregory E Hicks']""","""[' Organizational Systems and Adult Health, University of Maryland School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD 21201-1579, USA. sabol@son.umaryland.edu']""","""2010""","""2010 Jun""","""West J Nurs Res""","""['Falls in nursing home residents receiving pharmacotherapy for anemia.', 'Anemia and its impact on function in nursing home residents: what do we know?', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'The impact of anemia on nursing home residents.', 'Assessing the quality of prescribing and monitoring erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the nursing home setting.']"""

Methods:   In a retrospective consecutive clinical study with historical controls, 68 patients were discharged from our center with functioning grafts between September 1995 and December 1997. Patients received steroid-free immunosuppression using an initial 10-day antithymocyte globulin induction and maintenance therapy with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). No steroids were given.  Results:   After an observation for up to 2.5 years (median 488 days, range 127 to 945 days), 66 patients (one died from sepsis after 6 months, and one died of peritonitis after returning to dialysis) were alive and well. Sixty-four grafts were functioning well, hemolytic uremic syndrome recurred in one graft, one graft had to be removed for noncompliance, and two patients returned to dialysis after chronic rejection-one after 8 months (the patient who died in peritoneal dialysis) and one (a third graft in an antibody-positive patient) 16 months after transplantation. We observed only 10 acute rejections (15%), a rate significantly lower (P=0.0006) than the 71 acute rejections observed in 190 previous consecutive transplants (37.4%) treated without MMF but otherwise after exactly the same protocol. In further comparison, the MMF-treated group also showed an equivalent (P=NS) rate of cytomegalovirus infections and a lower rate (P<0.00005) of Epstein-Barr virus infections. Graft function was excellent (median serum creatinine below 200 micromol/L at 1 year), and no malignancies were observed in the MMF-treated patients. Side effects were mainly leukopenia and two gastrointestinal disturbances.  Conclusions:   Our first-line, steroid-free immunosuppressive protocol allows initial graft function, provides a safe level of long-term graft survival and function with a very low rejection rate, gives an acceptable rate of side effects, and possesses the potential for lowering the incidence of chronic rejection over the long-term. Compared with protocols that discontinue steroids after the initial posttransplant period, a steroid-free protocol avoids the increased risk of infection and body disfigurement in the early posttransplant period. It also avoids the long-term risks of steroid use and the increased risks of rejection when the steroids are withdrawn.""","""['S A Birkeland']""","""[' Department of Nephrology, Odense University, Denmark.
