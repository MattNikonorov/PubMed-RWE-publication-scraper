Recruiting a large number of subjects requires longer time and higher costs. Furthermore, vaccine developers are more than ever facing the need to accelerate vaccine development to fulfill the public's medical needs. A possible approach to accelerate development is to use the method of dynamic borrowing of historical controls in clinical trials. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility and the performance of this approach in vaccine development by retrospectively analyzing two real vaccine studies: a relatively small immunological trial (typical early phase study) and a large vaccine efficacy trial (typical Phase 3 study) assessing prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccine. Results are promising, particularly for early development immunological studies, where the adaptive design is feasible, and control of type I error is less relevant.""","""['Andrea Callegaro', 'Naveen Karkada', 'Emmanuel Aris', 'Toufik Zahaf']""","""[' Department of Biostatistics, GSK, Rixensart, Belgium.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Pharm Stat""","""['Critical appraisal of Bayesian dynamic borrowing from an imperfectly commensurate historical control.', 'Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing of Historical Information with Applications to the Analysis of Large-Scale Assessments.', 'Use of historical control data for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials.', 'Innovative trial designs and analyses for vaccine clinical development.', 'Leveraging historical data into oncology development programs: Two case studies of phase 2 Bayesian augmented control trial designs.']"""

Methods:   In-vivo MRI (1.5 Tesla) scans of 30 fetuses, each including two axial and one coronal T2-weighted sequences of the whole lung with all other acquisition parameters kept constant, were retrospectively identified. Manual segmentation of the lungs was performed using ITK-Snap. One hundred radiomics features were extracted from fetal lung MRI data using Pyradiomics, resulting in 90 datasets. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of radiomics features were calculated between baseline and repeat axial acquisitions and between baseline axial and coronal acquisitions.  Results:   MRI data of 30 fetuses (12 [40%] females, 18 [60%] males) at a median gestational age of 24 + 5 gestational weeks plus days (GW) (interquartile range [IQR] 3 + 3 GW, range 21 + 1 to 32 + 6 GW) were included. Median ICC of radiomics features between baseline and repeat axial MR acquisitions was 0.92 (IQR 0.13, range 0.33 to 1), with 60 features exhibiting excellent (ICC > 0.9), 27 good (> 0.75-0.9), twelve moderate (0.5-0.75), and one poor (ICC < 0.5) reproducibility. Median ICC of radiomics features between baseline axial and coronal MR acquisitions was 0.79 (IQR 0.15, range 0.2 to 1), with 20 features exhibiting excellent, 47 good, 29 moderate, and four poor reproducibility.  Conclusion:   Standardized in-vivo fetal MRI allows reproducible extraction of lung radiomics features. In the future, radiomics analysis may improve diagnostic and prognostic yield of fetal MRI in normal and pathologic lung development.  Key points:   • Non-invasive fetal MRI acquired using a standardized protocol allows reproducible extraction of radiomics features from the developing lung for objective tissue characterization. • Alteration of imaging plane between fetal MRI acquisitions has a negative impact on lung radiomics feature reproducibility. • Fetal MRI radiomics features reflecting the microstructure and shape of the fetal lung could complement observed-to-expected lung volume in the prediction of postnatal outcome and optimal treatment of fetuses with abnormal lung development in the future.""","""['Florian Prayer', 'Martin L Watzenböck', 'Benedikt H Heidinger', 'Julian Rainer', 'Victor Schmidbauer', 'Helmut Prosch', 'Barbara Ulm', 'Erika Rubesova', 'Daniela Prayer', 'Gregor Kasprian']""","""[' Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', ' Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090, Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', "" Department of Pediatric Radiology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, Stanford University, 725 Welch Road, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA."", ' Imaging Bellaria, Bellariastrasse 3, 1010, Vienna, Austria.', ' Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090, Vienna, Austria. gregor.kasprian@meduniwien.ac.at.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Reproducibility of 2D versus 3D radiomics for quantitative assessment of fetal lung development: a retrospective fetal MRI study.', 'Reliability of MRI radiomics features in MR-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Repeatability, reproducibility, and within-subject agreement.', 'Sources of variation in multicenter rectal MRI data and their effect on radiomics feature reproducibility.', 'Precision of MRI radiomics features in the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Reproducibility of Lung and Liver Volume Measurements on Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Left-Sided Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia.']"""

Exome sequencing (ES) offers the possibility of extensive preconception carrier screening (PCS) in consanguineous couples who may be at risk of rare genetic disorders.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed ES data from 65 probands affected with rare genetic disorders born from consanguineous couples. We explored diagnostic yield and carrier status for recessive disorders.  Results:   The overall diagnostic yield in a singleton approach was 53.8%, mostly recessive variants. In a hypothetical exome-based PCS, only 11.7% of these causative rare variants would have been missed in the filtering process. Carrier screening for recessive conditions allowed the identification of at least one additional pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 85.7% of the probands, being the majority with a gene carrier frequency <1 in 200. In addition, considering only clinically actionable conditions, we estimated that 12.3% of our close consanguineous couples may be at risk for an additional recessive disease.

Understanding the factors that contribute to bullying and the prevalence of bullying victimisation may help to develop strategies to prevent bullying. Using a mixed-method approach, this study explored the perceptions and prevalence of bullying of South Asian immigrants living in Australia. Five focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to explore bullying experiences and to inform an online survey. The online survey included the California Bullying Victimisation Scale-Retrospective (CBVS-R) to measure prevalence, types, and places of bullying victimisation. Data collected from FGDs were thematically analysed while survey data were examined to identify factors associated with bullying. The main contributing factors reported by participants during FGDs were ethnic attire (clothing), religion, accent, workplace achievement, skin colour, and body shape. The online survey collected responses from 313 participants that included females (44%) and males (56%) with a mean age of 41.0 (SD ± 10.3) years. Almost 31% of participants surveyed experienced multiple bullying incidents per month with no differences observed between gender (32% in males, 31% in females). Males were mostly bullied (63%) in their workplaces while females were mostly bullied (56%) at bus or train stations. Country of birth, employment status, educational qualification, and English proficiency significantly associated with bullying experience (p < 0.001). These findings show that bullying affects male and female immigrants in different forms and settings; therefore, a large national assessment is needed to evaluate the magnitude of bullying and its consequences on immigrant health and well-being.""","""['Mehwish Nisar', 'Tracy L Kolbe-Alexander', 'Asaduzzaman Khan']""","""[' School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, 4072, Australia. m.nisar@uq.net.au.', ' School of Health and Medical Sciences, Centre for Health Research, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia.', ' Division of Exercise Science and Sports Medicine, Department of Human Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', ' School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, 4072, Australia.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Prev Sci""","""['Retrospective bullying trajectories in adults with self-reported oral language difficulties.', ""'Cost, culture and circumstances': Barriers and enablers of health behaviours in South Asian immigrants of Australia."", 'Prevalence of traditional bullying and cyberbullying among children and adolescents in Australia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Interventions for prevention of bullying in the workplace.', 'Annual Research Review: The persistent and pervasive impact of being bullied in childhood and adolescence: implications for policy and practice.']"""

The clinicopathological features were analyzed, and the correlation between GCP and the risk of lymph node metastasis was assessed. Data for 180 EGC patients were analyzed, and 17.8% (32/180) had LNM. The incidence of LNM was 2.6% in the GCP-positive group and 21.8% in the GCP-negative group. Univariate analysis revealed that GCP, depth of tumor invasion, and lymphovascular invasion were the risk factors of LNM in EGC patients. Multiple regression analysis showed that GCP was associated with the risk of LNM in EGC patients (OR=0.097, 0.121, 0.100, p<0.05). The curve fitting results showed that there was a negative correlation between the GCP and LNM in EGC, which was consistent between different tumor sites, size, ulceration, differentiation types, depth of tumor invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and no significant interaction was found among these factors (p for interaction range 0.224-0.717).

These dominant orientations do not change significantly even if the relative contributions from microscopic water pools to the net voxel signal vary across experiments that use different diffusion times, b-values, TEs, and TRs. With this in mind, we propose a practical new framework for imaging non-parametric diffusion tensor distributions (DTDs) by constraining the microscopic diffusion tensors of the DTD to be diagonalized using the same orthonormal reference frame of the mesoscopic voxel. In each voxel, the constrained DTD (cDTD) is completely determined by the correlation spectrum of the microscopic principal diffusivities associated with the axes of the voxel reference frame. Consequently, all cDTDs are inherently limited to the domain of positive definite tensors and can be reconstructed efficiently using Inverse Laplace Transform methods. Moreover, the cDTD reconstruction can be performed using only data acquired efficiently with single diffusion encoding, although it also supports datasets with multiple diffusion encoding. In tissues with a well-defined architecture, such as the cortex, we can further constrain the cDTD to contain only cylindrically symmetric diffusion tensors and measure the 2D correlation spectra of principal diffusivities along the radial and tangential orientation with respect to the cortical surface. To demonstrate this framework, we perform numerical simulations and analyze high-resolution dMRI data from a fixed macaque monkey brain. We estimate 2D cDTDs in the cortex and derive, in each voxel, the marginal distributions of the microscopic principal diffusivities, the corresponding distributions of the microscopic fractional anisotropies and mean diffusivities along with their 2D correlation spectra to quantify the cDTD shape-size characteristics. Signal components corresponding to specific bands in these cDTD-derived spectra show high specificity to cortical laminar structures observed with histology. Our framework drastically simplifies the measurement of non-parametric DTDs in high-resolution datasets with mesoscopic voxel sizes much smaller than the radius of curvature of the underlying anatomy, e.g., cortical surface, and can be applied retrospectively to analyze existing diffusion MRI data from fixed cortical tissues.""","""['Alexandru V Avram', 'Kadharbatcha S Saleem', 'Peter J Basser']""","""[' Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', ' Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, Bethesda, MD, United States.', ' Henry M.

Methods:   Data of patients aged 18 years and older, who visited ED of Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital during the study period and were diagnosed with upper GI bleeding, were obtained from the electronic-based hospital information system and analyzed retrospectively. Each scoring system was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.  Results:   The study was completed with 592 patients. The mean age of the patients was 63.5±19.0 years, and 68.6% were male. The total in-hospital mortality rate was 5.2%. In the ROC analysis of the AIMS65 and pre-endoscopy Rockall scores in the prediction of in-hospital mortality, the area under the curve values was calculated as 0.822 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.788-0.852) and 0.777 (95% CI: 0.741-0.810), respectively. When these two scoring systems were compared, neither had statistically significant superiority over the other in predicting in-hospital mortality.  Conclusion:   The AIMS65 and pre-endoscopy Rockall scores can be used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with GI bleeding.

AKI development in patients with AP increases mortality, morbidity, and the cost of treatment. Therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of AKI is important. The purpose of our study was to present biomarkers and case management of AKI developing in patients with AP.  Methods:   The participants of this retrospective study consisted of 582 patients who were followed up with the diagnosis of AP. Atlanta classification was used for the diagnosis and the identification of severity of AP. The laboratory values of patients at the time of first application to the emergency room were recorded. Blood tests were checked 48 h/l. Their blood tests were monitored daily until the day of discharge.  Results:   Of the 582 patients who were admitted with the AP diagnosis, 344 were female. AKI was detected in 147 patients (25.2%) of the patients admitted with AP diagnosis. The mean age of patients developing AKI was higher than those who did not develop AKI. The albumin and calcium levels in patients developing AKI were significantly lower than the group without AKI. The C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios were statistically significantly higher in the group with AKI than the group without AKI. The increase values in AST and ALT levels between the group with AKI and the group without AKI were not statistically significant. The mean leukocyte, CRP, procalcitonin levels, and immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) ratio were higher in patients with AKI in comparison to the patient group without AKI. The decrease in the lymphocyte, hematocrit, and platelet levels was higher in the patient group with AKI compared to the patient group without AKI. Urea and creatinine levels of the group with AKI at the time of admission were higher than the group without AKI. The clinical picture in 13 of the patients we followed up with AP diagnosis was mortal.  Conclusion:   The values of hematocrit, platelet, leukocyte, lymphocyte, albumin, CRP, CRP/albumin ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ration, IG%, procalcitonin, urea, and creatinine that were examined at the time of hospital admission can be useful biomarkers in predicting the development of AKI in patients with AP.

Liver resection (LR) seems to have a minimal role in the management of liver injury. However, surgical treatment becomes the only life-saving treatment in cases with severe liver trauma.  Methods:   It is a retrospective presentation of five cases with severe blunt liver injury whose were admitted at our center during the 8-year period.  Results:   The median age of patients was 30.8 (23-43). The most frequent mechanism of injury was pedestrian struck (60%). Two of five cases were transferred to our hospital from rural state hospitals after initial attempt to achieving hemostasis. The majority of liver injury was grade V (80%). The right lobe of the liver was injured in different extensions. Major vascular injury was associated to liver injury in four of five cases. The right hepatectomy (n=1), resectional debridement of segments 5, 6, and 7 (n=1), posterior sectorectomy (n=2), and segment 7 resection (n=1) were performed for hemostasis. Vascular injuries in the junction of inferior vena cava and right hepatic vein (n=1), the anterior surface of the right hepatic vein (n=1), the junction of segment 7 hepatic vein and right hepatic vein (n=1), the main portal vein (n=1), and the right renal vein (n=1) were repaired. Median operation time was 162 min (120-180 min). Operative mortality was 20%. Reoperation was needed in three of four survived cases. In-hospital complications were observed in two of four survived cases. Median stay in intensive care unit and hospital was 12.4 days (1-48 days) and 28.2 days (1-65 days), respectively.

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 55 patients who underwent primary THA performed at a single centre, using HXLPE liners with 36 mm cobalt-chrome heads in acetabular components with an outer diameter of 52 mm or smaller. Patient demographic details, implant details, death, and all-cause revisions were recorded. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival was used to determine all-cause and liner-specific revision. Of these 55 patients, 22 had a minimum radiological follow-up of seven years and were assessed radiologically for linear and volumetric wear.  Results:   Overall survival rate for all-cause revision was 94.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 81.7% to 97.2%) at a mean follow-up of 12.8 years (10.9 to 18.7). Three patients were revised, none for liner wear, fracture, or dissociation. A total of 22 patients were included in the radiological analysis (mean follow-up 9.9 years (7.5 to 13.7)). Mean linear liner wear was 0.085 mm (95% CI -0.086 to 0.257) and the volumetric wear rate was 11.097 mm3/year (95% CI -6.5 to 28.7).  Conclusion:   Using HXLPE liners with 36 mm heads in 52 mm acetabular components or smaller is safe, with excellent survival and low rates of linear and volumetric wear at medium-term follow-up. Patients did not require revision surgery for liner complications such as fracture, dissociation, or wear. Our results suggest that the advantages of using larger heads outweigh the potential risks of using thin HXLPE liners.Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2023;105-B(1):29-34.""","""['Bas L Fransen', 'Francisco J Bengoa', 'Michael E Neufeld', 'Gerard A Sheridan', 'Donald S Garbuz', 'Lisa C Howard']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedics, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Bone Joint J""","""['Fifteen-Year Results of Total Hip Arthroplasty With Cobalt-Chromium Femoral Heads on Highly Cross-Linked Polyethylene in Patients 50 Years and Less.', ""Highly cross-linked polyethylene decreases the rate of revision of total hip arthroplasty compared with conventional polyethylene at 13 years' follow-up."", ""Oxidized zirconium versus cobalt-chrome femoral heads in total hip arthroplasty: a multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial with ten years' follow-up."", 'History and systematic review of wear and osteolysis outcomes for first-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene.', 'Isolated Head and Liner Exchange in Revision Hip Arthroplasty.', 'Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene in Hip and Knee Arthroplasties.']"""

We performed a retrospective study using more than 100,000 records of patient appointments in a hospital outpatient clinic. Several machine learning algorithms were used for the development of our prediction models. We trained our models on a dataset that contained patients', physicians', and appointments' characteristics. Our feature set combines both unstudied features and features adopted from previous studies. In addition, we identified the influential features for predicting LOA and no-show. Our LOA model's performance was 6.92 in terms of MAE, and our no-show model's performance was 92.1% in terms of F-score. We compared our models' performance to the performance of previous research models by applying their methods to our dataset; our models demonstrated better performance. We show that the major effector of such differences is the use of our novel features. To evaluate the effect of our prediction results on the quality of schedules produced by appointment systems (AS), we developed an interface layer between our prediction models and the AS, where prediction results comprise the AS input.

Additionally, we summarized the experience of thoracoscopic surgery in the treatment of CDH in infants.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of 109 children with CDH who underwent surgical treatment at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2011 to January 2021. According to the surgical method, the children were divided into an open group (62 cases) and a thoracoscopy group (47 cases).Patients who underwent surgical correction had the diaphragmatic defect size graded (A-D) using a standardized system. We compared the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative CCU admission time and other surgical indicators as well as the recurrence rate, mortality rate and complication rate of the two groups of children.  Results:   The index data on the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, postoperative hospital stay and postoperative CCU admission time were better in the thoracoscopy group than in the open group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). We compared the number of incision infections, lung infections, atelectasis, pleural effusion, and chylothorax between the two groups. There were more children in the open group than in the thoracoscopy group. The overall incidence of postoperative complications in the open group (51.61%) was higher than that in the thoracoscopy group (44.68%).The recurrence rate of the thoracoscopy group (8.51%) was higher than that of the open group (3.23%). In the open group, 7 patients died of respiratory distress after surgery, and no patients died in the thoracoscopy group.  Conclusions:   Thoracoscopic surgery and open surgery can effectively treat CDH. Compared with conventional open surgery, thoracoscopy has the advantages of shorter operation time, less trauma, faster recovery and fewer complications.

The aim of this study was to determine whether hypoxia in prostate tumors could be identified using a radiomics model extracted from T2-weighted MR images.  Materials and methods:   Eighty eight intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer patients were evaluated. Prior to radical prostatectomy, all patients received pimonidazole (PIMO). PIMO hypoxic scores were assigned in whole-mount sections from prostatectomy specimens by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to MRI. The region of interest used for radiomics analysis included the prostatic index tumor. Radiomics extraction yielded 165 features using a special evaluation version of RadiomiX [RadiomiX Research Toolbox version 20180831 (OncoRadiomics SA, Liège, Belgium)] for non-clinical use. Multivariable logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization was utilised using 10 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation to select the best model hyperparameters, optimizing for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   The average (out of sample) performance based on the repeated cross validation using the ONESE model yielded an AUC of 0.60±0.2. Shape-based features were the most prominent in the model.  Conclusion:   The development of a radiomics hypoxia model using T2 weighted MR images, standard in the staging of prostate cancer, is possible.""","""['Michelle Leech', 'Ralph T H Leijenaar', 'Tord Hompland', 'John Gaffney', 'Heidi Lyng', 'Laure Marignol']""","""["" Applied Radiation Therapy Trinity, Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, Discipline of Radiation Therapy, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland; leechm@tcd.ie."", ' Independent scholar, Amstenrade, the Netherlands.', ' Radiumhospitalet, Oslo University Hosptial, Oslo, Norway.', "" St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, Dublin, Ireland."", "" Applied Radiation Therapy Trinity, Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, Discipline of Radiation Therapy, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.""]""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Anticancer Res""","""['MRI-Based Radiomics Signature for the Preoperative Prediction of Extracapsular Extension of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics Features Measured with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness.', 'Radiomics Based on MRI as a Biomarker to Guide Therapy by Predicting Upgrading of Prostate Cancer From Biopsy to Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

We collected the cases of patients with MBC who survived >10 years post-metastasis diagnosis and assessed the patients' characteristics.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 245 consecutive patients diagnosed with MBC between January 2005 and December 2012 at our institution. Among them, 167 patients with confirmed survival of >10 years (i.e., long-term survival) or confirmed death at ≤10 years post-metastasis diagnosis were enrolled.  Results:   There were 22 patients with MBC who survived >10 years. Regarding the cancer subtypes, 11 patients (50%) with long-term survival were HER2-positive. Seven of the 11 patients with HER2-positive MBC have been without recurrence although anti-HER2 therapy was discontinued. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was most common in the patients who survived ≤5 years but was not present in the >10-year survival group. In the HER2-negative cases, more cases in the long-term survival group were treated with local therapy (34.4% in the <5-year survival group, 43.8% in the 5-10-year group, and 72.7% in the >10-year group).  Conclusion:   MBC patients who survive >10 years after being diagnosed with metastasis are more likely to be HER2-positive and treated with local therapy. This suggests the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy, and, conversely, clarifies unmet needs in TNBC and luminal-type MBC. The usefulness of local therapy was also supported by our findings.""","""['Mami Kikuchi', 'Takaaki Fujii', 'Chikako Honda', 'Keiko Tanabe', 'Yuko Nakazawa', 'Misato Ogino', 'Sayaka Obayashi', 'Ken Shirabe']""","""[' Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', ' Center for Medical Education, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', ' Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan; ftakaaki@gunma-u.ac.jp.', ' Department of General Surgical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Clinical predictors of long-term survival in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.', 'Clinical Outcomes, Treatment Patterns, and Health Resource Utilization Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation: A\xa0Real-World Retrospective Study.', 'Clinical features and prognosis of patients with first-episode liver metastasis of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.', 'Possible clinical cure of metastatic breast cancer: lessons from our 30-year experience with oligometastatic breast cancer patients and literature review.', 'Optimizing the management of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in the era of PARP inhibitors-proceedings from breast cancer expert group meeting.']"""

Patients and methods:   One hundred ninety-seven patients who underwent mastectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection (level II) after preoperative chemotherapy between June 2007 and June 2021 were included. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to confirm the relationships between different factors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were used to examine prognosis. Logistic regression was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   The median IBL was 55.0 g (range=5.0-420.0 g). IBL was <100 g in 143 patients (72.5%), 100-200 g in 39 patients (19.8%), and >200 g in 15 patients (7.6%).

Herein, we studied the impact of postoperative SML on GC prognosis.  Patients and methods:   A total of 370 patients with GC who underwent curative gastrectomy were retrospectively evaluated in this study. Postoperative SML was assessed on computed tomography (CT) images taken before surgery and 1 year after surgery. The impact of postoperative SML on survival was evaluated.  Results:   Postoperative severe SML was significantly associated with presence of comorbidities, higher tumor stage, higher postoperative complication rate and longer hospital stay. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for overall survival revealed that SML was an independent indicator of poor prognosis, along with age, tumor stage, preoperative sarcopenia, and operation time (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-4.20, p<0.0001). There was a strong association of severe postoperative SML with decreased overall survival in patients with preoperative sarcopenia.

Results:   Women giving vaginal delivery from rural areas were younger (30.9 vs. 31.3), had primary education (2.4% vs. 1.7%) and secondary education (16.2% vs. 10.1%), were in a relationship (86.1% vs. 81.6%) and more often had a higher BMI at birth (27.8 vs. 27.0), compared to the patients living in cities (p<0.05). In addition, between 07:00-18:59., induction of labour (20.7% vs. 19.1%), epidural anesthesia (35.4% vs. 34.0%) and episiotomy were performed more often (29.1% vs. 27.8%) (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Differences were shown in the course of vaginal delivery in relation to the place of residence of the women, and the time of day of the delivery. These factors should be considered in the planning of perinatal care. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct further research on the analyzed aspect in order to ensure the highest quality care.""","""['Grażyna Bączek', 'Monika Szyszka', 'Patryk Rzońca', 'Robert Gałązkowski', 'Urszula Tataj-Puzyna', 'Ewa Rzońca']""","""[' Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Didactics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', ' Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', ' Department of Emergency Medical Services, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', ' Department of Midwifery, Centre f Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Ann Agric Environ Med""","""['Midwife-led maternity care in Ireland - a retrospective cohort study.', 'Is Vaginal Birth without an Episiotomy a Rarity in the 21st Century?

This study is aimed at analyzing the risk factors affecting muscle mass decline in MHD patients.  Methods:   This retrospective study included MHD patients who underwent two body composition assessments in October 2013 and November 2017. Depending on whether there was muscle loss or not, the patients were divided into a normal muscle mass (NMM) group and a muscle mass decline (MMD) group. According to the muscle mass decline rate, patients in the MMD group were further classified into a low-rate group and a high-rate group. Biochemical variables, serum vitamin concentrations, anthropometric data, SGA, muscle mass, handgrip, and daily steps were assessed. Risk factors for muscle mass decline were screened by multivariate logistic analysis and linear regression analysis.  Results:   Of the 72 MHD patients included in this study, 33 were male and 39 were female with a mean age of 56.80 ± 10.86 years and a mean dialysis duration of 7.50 ± 5.20 years. Age (P = .014) and serum 25(OH)D (P = .040) were found to be associated with a higher risk of muscle mass decline after adjusting for gender, dialysis vintage, albumin, and hs-CRP (P = .040). Further analysis found that dialysis vintage (β = 0.285, P = .030), 25(OH)D (β = -0.351, P = .007), and log NT-proBNP (β = 0.312, P = .020) were risk factors associated with the muscle mass decline rate in MHD patients.

This study analyzed whether candidates who completed a training class could perform the BPAT more effectively. Retrospective analysis of 30 males and 2 females who attempted the BPAT was conducted. BPAT tasks were: dry and charged hose drag; halyard raise, roof walk, and attic crawl; roof ventilation and victim removal; ladder removal and carry; stair climb with hose bundle; crawling search and tower exit; stair climb with air bottles; hose hoist; and return to ground floor with air bottles. Independent samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05) and effect sizes calculated BPAT time differences between candidates who completed a training class or not. Twenty-nine candidates passed the BPAT; 6 completed a training class. The 3 candidates (2 males, 1 female) who failed did not complete a class. There were no significant between-group differences in BPAT times (p = 0.054-0.829). There were moderate effects for faster roof ventilation and victim removal, ladder removal and carry, and hose hoist times for candidates who attended a class (d = 0.74-0.95). While training classes may not be necessary for all candidates, physically demanding BPAT tasks were finished faster by candidates who completed a class.

Objective:   To study and characterize the structure of the affected categories (clean-up workers and victims) of the Chernobyl Catastrophe based on the materials of expert cases of the Central Interdepartmental Expert Commission (CMEC) in the remote post-accidental period (2013-2022).  Material and methods:   The work was performed in the design of a retrospective study that based on studying of 50,974 expert cases, which were considered by CIEC during 2013-2022 to establish a causal relationship between the disease and influence of radiation exposure and other harmful factors and conditions during ChNPP accident using a systematic analytical approach to assessing the medical and nonmedical parameters presented in medical expert documentation.  Results:   The total number of affected adult citizens as on 01.01.2022, compared to 2008, decreased by 477,953 persons, or by 26.05 % (from 1,834,536 to 1,354,746 persons). The number of clean-up workers of the accident decreased from 276,327 (2013) to 171,725 (2022), or by 104,602 people (37.85 %), that means - during the last 10 years, almost every third clean-up worker who participated in the liquidation of the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl NPP died. The number of adult victims decreased from 1,558,209 in 2008 to 1,183,021 in 2022, or by 24.08 % (375,188 persons). The average annual reduction in the absolute number of clean-up workers of ChNPP accident during 2013-2022 is about 7,770 people per year (9,424 during 2021), adult victims - 27,045 people per year (28,922 during 2021).

Unfortunately, the intraoperative balance between overcorrection and undercorrection remains challenging for the surgeon. The purpose of this study was to answer two questions: (1) Does the femoral head coverage measured on intraoperative fluoroscopy agree with that measured on postoperative radiography? (2) What is the reliability of intraoperative fluoroscopy in identifying hip center correction in PAO?  Methods:   A total of 173 patients (173 hips) who underwent PAO for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) at our center from July 01, 2020, to December 31, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging data from 111 patients (female/male, 98/13; right/left, 72/39; mean age, 28.93 years) were included in this study. The analysis included measurement of the lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), acetabular index (AI), anterior wall index (AWI), posterior wall index (PWI), extrusion index (EI), and medial offset distance (MO). These measurements were acquired from intraoperative fluoroscopic images and postoperative radiographs and compared by paired t test using SPSS (version 24.0). Significance was determined at a p value of < 0.05. Bland-Altman analysis, conducted using GraphPad Software (version 9), was used to quantify the agreement between intraoperative fluoroscopic images and postoperative radiographs.  Results:   The means (standard deviations, SDs) of the LCEA, AI, AWI, PWI, EI, and MO obtained on intraoperative fluoroscopy were 32.86° (5.73°), 0.66° (5.55), 0.29 (0.10), 0.75 (0.17), 11.15% (6.50%), and 8.49 mm (3.68 mm), respectively. On postoperative radiography, the corresponding values were 32.91° (6.31°), 1.63° (5.22°), 0.29 (0.15), 0.85 (0.14), 11.27% (7.36%), and 9.60 mm (3.79 mm). The differences in the LCEA, AWI, and EI acquired from intraoperative fluoroscopic images and postoperative radiographs were not significant (p = 0.90, 0.95, and 0.83, respectively), but those in the AI, PWI, and MO were significant (p < 0.05). The mean biases (95% limits of agreement) of the LCEA, AI, AWI, PWI, EI, and MO were - 0.04 (- 6.85), - 0.97 (- 7.78), 0 (- 0.30), - 0.11 (- 0.36), - 0.12 (- 11.92), and - 1.11 (- 5.51), respectively.  Conclusion:   The LCEA, EI, and AWI can be used to reliably predict postoperative femoral head coverage at the level of 2D graphics. Acetabular inclination can be cautiously assessed using AI on intraoperative fluoroscopy. In the absence of intraoperative 3D image evaluation, the AWI and PWI demonstrate acceptable agreement between fluoroscopy and radiography in assessing the acetabular version. Although the MO shows slight bias, it can be helpful in properly positioning the acetabulum during PAO.""","""['Jianping Peng#', 'Fei Xiao#', 'Junfeng Zhu', 'Chao Shen', 'Yang Li', 'Xiuguo Han', 'Yimin Cui', 'Xiaodong Chen']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Building 8, No. 1665, Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China.', ' Department of Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Building 8, No. 1665, Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China. chenxiaodong@xinhuamed.com.cn.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""BMC Musculoskelet Disord""","""['What Is the Reliability and Accuracy of Intraoperative Fluoroscopy in Evaluating Anterior, Lateral, and Posterior Coverage During Periacetabular Osteotomy?', 'Do Radiographic Parameters of Dysplasia Improve to Normal Ranges After Bernese Periacetabular Osteotomy?', ""Medialization of the Hip's Center with Periacetabular Osteotomy: Validation of Assessment with Plain Radiographs."", 'Periacetabular osteotomy in the treatment of severe acetabular dysplasia.

Methods:   Nineteen cases with BI without AAD treated by the correction of the clivus canal angle were retrospectively analyzed. Pre- and postoperative computed tomography scans and three-dimensional reconstruction views were obtained to measure the size of the CCA, pB-C2 distance, and degree of BI. Chiari malformation and syringomyelia were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical outcomes for all patients were measured using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scale. The CCA was corrected by using interfacet distraction and fixation techniques. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare pre- and postoperative measurements.  Results:   All the patients were followed up for 24.95 ± 5.22 months (range 12-36 months); no patient suffered intraoperative nerve or vascular injury. Clinical symptoms improved in 17 patients (89.5%). The mean JOA score increased from 12.32 ± 1.89 to 14.37 ± 1.30 (Z = -3.655, P < 0.001).

However, it is difficult for many patients to receive early immunotherapy since the early identification of the cause in AE is more complex. This study aimed to investigate the early predictors of initial immune-related seizures and to guide the evaluation of treatment and prognosis.  Methods:   One hundred and fifty-four patients with new-onset ""unknown etiology"" seizures with a course of disease less than 6 months were included. Serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific autoantibodies (NSAbs), including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- Methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor 1 (AMPAR1), AMPAR2, anti-leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 antibody (LGI1), anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR), anti-contact protein-related protein-2 (CASPR2) were used to screen for immune etiology of the seizures. In addition, patients with epilepsy and encephalopathy were also examined via brain MRI, long-term video EEG, antibody prevalence in epilepsy and encephalopathy (APE2) score, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). A logistic regression model was used to analyze the early predictors of immune etiology.  Results:   Thirty-four cases (22.1%) were positive for NSAbs. Among all 154 patients, 23 cases of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) (21 cases of NSAbs positive), 1 case of ganglionic glioma (NSAbs positive), 130 cases of epilepsy or seizures (12 cases of NSAbs positive) were recorded. Also, there were 17 patients (11.0%) with APE2 ≥ 4 points, and all of them met the clinical diagnosis of AE. The sensitivity and specificity of APE2 ≥ 4 points for predicting AE were 73.9% and 100%. The results of multivariate analysis showed that the NSAbs and APE2 scores independently influenced the early prediction of initial immune-related seizures (P < 0.05).

Methods:   An EJS-E was used in 17 elbow instability patients. The median follow-up was 26 months (range, 12-42 months). We evaluated the flexion-extension and pronation-supination movement arcs, visual analog scale (VAS) score, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey classification system, and occurrence of complications in these patients. Moreover, construct stiffness and maximum strength tests were performed to evaluate the strength of the fixation techniques.  Results:   The final median range of the extension-to-flexion and pronation-to-supination arc of the elbow was 135° (range, 110°-150°) and 165° (range, 125°-180°), respectively. The VAS pain scores were > 3 in two patients. The median MEPS was 90 (range, 80-100 points). Five patients showed signs of grade I post-traumatic osteoarthritis according to the Broberg and Morrey radiographic classification system, while grade II changes were observed in three patients. Complications included axis pin loosening with pin-tract infection in two patients, transient ulnar nerve symptoms in two patients, heterotopic ossification in two patients, and suture anchors infection in one patient. Based on the biomechanical testing results, the EJS-E exhibited higher stiffness and resisting force in varus loading. It was 0.5 (N/mm) stiffer and 1.8 (N·m) stronger than the internal joint stabilizer (IJS) by difference of medians (p < 0.05).

Methods:   Our retrospective study included 3761 day 5 single blastocyst FET cycles between January 2015 and December 2019. These FET cycles were divided into three groups according to the day 3 embryo cell number: 939 cycles in the < 8-cell group, 1224 cycles in the 8-cell group and 1598 cycles in the > 8-cell group. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were compared among the three groups.  Results:   The clinical pregnancy rate of day 5 single blastocyst transfer in FET cycles increased significantly as the day 3 embryo cell number increased (52.2%, 61.4% and 66.8%, P < 0.001). Similarly, the live birth rate increased significantly as the day 3 embryo cell number increased (42.7%, 49.8% and 54.9%, P < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to explore whether a decline in activities of daily living from hospital admission to discharge is associated with prognosis in LDLT patients, who once discharged from a hospital.  Methods:   We retrospectively examined the relationship between HAD and prognosis in 135 patients who underwent LDLT from June 2008 to June 2018, and discharged from hospital once. HAD was defined as a decline of over 5 points in the Barthel Index as an activity of daily living assessment. Additionally, LDLT patients were classified into four groups: low or high skeletal muscle index (SMI) and HAD or non-HAD. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between HAD and survival.  Results:   HAD was identified in 47 LDLT patients (34.8%). The HAD group had a significantly higher all-cause mortality than the non-HAD group (log-rank: p < 0.001), and in the HAD/low SMI group, all-cause mortality was highest between the groups (log-rank: p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, HAD was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 16.54; P < 0.001) and HAD/low SMI group (HR: 16.82; P = 0.002).

Results:   Of the 32 patients, only 24 (12 female) were analysed. Mean age was 13.6 ± 3.1 years old, mean HbAlc was 9.6 ± 1.9% and mean duration of illness was 5.4 ± 3.4 years. Majority (91.7%) were on multiple dose injections (MDI) while only 8.3% were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). All fasted in Ramadan without acute complications. Retrospective CGM analysis revealed similar results in time in range (TIR), time in hyperglycaemia and time in hypoglycaemia before and during Ramadan, indicating no increased hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic events related to fasting. Glycaemic variability before Ramadan as measured by the LBGI, HBGI and MAG, were similar to values during Ramadan.  Conclusion:   Ramadan fasting among T1DM children and adolescents, by itself, is not associated with short-term glycaemic deterioration. T1DM youths can fast safely in Ramadan with the provision of focused education and regular SMBG.""","""['Sze Teik Teoh', 'Suhaimi Hussain', 'Janet Yeow Hua Hong']""","""[' Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Putrajaya, Malaysia.', ' Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.']""","""2022""","""2022;37(""","""J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc""","""['Comparison of Insulin Pump Therapy and Multiple Daily Injections Insulin Regimen in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes During Ramadan Fasting.', 'Comparing the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with multiple daily insulin injection for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus evaluated by retrospective continuous glucose monitoring: A real-world data analysis.', 'Ramadan Fasting Among Older Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Real-World Study From the UAE.', 'Correlation between pre-ramadan glycemic control and subsequent glucose fluctuation during fasting in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes.', 'Integrated sensor-augmented pump therapy systems the MiniMed® Paradigm™ Veo system and the Vibe™ and G4® PLATINUM CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) system for managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

However, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether different concentrations of HSA are associated with patient prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between different concentrations of HSA and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods: The data for this retrospective study were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Patients with sepsis were divided into two groups according to the concentration of HSA received: 25% and 5% HSA. The primary outcome of this study was the 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we used multivariate Cox regression, propensity score matching, double-robust estimation, and inverse probability weighting models. Results: A total of 76,943 patients were screened, of whom 5,009 were enrolled. 1,258 and 3,751 patients received 25% and 5% HSA, respectively. The 28-day mortality rate was 38.2% (481/1,258) for patients in the 25% HSA group and 8.7% (325/3,751) for patients in the 5% HSA group. After propensity score matching, 1,648 patients were identified. The inverse probability weighting model suggested that 5% HSA received was associated with lower 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.73, p < 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: In patients with sepsis, 5% HSA received may be associated with a lower risk of 28-day mortality than 25% HSA.

This study aimed to evaluate the associations of postoperative changes in skeletal muscle mass volume with survival outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.  Methods:   Fifty-six patients who underwent major hepatectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma were studied. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the third lumbar vertebra was calculated from axial computed tomography images taken preoperatively and 3-6 months postoperatively (early postoperative period). The associations of clinicopathological variables, including changes of SMI after surgery, with overall survival and recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Moreover, the associations of decreased SMI and elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level with early recurrence and poor survival was compared.  Results:   Among 56 patients, 26 (46%) had sarcopenia preoperatively and SMI decreased in 29 (52%) in the early postoperative period. During the median follow-up of 57.9 months, 35 patients (63%) developed recurrence and 29 (50%) died. Decreased SMI in the early postoperative period was independently associated with a shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-6.18; P = 0.049) and a shorter recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.57; P = 0.039), whereas elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was not.

Here, we evaluate the role of genomics in diagnosis and management among consecutive individuals attending a specialised clinic and identify those with the highest likelihood of having a monogenic disease.  Methods:   A retrospective audit of 1697 consecutive, unrelated probands referred to a specialised, multidisciplinary clinic between 2002 and 2020 was performed. A concordant clinical and genetic diagnosis was considered solved. Cases were classified as likely monogenic based on a score comprising a positive family history, young age at onset, and severe phenotype, whereas low-scoring cases were considered to have a likely complex aetiology. The impact of a genetic diagnosis was evaluated.  Results:   A total of 888 probands fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and genetic testing identified likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) variants in 330 individuals (37%) and suspicious variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 73 (8%). Research-focused efforts identified 46 (5%) variants, missed by conventional genetic testing. Where a variant was identified, this changed or clarified the final diagnosis in a clinically useful way for 51 (13%). The yield of suspicious VUS across ancestry groups ranged from 15 to 20%, compared to only 10% among Europeans. Even when the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, those with the most monogenic disease features had the greatest diagnostic yield from genetic testing.  Conclusions:   Research-focused efforts can increase the diagnostic yield by up to 5%. Where a variant is identified, this will have clinical utility beyond family screening in 13%.

However, few reports have investigated the nutritional status of hospitalized patients with AOVF and the impact of malnutrition on their functional prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of hospitalized elderly patients with AOVF using the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score and to determine the usefulness of the CONUT score in predicting their functional prognosis.  Methods:   The CONUT score on admission was retrospectively calculated for 134 hospitalized elderly patients (mean age 83 ± 7.6 years, 66% female) with AOVF who received conservative treatment between 2017 and 2020. Functional outcome was assessed by comparing ambulatory ability before the onset of AOVF and upon discharge. Patients were divided into two groups: CONUT-high ( ≥ 4) and CONUT-low ( ≤ 3), according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to predict decline in ambulatory ability upon discharge. Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the relationships between the nutritional status and ambulatory ability. The discriminative power of the CONUT score was then compared with other nutritional assessment tools such as the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) by ROC analysis.  Results:   81% of hospitalized patients with an AOVF were malnourished at the time of admission. The CONUT-high group had a significantly higher rate of decline in ambulatory ability (P < 0.001) than the CONUT-low group. Logistic regression analysis revealed the CONUT score ( ≥ 4) as an independent risk factor for a decline in ambulatory ability (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.61-7.37, P = 0.0014). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the CONUT score (AUC = 0.724) was significantly greater than that for the GNRI (AUC = 0.624, P = 0.021) and PNI (AUC = 0.636, P = 0.0008).

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate factors that can predict discrepancies in the coronal alignment of the lower limb between radiographs taken in the standing and supine positions.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of patients who underwent full-length anteroposterior radiographs of the lower limb in both standing and supine positions between January 2019 and September 2021. The discrepancy in the coronal alignment of the lower limb between the standing and supine radiographs was defined as the absolute value of the difference in the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle between the two radiographs, which is presented as the ΔHKA angle. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to analyse the relationship among ΔHKA angle, demographic data, and several radiographic parameters.  Results:   In total, 147 limbs (94 patients) were included in this study. The mean ΔHKA angle was 1.3 ± 1.1° (range, 0-6.5°). The ΔHKA angle was significantly correlated with body mass index and several radiographic parameters, including the HKA angle, joint line convergence angle, and osteoarthritis grade. Subsequent multiple linear regression analysis was performed using the radiographic parameters measured on the supine radiographs with the two separate models from the two observers, which revealed that body mass index and advanced osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3 and 4) had a positive correlation with the ΔHKA angle.  Conclusions:   Body mass index and advanced osteoarthritis affected the discrepancy in the coronal alignment of the lower limb between standing and supine radiographs. A discrepancy in the coronal alignment of the lower limb could be more prominent in patients with an increased body mass index and advanced osteoarthritis, corresponding to Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3 and 4.""","""['Hyun-Soo Moon', 'Sung-Hwan Kim', 'Dae-Kyung Kwak', 'Seung-Hun Lee', 'Yung-Hong Lee', 'Je-Hyun Yoo']""","""[' Arthroscopy and Joint Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Arthroscopy and Joint Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. oships@hallym.ac.kr.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea. oships@hallym.ac.kr.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""BMC Musculoskelet Disord""","""['Assessment of lower limb alignment: supine fluoroscopy compared with a standing full-length radiograph.', 'Preoperative Supine Radiographs Are More Accurate Than Standing Radiographs for Preoperative Planning in Medial Open-Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy.', 'Pre-Surgery Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle and Weightbearing Line Percentage Are Nearly Perfectly Correlated to the Miniaci Angle When Planning Open Wedge High Tibial Osteotomies.', 'Is Lower-limb Alignment Associated with Hindfoot Deformity in the Coronal Plane?

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of RC on the prognosis and the optimal choice of adjuvant therapy for R0 reresection patients with T3 IGC.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with T3 IGC who underwent radical reresection from January 2013 to December 2018. RC was defined as histologically proven cancer at reresection. Demographics and tumour treatment-related variables were analysed in correlation with RC and survival. Adjuvant (Adj) chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).  Results:   Of the 167 patients with IGC who underwent surgery, 102 underwent radical extended resection. Thirty-two (31.4%) RCs were found. Hepatic side tumours (T3h) and both side tumours (T3h + T3p) were associated with the presence of RC. In multivariate analysis, RC and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS (P < 0.05). RC was associated with a significantly shorter median OS (20 vs. 53 months; P < 0.01) and DFS (11 vs. 40 months; P < 0.001) despite R0 resection. For R0 reresection patients with RC and/or lymph node metastasis, Adj CRT significantly improved OS (P = 0.024).

Capecitabine is an active drug with a favorable toxicity profile, showing strong anti-tumor activity against metastatic breast cancer. This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the TX regimen (docetaxel and capecitabine) and compared it with the TE (docetaxel and epirubicin) regimen in locally advanced or high risk early HER2-negative breast cancer.  Patients and methods:   This randomized clinical trial was conducted at five academic centers in China. Eligible female patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the TX (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice d1-14, q3w) or TE (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus epirubicin 75 mg/m2 d1, q3w) groups for four cycles. The primary endpoint was a pathological complete response in the breast (pCR). Secondary endpoints included pCR in the breast and axilla, invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.  Results:   Between September 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, 113 HER2-negative patients were randomly assigned to the study groups (TX: n = 54; TE: n = 59). In the primary endpoint analysis, 14 patients in the TX group achieved a pCR, and nine patients in the TE group achieved a pCR (25.9% vs. 15.3%), with a not significant difference of 10.6% (95% CI -6.0-27.3%; P = 0.241). In a subgroup with high Ki-67 score, TX increased the pCR rate by 24.2% (95% CI 2.2-46.1%; P = 0.029). At the end of the 69-month median follow-up period, both groups had equivalent iDFS and OS rates. TX was associated with a higher incidence of hand-foot syndrome and less alopecia, with a manageable toxicity profile.  Conclusion:   The anthracycline-free TX regimen yielded comparable pCR and long-term survival rates to the TE regimen. Thus, this anthracycline-free regimen could be considered in selected patients.

The respiratory exchange ratio (RER), defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2) to VO2, may be a useful noninvasive tool for detecting inadequate DO2. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that RER measured during liver transplantation may predict postoperative morbidity. Secondary objectives were to assess the ability of other variables used to assess the DO2/VO2 relationship, including arterial lactate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and veno-arterial difference in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (VAPCO2gap), to predict postoperative complications.  Methods:   This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients who underwent liver transplantation for end stage liver disease from June 27th, 2020, to September 5th, 2021. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. All patients were routinely equipped with a pulmonary artery catheter. The primary analysis was a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed to investigate the discriminative ability of the mean RER measured during surgery to predict postoperative complications. RER was calculated at five standardized time points during the surgery, at the same time as measurement of blood lactate levels and arterial and mixed venous blood gases, which were compared as a secondary analysis.  Results:   Of the 115 patients included, 57 developed at least one postoperative complication. The mean RER (median [25-75] percentiles) during surgery was significantly higher in patients with complications than in those without (1.04[0.96-1.12] vs 0.88[0.84-0.94]; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.80-0.93; p < 0.001) with a RER value (Youden index) of 0.92 giving a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 74% for predicting the occurrence of postoperative complications. The RER outperformed all other measured variables assessing the DO2/VO2 relationship (arterial lactate, SvO2, and VAPCO2gap) in predicting postoperative complications.  Conclusion:   During liver transplantation, the RER can reliably predict postoperative complications. Implementing this measure intraoperatively may provide a warning for physicians of impending complications and justify more aggressive optimization of oxygen delivery. Further studies are required to determine whether correcting the RER is feasible and could reduce the incidence of complications.""","""['Sean Coeckelenbergh', 'Olivier Desebbe', 'François Martin Carrier', 'Francois Thepault', 'Cécile De Oliveira', 'Florian Pellerin', 'Cyril Le Canne', 'Laurence Herboulier', 'Edita Laukaityte', 'Maya Moussa', 'Leila Toubal', 'Hiromi Kato', 'Hung Pham', 'Stephanie Roullet', 'Marc Lanteri Minet', 'Youssef Amara', 'Salima Naili', 'Oriana Ciacio', 'Daniel Cherqui', 'Jacques Duranteau', 'Jean-Louis Vincent', 'Philippe Van der Linden', 'Alexandre Joosten']""","""[' Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Paul Brousse Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ' Outcomes Research Consortium, Cleveland, OH, USA.', ' Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine Sauvegarde Clinic, Ramsay Santé, Lyon, France.', "" Department of Anesthesiology and Department of Medicine, Critical Care Division, Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada."", ' Department of Liver Hepatobiliary Surgery & Liver Transplantation, Paul Brousse Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ' Department of Intensive Care, Erasme University Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', ' Department of Anesthesiology, Grand Hôpital de Charleroi, Charleroi, Belgium.', ' Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Paul Brousse Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France. joosten-alexandre@hotmail.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""BMC Anesthesiol""","""['Assessing the discriminative ability of the respiratory exchange ratio to detect hyperlactatemia during intermediate-to-high risk abdominal surgery.', 'Predicting postoperative complications with the respiratory exchange ratio after high-risk noncardiac surgery: A prospective cohort study.', 'Anesthesia-relevant changes in metabolic parameters with different circulatory and liver functions.', 'Tissue oxygenation during liver transplantation.', 'Oxygen transport in adult respiratory distress syndrome and other acute circulatory problems: relationship of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption.']"""

Therefore, to identify a simple and effective clinical indicator to determine prognosis is essential for the management of sepsis patients. This study was mainly based on blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (B/A), a comprehensive index, to explore its correlation with the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization.  Methods:   Totally, adult patients in ICU who were diagnosed with sepsis in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database from 2008 to 2019 were involved in this study. The study population were divided into survivors group and non-survivors group based on the prognosis during hospitalization. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze the association between B/A level and the risk of ICU all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis and determine the optimal cut-off value of B/A. The study population was divided into low B/A group and high B/A group based on the optimal cut-off value. The survival curve of ICU cumulative survival rate was draw through Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between B/A and the prognosis of patients was conducted by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results.  Results:   A total of 10,578 patients with sepsis were enrolled, and the ICU all-cause mortality was 15.89%. The patients in the non-survivors group had higher B/A values and more comorbidities than those in the survivors group. RCS showed that the risk of ICU all-cause mortality increased with the B/A level, showing a non-linear trend (χ2 = 66.82, p < 0.001). The mortality rate in the high B/A group was significantly higher than that in the low B/A group (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that compared with the low B/A group, the ICU cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis was significantly lower in the high B/A group (log-rank test, χ2 = 148.620, p < 0.001). Further analysis of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that an elevated B/A (≥ 7.93) was an independent factor associated with ICU mortality among patients with sepsis.

Here, we aimed to develop a deep learning model that can identify, locate, and distinguish LNs in contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images with a higher accuracy.  Methods:   The preoperative CECT images and corresponding postoperative pathological diagnoses of 1466 patients with oral cancer from our hospital were retrospectively collected. In stage I, full-layer images (five common anatomical structures) were labeled; in stage II, negative and positive LNs were separately labeled. The stage I model was innovatively employed for stage II training to improve accuracy with the idea of transfer learning (TL). The Mask R-CNN instance segmentation framework was selected for model construction and training. The accuracy of the model was compared with that of human observers.  Results:   A total of 5412 images and 5601 images were labeled in stage I and II, respectively. The stage I model achieved an excellent segmentation effect in the test set (AP50-0.7249).

Materials and methods:   The charts of patients with refractory non-malignant LUTD who underwent continent or incontinent external urinary diversion at University of Cincinnati hospitals in the period between March 2012 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic and baseline characteristics, surgery indications, operative data, early and late outcomes were collected, analyzed, and compared.  Results:   A total of 78 patients including 55 patients with neurogenic bladder (NGB) and 23 patients with non-neurogenic bladder (non-NGB) refractory non-malignant LUTD were included. Fifty-three patients underwent incontinent urinary diversions (IUD), while 25 patients underwent continent urinary diversions (CUD). During the first 4 postoperative weeks, 53.85% (n=42) of patients developed complications, and the incidence was nonsignificantly higher in patients with NGB than those with non- NGB (56.36% vs 47.83%, p-value=0.490). Fever was exclusively encountered in patients with NGB earlier, while stomal retraction occurred only in patients with non-NGB later. More non- NGB patients had early wound infection. There was an overall improvement of urological symptoms in 52 patients (66.67%), and the rate was non-significantly higher in non-NGB patients than NGB patients (78.26% vs 61.82%, p-value=0.160). Late complications were reported in 47 patients and were more encountered in those with non-NGB than those with NGB (65.22% vs 58.18%). Stomal leakage and stenosis occurred more with CUD than with IUD (52% vs 0% and 28% vs 3.77%, respectively).  Conclusions:   External urinary diversion can achieve a reasonable level of urological symptoms control in patients with refractory non-malignant LUTD, but with associated adverse outcomes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nutritional status on the clinical outcome in lung transplant recipients.  Methods and study design:   A single-center retrospective study was conducted including 73 patients received lung transplantation from December 2015 to April 2022 in the Affiliated Henan Provincial People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Data were collected from the hospital information system. The records of BMI, malnutrition defined by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic criteria, hemoglobin and plasma albumin before operation were accessed. The primary outcome assessed was survival or mortality represented by Kaplan-Meier survival curves; the log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the influence of each factor on survival.  Results:   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that malnutrition, hemoglobin and plasma albumin were predictors of survival in lung transplantation (Log Rank p<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression showed that pre-operative hemoglobin <130 g/L (HR 2.532, p=0.036) and plasma albumin <35 g/L (HR 2.723, p=0.016) were associated with the decreased survival rate.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1 129 patients with malignant tumors hospitalized in the Cancer Center of Changzhi People's Hospital from June 2020 to February 2021. PA values of six parts of the body were measured by the body composition analyzer, including: left arm (LA), right arm (RA), left leg (LL), right leg (RL), the trunk (TR), and the whole body (WB). Patients' body mass index (BMI) was calculated and patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) was assessed. The differences of PA values of six parts were compared and their correlations with BMI and PG-SGA in combination with age, gender and tumor disease types were analyzed, binary classification regression on BMI and PG-SGA was performed, and the functions of the best prediction model was fitted. Decision tree, random forest, Akaike information criterion in a Stepwise Algorithm (stepAIC) and generalized likelihood ratio test were used to select appropriate variables, and the logit logistic regression model was used to fit the data. Results: Comparing the PA values of six parts in pairs, it was found that the PA values of LA and RA, LL and RL, and TR and WB were linearly correlated and the coefficient was close to 1 (P<0.001). Binary classification regression was performed for BMI and PG-SGA, respectively. In order to make the data have clinical significance, 18.5 kg/m(2) was used as the classification point for BMI, 4 and 9 were used as the classification points for PG-SGA score, and the models of A, B and C were obtained. Suitable variables including PA-LA, PA-TR and tumor disease types were used as variables to fit BMI classification; BMI, PA-LA and age were used as variables to fit the PG-SGA model with 9 as the classification point. PA-LA, PA-TR, BMI, age and tumor disease types were used as variables to fit the PG-SGA model with 4 as the classification point. In this study, the predicted values of models A, B and C obtained by R-studio were imported into SPSS 26.0 software, and the cut-off values of classification were obtained by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC analytic results showed that the best cut-off values of Model A, B and C were 0.155, 0.793 and 0.295. Model A recommended when the probability is >0.155, a patient's nutritiond tatus should be classified as BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) group. Model B recommended that PG-SGA<9 group be classified as the probability is >0.793. Model C recommended that PG-SGA < 4 group should be classified when probability is >0.295. Conclusions: The PG-SGA classification prediction model is simple to operate, and the nutritional status of patients can be roughly divided into three groups: normal or suspected malnutrition group (PG-SGA<4), moderate malnutrition group (4≤PG-SGA<9), and severe malnutrition group (PG-SGA≥9). This model can more efficiently predict the nutritional status of cancer patients, greatly simplify the nutritional assessment process, and better guide the standardized treatment of clinical malnutrition.""","""['X L Zhang', 'W Q Zhao', 'Y Y Du', 'Y Zhang', 'W L Li', 'W Q Hu', 'J Lu', 'J Zhao']""","""["" Department of Oncology, Changzhi People's Hospital, Changzhi 046000, China."", ' Postgraduate Department of Mathematics, University of York, UK YO105DD.', ' Graduate School of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China.', "" Gastrointestinal Surgery Department, Changzhi People's Hospital, Changzhi 046000, China."", ' Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi""","""['The clinical application value of phase angle of six parts in nutritional evaluation of tumor patients.', 'A simple assessment model based on phase angle for malnutrition and prognosis in hospitalized cancer patients.', 'Diagnostic test accuracy of nutritional tools used to identify undernutrition in patients with colorectal cancer: a systematic review.', 'Nutritional Risk and Assessment for Patients with Cancer Pain.', 'Comparative study on nutritional status of patients in intensive care unit with different assessment tools.']"""

Methods:   Univariate and multivariate logistical analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for early infections, which were combined and transformed into a nomogram model. The prediction model was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow test, concordance index (C-index), 1000 bootstrap replications, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curve.  Results:   One thousand eighty-four eligible patients got included and 7 preoperative variables were identified to be independently associated with early infections, including heart disease (odds ratio (OR): 2.17; P: 0.026), cerebrovascular disease (OR: 2.25; P: 0.019), liver disease (OR: 8.99; P: <0.001), time to surgery (OR: 1.10; P: 0.012), hematocrit (<lower limit; OR: 3.72; P: 0.015), the platelet-to-mean platelet volume ratio (PMR; >44.52; OR: 2.73; P: 0.047), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HCRP; >78.64mg/L; OR: 3.71; P: <0.001). For the nomogram model, AUC was 0.807 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.742-0.873), the Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated no overfitting (P = 0.522), and C-index was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.742-0.872) with corrected value of 0.784 after 1000 bootstrapping validations. Moreover, the calibration curve and DCA exhibited the tools' good prediction consistency and clinical practicability.

Psychological well-being (P-WB) is an important protective factor against mental illness. Preliminary research suggests that mindfulness- and yoga-based socio-emotional learning (SEL) interventions can each have a positive impact on preschoolers P-WB. The objective of this trial is to rigorously evaluate the effect of a 24-week combined mindfulness- and yoga- based SEL intervention in preschool children from a French socio-economically disadvantaged area.  Methods:   The P-WB promotion intervention is compared to a wait-list control condition in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Sixty-four pre-Kindergarten classrooms are randomized to the intervention or control group. Primary outcomes measure self-management capacity and core P-WB components: connection, insight, engagement, and positive relationship. Secondary outcomes include measures of mental health, executive functioning, and school performance. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed through teacher questionnaires, standardized observations of children in school context, and experimental tasks and by collecting results of the national evaluation at first grade. All children-level outcomes are evaluated at pre-intervention, at the end of the intervention, and 1 year later (follow-up analysis), to the exception of school performance which is evaluated at follow-up only. Intention-to-treat analyses, accounting for clustering within classes, will adopt a random effects linear regression model to examine outcomes for the intervention versus control children.  Discussion:   This is the first trial to rigorously evaluate a combined mindfulness- and yoga-based P-WB promotion intervention, and the first RCT evaluating a SEL curriculum in French schools. Results may have key implications for P-WB promotion in preschool children.  Trial registration:   https://www.drks.de/ DRKS00028623.

The difficulty in assessing the articular surface using radiography and the intra-articular element potentially involved make LHCF susceptible to complications and delayed diagnoses. Arthrography has been used to delineate the articular surface to aid in deciding whether closed or open reduction is necessary. However, there has been scarce evidence to determine the accuracy of using radiography versus arthrography to predict articular disruption in LHCF displaced 1-5 mm. This study assesses; (1) the utility of intraoperative arthrography in modifying the method of operative reduction, (2) the accuracy of plain radiography in identifying articular integrity, and (3) the clinical outcomes of early operative treatment.  Methods:   This was a single-center prospective study that involved operatively treated pediatric LHCF with a displacement of 1-5 mm. Patient demographics, radiographic displacement, predicted radiographic articular integrity, articular integrity on arthrograms, modification of management and follow-up clinical outcomes were obtained.  Results:   A total of 72 patients were included with a mean displacement of 2.6 mm and a mean follow-up of 16 months. The articular surface was disrupted in 21% of patients. The reduction method (open versus closed) was modified in 15 patients (21%) after an intraoperative arthrogram. Out of 25 patients with displacement < 2 mm, four of which (15%) had disrupted articular surface and were subsequently treated with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). While eleven patients with > 4 mm displacement had an intact articular hinge that were managed with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP). All patients achieved union with no documented major complications. The ability of radiography to discriminate between disrupted/ intact articular integrity decreases as displacement decreases.  Conclusions:   Data from this study suggest using the degree of displacement measured on plain radiography is insufficient in predicting articular integrity for fractures displaced 1-5 mm. The use of arthrography guides reduction method and adequacy, avoiding scenarios of unnecessary open reduction and insufficient closed reduction. Further, a significant amount of outliers exist that have intact articular hinges above 4 mm and disrupted hinges below 2 mm of displacement. Finally we report favorable outcomes using a lower threshold for early operative treatment.""","""['Ali Lari', 'Ahmad Alenezi', 'Jarrah Abughaith', 'Haitham AlShehawy', 'Wael Hammady', 'Saleh AlSaifi']""","""[' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, AlRazi Orthopedic Hospital, Kuwait City, Kuwait. dr.alilari@gmail.com.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, AlRazi Orthopedic Hospital, Kuwait City, Kuwait.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Orthop Surg Res""","""['Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning Versus Open Reduction and Internal Fixation for Type II Lateral Condyle Humerus Fractures in Children Displaced >2 mm.', 'Determining the stability of minimally displaced lateral humeral condyle fractures in children: ultrasound is better than arthrography.', 'The Utility of Intraoperative Arthrogram in the Management of Pediatric Lateral Condyle Fractures of the Humerus.', 'Current Concepts in the Treatment of Lateral Condyle Fractures in Children.', 'Current concepts in pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures.']"""

Methods:   A single-center prospective study of 16 r/r LBCL patients undergoing CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. Whole body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MR imaging pre-therapy and 3 weeks post-therapy were followed by manual segmentation of tumors and lymphoid tissues. Semi-quantitative and quantitative metrics were extracted, and the metric-wise rate of change (Δ) between post-therapy and pre-therapy calculated. Tumor metrics included maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV), Tumor Lesion Glycolysis (TLG), structural volume (V), total structural tumor burden (Vtotal) and mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADCmean). For lymphoid tissues, metrics extracted were SUVmean, mean Fat Fraction (FFmean) and ADCmean for bone marrow, and SUVmean, V and ADCmean for spleen. Univariate Cox regression analysis tested the relationship between extracted metrics and PFS and OS. Survival curves were produced using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test, with the median used for dichotomization. Uncorrected p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed, with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05 considered statistically significant.  Results:   Pre-therapy (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and Δ (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05) total tumor burden structural and metabolic metrics were associated with PFS and/or OS. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, a longer PFS was reached for patients with pre-therapy MTV ≤ 39.5 ml, ΔMTV≤1.35 and ΔTLG≤1.35. ΔSUVmax was associated with PFS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05), while ΔADCmean was associated with both PFS and OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). ΔADCmean > 0.92 gave longer PFS and OS in the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Pre-therapy bone marrow SUVmean was associated with PFS (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). For bone marrow FDG uptake, patient stratification was possible pre-therapy (SUVmean ≤ 1.8).

Alternatively, DNA from diagnostic archival tissue is available, but its somatic nature, limited quantity and suboptimal quality would require an accurate cost-effective genome-wide germline genotyping methodology.  Experimental design:   Blood and tissue DNA from 10 individuals were used to benchmark the accuracy of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) genotypes, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) or HLA haplotypes using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (lc-WGS) and genotype imputation. Tissue-derived PRS were further evaluated for 36 breast cancer patients (11.7 years median follow-up time) diagnosed with DCIS and used to model the risk of Breast Cancer Subsequent Events (BCSE).  Results:   Tissue-derived germline DNA profiling resulted in accurate genotypes at common SNPs (blood correlation r2 > 0.94) and across 22 disease-related polygenic risk scores (PRS, mean correlation r = 0.93). Imputed Class I and II HLA haplotypes were 96.7% and 82.5% concordant with clinical-grade blood HLA haplotypes, respectively. In DCIS patients, tissue-derived PRS was significantly associated with BCSE (HR = 2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8). The top and bottom decile patients had an estimated 28% and 5% chance of BCSE at 10 years, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in sagittal alignment and back pain in the thoracolumbar spine in nonsurgical DISH and control participants selected from a radiological database.  Methods:   Participants in the DISH and the control group were selected by searching for ""DISH or degenerative changes in the thoracic spine"" in the radiology database of Taizhou Hospital between 2018 and 2021 using Resnick and Niwayama's criteria. The subjects with spinal tumors, previous spinal surgery, vertebral fractures, inflammatory diseases, poor-quality radiographs, or loss of follow-up were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded retrospectively via the hospital information system and telephone follow-up. Segmental disc angles (SDAs), lumbar lordosis (LL), and bridge scores were analyzed using images of three-dimensional CT.  Results:   The final participants consisted of 51 individuals with DISH (DISH group) and 102 individuals without DISH (control group). Depending on the presence of thoracolumbar pain, the DISH group was divided into the DISH group with thoracolumbar pain (DISH+Pain) and the DISH group without thoracolumbar pain (DISH-Pain). The LL and SDAs of T11-T12 and T12-L1 were significantly greater in the DISH group than in the control group. In addition, the SDA of L1-L2 was significantly smaller in the DISH+Pain group than in the DISH-Pain group, whereas there was no significant difference in lumbar lordosis between the DISH+Pain group and the DISH-Pain group. The bridge scores in DISH+Pain group was larger in T10-T11 (p = 0.01) and L1-L2 (p < 0.01) spine segments than those in DISH-Pain group.  Conclusion:   The extension of DISH from thoracic to lumbar spine may increase lumbar lordosis and SDAs in the thoracolumbar spine. The DISH patients with more bony bridging and small L1-L2 SDA may be more likely have thoracolumbar pain.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is an effective treatment for patients with rheumatic disease hospitalized for PJP. This study aimed to describe the 90-day mortality of patients with rheumatic disease complicated by PJP and investigate whether the administration of TMP/SMX after 7 days from initial symptoms correlates with 90-day mortality.  Methods:   We enrolled consecutive patients with rheumatic disease complicated with PJP in our center from August 2018 to August 2021. The participants were classified into two groups according to when TMP/SMX was initiated: early (within the first 7 days) and late (after 7 days). The primary outcome was 90-day PJP-related mortality. Multivariate cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for mortality and examine differences in survival between early and late use of TMP/SMX.  Results:   Thirty-seven patients with rheumatic disease (median age 50.1 years, 24.3% male) complicated by PJP were enrolled in our study, and 15 (40.5%) patients died at or before 90 days of follow-up. The most common comorbidity was systemic lupus erythematosus (14, 37.8%), followed by inflammatory myopathy (11, 27.9%). Patients in the early group were less likely to require mechanical ventilation (8/27, 29.6% vs. 9/10, 90.0%, P = 0.002), lower doses glucocorticoids (43.2 mg/d vs. 72.2 mg/d, P = 0.039) and had lower mortality (7/27, 25.9% vs. 8/10, 80.0%, P = 0.006) than those in the late group.

Securing perforators around unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is essential for minimizing procedural risks in each treatment option. Therefore, we herein investigated whether the findings of high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (HR-CBCT) have an impact on decision-making for the treatment of MCA UIAs. Patients with MCA UIAs between October 2017 and September 2021 were consecutively recruited for this study. All patients underwent HR-CBCT and 3D-DSA before treatment. The imaging quality of both modalities to visualize the microvasculature around aneurysms was evaluated. Specific findings on the microvasculature surrounding aneurysms on HR-CBCT were investigated to facilitate microsurgical clipping. Fifty-two MCA UIAs were treated, including 43 by microsurgical clipping and 9 by endovascular approaches. The overall imaging quality of HR-CBCT was superior to that of 3D-DSA. Regarding microsurgical insights, sensitivity and specificity for the visualization of small vessels around aneurysms were 79 and 100%, respectively, using HR-CBCT, and 57 and 93%, respectively, using 3D-DSA.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple ligation-assisted endoscopic submucosal resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-MLUS) for R-NETs.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 62 patients with R-NETs ≤10 mm in size who underwent EMR-MLUS or ligation-assisted endoscopic submucosal resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-LUS) between May 2019 and April 2022, including tumor characteristics, endoscopic complete resection, pathological complete resection, the procedure time, adverse events, and follow-up were compared between the two groups of patients.  Results:   Of the 62 patients, 19 underwent EMR-MLUS and 43 underwent EMR-LUS. The endoscopic morphology of lesions was statistically different between group EMR-MLUS and group EMR-LUS ( P = 0.015), and most of them were flat and slightly raised lesions in group EMR-MLUS. Although the pathological complete resection rate was slightly higher in the EMR-MLUS group than in the EMR-LUS group (94.74% vs. 90.70%; P = 0.290), the endoscopic complete resection rate was high in both groups. Involvement of the lateral resection margin was found four cases in the ESMR-LUS group; one case of deep resection margin involvement in the EMR-MLUS group. The mean procedure time was longer in the EMR-MLUS group than in the EMR-LUS group (12.79 ± 1.01 min vs. 11.08 ± 1.89 min; P = 0.041). In group EMR-LUS, there were two cases of immediate bleeding; in group EMR-MLUS, one case of perforation, all of them were successfully treated by endoscopy. No recurrence, progression, or metastasis was found in all patients.

According to literature data, after implantation of a glaucoma drainage device into the anterior chamber, the speed of endothelial cells density (ECD) loss increases significantly.  Purpose:   To study the possibility of performing modified Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) with maximum graft diameter, and to assess its short-term effectiveness in the treatment of bullous keratopathy (BK) in the presence of a glaucoma drainage device in the anterior chamber.  Material and methods:   Modified surgery 3/4-DMEK was performed in 9 eyes of 7 patients with BK and Ahmed glaucoma drainage using graft of maximum diameter (11±1 mm). Average follow-up time was 15.3±2.5 months (12 to 18 months).  Results:   No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. Mean ECD after 12 months amounted to 1664±346 cells/mm2, which corresponds to ECD reduction of 34±9.6% (24 to 49%) in comparison to preoperative values. Mean best corrected visual acuity 12 months after surgery increased from 0.04±0.03 (0.01 to 0.1) to 0.3±0.2 (0.04 to 0.7). The last follow-up examination revealed all corneas to have preserved transparency and stable pachymetry measurements (from 488 to 548 µm).  Conclusion:   Performing 3/4-DMEK with a mega graft for treatment of BK after drainage surgery is technically possible.

Formation of ocular staphyloma affects the macula causing myopic maculopathy, which leads to significant and irreversible decrease in visual functions.  Purpose:   To study the occurrence frequency of various forms of myopic maculopathy in scleral staphylomas of different localization in patients with pathologic myopia.  Material and methods:   The study included 105 patients with high myopia (105 eyes, axial length ≥26 mm). The main group consisted of 50 patients with myopic scleral staphylomas (50 eyes). The comparison group - 55 patients (55 eyes) without scleral staphylomas.  Results:   In the main group, myopic maculopathy was detected in 82% of eyes, it was absent in 96% of eyes in the comparison group. In the main group there were: staphyloma of the posterior pole of the eye with involvement of the optic nerve head (ONH) - 44% of eyes; macular staphyloma - 28% of eyes; peripapillary staphyloma - 12% of eyes; staphyloma below the ONH - 16% of eyes. Atrophic, neovascular and traction maculopathy was revealed in 22 eyes with staphylomas of the posterior pole of the eye. Dome-shaped changes in the macula were revealed in 17 patients (19 eyes) of the main group (15 eyes with staphylomas of the posterior pole of the eye, 4 eyes with macular staphylomas). The highest average value of axial length (30.94±0.81 mm) was noted in eyes with macular staphylomas, and the lowest (28.58±1.62 mm) - with staphylomas near the ONH.  Conclusion:   The presence of myopic maculopathy is associated with the presence of staphylomas with the odds ratio of 120.7 (95%, confidence interval 24.7-589.3).

Aims:   This paper reports activities of the forensic medicine service in Sfax, Tunisia and describes the forensic management of mass disasters related to the sinking of illegal migrant boats as well as the main challenges.  Methods:   This is a retrospective, descriptive study that includes all cases of drowning deaths examined at the forensic department of Habib Bourguiba Hospital, Sfax, following the sinking of illegal migrant boats over a four-year period (October 2017 to September 2021).  Results:   During the study period, we received 539 corpses following the sinking of illegal migrant boats. The median number of deaths was 93 per year. There was a significant decrease in the number of victims in 2019 (13 victims), followed by a significant increase in 2020 (115) and 2021 (271). We noted two frequency peak periods in June and July, 31.4% and 20.8%, respectively. The victims were mostly male (67.5%) with a sex ratio of 2.08. Minors aged under 18 years were 5.8% and pregnant women were 2.4%. The majority (63.1%) of the victims were of sub-Saharan origin and there has been an increase in the number of victims from this region over the past two years. Samples were systematically collected for genetic investigation and 146 (27.1%) victims were identified.  Conclusion:   There have been significant advances in the identification of the victims of migrant boat sinking around the Tunisian coast, however, there are several challenges in providing information rapidly to the families of the victims to clarify the uncertainty about the fate of their missing loved ones.""","""['Wiem Ben Amar', 'Hela Siala', 'Hanen Dhouib', 'Narjes Karray', 'Fatma Daoud', 'Houcine Lebkem', 'Zouhir Hammami', 'Malek Zribi', 'Samir Maatoug']""","""[' Service de médecine légale, Hôpital Habib Bourguiba, Sfax (Tunisie).']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""East Mediterr Health J""","""['Migrant deaths and the Kater Radez I wreck: from recovery of the relict to marine taphonomic findings and identification of the victims.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Patterns of homicide in Sfax, Tunisia: A 9-year cohort study (2011-2019).', 'Physical violence against women in southern Tunisia: Epidemiology and risk factors.', 'Development of forensic thanatology through the prism of analysis of postmortem protocols collected at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Jagiellonian University.']"""

We compared the effectiveness of both approaches in developing patient-centred attitudes in students.  Methods:   We retrospectively compared students who participated in the clinical communication course (CCC), based on student role playing (CCCsp-, n = 160), to students who participated in the CCC with SPs (CCCsp+, n = 146), and students with no formal CCC (CCC-, n = 122). We used validated questionnaires to assess patient centredness. We also conducted focus group interviews (FGI) to better understand the impact of CCC with sp.  Results:   Students after the CCC with simulated patients achieved a significantly higher score in the patient-practitioner orientation scale than other groups (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   There is a strong positive correlation between the implementation of simulated patients and patient-centred attitudes among students.

The mean age of the Veterans increased from 47.8 (9.1) years to 58.0 (12.4) years during the study period. The population remained predominantly (>95%) male and majority Black (∼50%). The prevalence of the CVD outcomes increased progressively over the study period: coronary artery disease (3.9%-18.7%), peripheral artery disease (2.3%, 10.3%), ischemic cerebrovascular disease (1.1%-9.9%), and heart failure (2.4%-10.5%). There was a progressive increase in risk factor burden, except for smoking which declined after 2015. The AAPC in prevalence was statistically significant for the CVD outcomes and risk factors. When adjusted for age, the predicted prevalence of CVD risk factors and outcomes showed comparable (but attenuated) trends. There was generally a comparable (but attenuated) trend in incidence of CVD outcomes, procedures, and risk factors over the study period. The use of statins increased from 10.6% (2001) to 40.8% (2019). Antiretroviral therapy usage increased from 77.7% (2001) to 85.0% (2019).

Methods:   A total of 2059 TJA patients were enrolled. We used the ratios of RBC, Hb, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD to DVT before TJA to create the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, thereby calculating the cut-off values and the area under the curve (AUC).

Methods:   This retrospective study included 170 children with blunt hepatic trauma between May 1, 2015, and August 30, 2021, who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT. Both liver parenchyma and liver trauma regions were manually segmented from CT images. Two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained on 118 cases between May 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019, for liver segmentation and liver trauma segmentation. Liver volume and trauma volume were automatically calculated based on the segmentation results, and the liver parenchymal disruption index (LPDI) was computed as the ratio of liver trauma volume to liver volume. The segmentation performance was tested on 52 cases between January 1, 2020, and August 30, 2021. Correlation analysis among the LPDI, trauma volume, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) liver injury grade was performed using the Spearman rank correlation. The performance of severity assessment of pediatric blunt hepatic trauma based on the LPDI and trauma volume was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   The Dice, precision, and recall of the developed deep learning framework were 94.75, 94.11, and 95.46% in segmenting the liver and 72.91, 72.40, and 76.80% in segmenting the trauma regions.

Methods:   PA patients with DM (PA + DM patients) who received adrenalectomy were recruited into the study. The patients were classified into 3 groups based on their DM conditions after treatment, including ""remission"", ""improved"" and ""unchanged"" groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to uncover the preoperative factors affecting the outcome of DM after adrenalectomy.  Results:   A total of 54 PA + DM patients received adrenalectomy. After adrenalectomy, 16.7%, 33.3% and 50.0% of patients were classified into the ""remission"", ""improved"" and ""unchanged"" groups, respectively. The factors negatively associated with remission or improvement from DM after adrenalectomy were longer duration of hypertension (P = 0.029). Higher concentration of urinary magnesium (P = 0.031) and higher 24 h urinary potassium (P = 0.049) were factors negatively associated with the ""remission"" from DM after adrenalectomy.  Conclusions:   Adrenalectomy was beneficial for the remission and improvement from DM in the half of PA patients with DM.

However, it is still unclear whether postoperative chemotherapy has a survival benefit for ypT1-2N0 gastric cancer patients who have undergone preoperative chemotherapy followed curative gastrectomy.  Methods:   The data of patients who undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by gastrectomy and had pathological classification of ypT1-2N0 between March 2016 and December 2020 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Chi-square test was adopted to compare the difference between the patients with postoperative chemotherapy (pCHT) and without postoperative chemotherapy (no pCHT). Survival curves for overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare survival difference. Univariate and multivariate analyses for prognostic factors were based on the Cox regression.  Results:   A total of 134 patients met the inclusion criteria and 56 (41.8%) of them have undergone postoperative chemotherapy. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics between pCHT group and no pCHT group (all p > 0.05). Postoperative chemotherapy was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.815, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.403-1.650; p = 0.474). Subgroup analyses demonstrated survival was equivalent between pCHT and no CHT group in ypT1N0 patients (HR 0.832, CI 0.222-3.121; p = 0.786) and ypT2N0 patients (HR 1.284, CI 0.564-2.924; p = 0.551). Multivariable analysis identified that clinical T stage independently influenced prognosis (cT3 vs. cT2: HR 2.875, 95% CI 0.998-8.281, p = 0.050; cT4 vs. cT2: HR 7.382, 95% CI 2.569-21.211, p < 0.001).

On MRI, PML may sometimes appear similar to primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential of amide proton transfer (APT) imaging for differentiating PML from PCNSL and GBM.  Methods:   Patients with PML (n = 4; two men; mean age 52.3 ± 6.1 years), PCNSL (n = 7; four women; mean age 74.4 ± 5.8 years), or GBM (n = 11; 6 men; mean age 65.0 ± 15.2 years) who underwent APT-CEST MRI between January 2021 and September 2022 were retrospectively evaluated. Magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) values were measured on APT imaging using a region of interest within the lesion. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to determine diagnostic cutoffs for MTRasym.  Results:   The mean MTRasym values were 0.005 ± 0.005 in the PML group, 0.025 ± 0.005 in the PCNSL group, and 0.025 ± 0.009 in the GBM group. There were significant differences in MTRasym between PML and PCNSL (P = 0.023), and between PML and GBM (P = 0.015). For differentiating PML from PCNSL, an MTRasym threshold of 0.0165 gave diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100% (all). For differentiating PML from GBM, an MTRasym threshold of 0.015 gave diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%, 90.9%, 80.0%, and 100%, respectively.

However, commonly used inflammatory markers do not show good utility for indicating endoscopic disease activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), inflammatory markers, and complete blood count (CBC) related parameters in patients with UC as simple, non-invasive, and independent markers of endoscopic activity (EA).  Methods:   We retrospectively collected extensive data from the hospital medical records of 386 patients who presented with UC to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Urumqi, China) from 2018 to 2022 January. The Mayo endoscopic score (MES) was used to evaluate endoscopic disease activity. All included patients were defined as the MES-All group; those with extensive colitis (E3) were defined as the MES-E3 group. Demographics, laboratory parameters, endoscopic results, the extent of disease, and drug history were recorded and analyzed.  Results:   For patients in the MES-All or MES-E3 group, hs-CRP, CAR, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were significantly higher in EA UC patients than in those with mucosal healing. The mean platelet volume (MPV) and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio were significantly lower in active disease than in the patient's remission (p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that in the MES-All and MES-E3 groups, the cutoff values of hs-CRP activity under endoscopy were 5.32 mg/L (AUC 0.850, sensitivity 77.6%, specificity 81.9%) and 5.16 mg/L (AUC 0.902, sensitivity 86.9%, specificity 85.4%) respectively, and the cutoff values of CAR were 0.14 (AUC 0.853, sensitivity 76.8%, specificity 84.8%) and 0.18 (AUC 0.904, sensitivity 81.8%, specificity 89.6%) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP, CAR, NLR, and PLR identified UC EA, while decreased MPV reflected inflammatory activity in the UC mucosa.  Conclusion:   Especially in patients with extensive colitis, hs-CRP and CAR are closely related to EA and show a higher diagnostic value compared to the related CBC parameters. The aforementioned indicators are simple and non-invasive independent markers that reflect the EA in UC.""","""['Jiawei Cui', 'Xiujuan Li', 'Zhiqiang Zhang', 'Hongliang Gao', 'Jian Li']""","""[' The Second Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830011, Xinjiang, China.', ' Department of Pathophysiology, College of Basic Medical, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830011, China.', ' The Second Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830011, Xinjiang, China. drzhiqiang@163.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""BMC Gastroenterol""","""['Correlation of Fecal Markers with Magnifying Endoscopic Stratification in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Who Are in Clinical Remission.', 'Patient-Reported Outcome and Clinical Scores Are Equally Accurate in Predicting Mucosal Healing in Ulcerative Colitis: A Prospective Study.', 'Evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio as potential markers for ulcerative colitis: a retrospective study.', 'Fecal calprotectin predicts complete mucosal healing and better correlates with the ulcerative colitis\xa0endoscopic index of severity than with the Mayo endoscopic subscore in patients with ulcerative colitis.', 'Endoscopic scoring indices for evaluation of disease activity in ulcerative colitis.']"""

Nevertheless, acidosis may be aggravated; thus, monitoring is essential after starting CRRT. Herein, we addressed the longitudinal trajectory of acidosis on CRRT and its relationship with worse outcomes.  Methods:   The latent growth mixture model was applied to classify the trajectories of pH during the first 24 hours and those of C-reactive protein (CRP) after 24 hours on CRRT due to AKI (n = 1815). Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios of all-cause mortality after adjusting multiple variables or matching their propensity scores.  Results:   The patients could be classified into 5 clusters, including the normally maintained groups (1st cluster, pH = 7.4; and 2nd cluster, pH = 7.3), recovering group (3rd cluster with pH values from 7.2 to 7.3), aggravating group (4th cluster with pH values from 7.3 to 7.2), and ill-being group (5th cluster, pH < 7.2). The pH clusters had different trends of C-reactive protein (CRP) after 24 hours; the 1st and 2nd pH clusters had lower levels, but the 3rd to 5th pH clusters had an increasing trend of CRP. The 1st pH cluster had the best survival rates, and the 3rd to 5th pH clusters had the worst survival rates.

This study evaluates the functional outcome and postoperatively performed level of sports in patients undergoing proximal humeral replacement (PHR) following resection of a primary bone sarcoma and identifies potential beneficial and limiting factors.  Patients and methods:   Between 2007 and 2020, a total of 606 patients underwent resection of a primary bone sarcoma and reconstruction with a single-design modular implant. For 112 (18%) patients, the location of the tumour was the proximal humerus. Exclusion criteria were death (n = 65), patients living overseas (n = 8), and subsequent amputation (n = 1), leaving 38 patients for evaluation, of whom 32 were available for the study (13 women, median age 42 years). Clinical data regarding oncological and surgical treatment as well as subsequent complications were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records. Functional outcome was determined using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score (MSTS) and Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) as well as the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV). Return to sports was assessed using the Tegner Activity Score (TS) and the modified Weighted Activity Score (WAS).  Results:   At the last follow-up after a median of 30 months (IQR 22-58), median MSTS was 18 (IQR 12-24), median TESS was 80% (IQR 69-87), median SSV was 35% (IQR 10-58), median TS was 5 (IQR 4-6) and median WAS was 5 (IQR 0-10). Preservation of the axillary nerve, a reverse shoulder reconstruction and a WAS of > 10 prior to surgery were associated with better functional outcome and return to sports activity scores.  Conclusion:   Following PHR, good to excellent functional outcomes are possible, and patients regularly return to participate in sports activities-most commonly in low-impact types of sports, but some individuals are even able to participate in high-impact sports activities.

However, whether letrozole is also beneficial to normal responders is not known. To investigate the clinical value of letrozole cotreatment during ovarian stimulation in vitro fertilization for normal ovarian reserve patients who were treated with the GnRH antagonist protocol, we conducted a retrospective study that based data from 1 January to 31 December 2017 for all IVF-ICSI GnRH-antagonist protocols. A total of 252 women who aged <40 years, FSH <10 IU/L on day 3 and antral follicle counting (AFC) >6 were included in the analysis (96 in the letrozole group and 156 in the no-letrozole group). The cumulative live-birth rate was calculated as the first live birth achieved after all cycles having an embryo transfer (cycles using fresh embryos and frozen-thawed embryos) among both groups. The initial gonadotropin (Gn) dosage and total Gn dosage were significantly lower and the number of days of Gn treatment was significantly fewer in the letrozole group than the non-letrozole group (p < 0.05). There were also significant between-group differences in luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations; and the number of metaphase II oocytes on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the implantation rate between the two groups that the letrozole group higher than the non-letrozole group (39.79 vs. 27.96%, p = 0.006), but there was no significant difference in the cumulative live-birth rate. The combination of letrozole with a GnRH antagonist may have no effect on the clinical pregnancy rate or cumulative live-birth rate in patients with a normal ovarian reserve. However, letrozole may increase the rate of embryo implantation and may reduce the requirement for exogenous gonadotrophins and, consequently, the cost of an IVF treatment cycle. In addition, the decreased estradiol level in the ovarian simulation by letrozole supports letrozole can be a safe solution for fertility preservation in estrogen-related cancer patients.""","""['Shuyi Zhang', 'Fumei Gao', 'Min Fu', 'Huan Shen', 'Yanbin Wang', 'Hongjing Han']""","""["" Reproductive Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Front Med (Lausanne)""","""['The depot GnRH agonist protocol improves the live birth rate per fresh embryo transfer cycle, but not the cumulative live birth rate in normal responders: a randomized controlled trial and molecular mechanism study.', 'Conventional ovarian stimulation and single embryo transfer for IVF/ICSI.

In this study, we investigated the use of fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) as a novel inflammatory marker to track the development and progression of PC-AKI in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) after the implantation of drug-eluting stents (DESs).  Methods:   A total of 872 patients with NSTE-ACS were enrolled in this study. PC-AKI was identified when serum creatinine (SCr) levels increased >26.5 mol/L (0.3 mg/dL) or was 1.5 times the baseline level within 48-72 h of exposure to an iodinated contrast agent. The effects of different variables on PC-AKI were evaluated using univariate regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of PC-AKI. The predictive value of FAR was assessed by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.  Results:   In total, 114 (13.1%) patients developed PC-AKI. The patients with PC-AKI had lower albumin levels (40.5 ± 3.4 vs. 39.0 ± 3.5, P < 0.001), higher fibrinogen levels (3.7 ± 0.6 vs. 4.1 ± 0.5, P < 0.001), and higher FAR levels (9.2 ± 1.7 vs. 10.5 ± 1.7, P < 0.001) than those with non-PC-AKI. There were no significant differences in the preoperative SCr levels between the two groups. After adjusting for confounding factors, FAR was found to be an independent predictor of PC-AKI (OR = 1.478, 95% CI = 1.298-1.684, P < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that for PC-AKI prediction, the area under the curve for FAR was 0.702. The optimum cut-off value of FAR was 10.0, with a sensitivity of 64.9% and a specificity of 69.8%. Moreover, FAR had a higher predictive value for PC-AKI than the Mehran score (0.702 vs. 0.645).  Conclusion:   Our study showed that elevated preoperative FAR was closely associated with the development of PC-AKI in patients with NSTE-ACS after implantation of DESs. Therefore, it may be worth monitoring FAR as a guide for using preventive measures to avoid the development of PC-AKI.""","""['Yong Qiao', 'Mingkang Li', 'Linqing Li', 'Chengchun Tang']""","""[' Department of Cardiology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst""","""['Predictive Value of Fibrinogen-to-Albumin Ratio for Post-Contrast Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.', 'Predictive value of combining the level of fibrinogen and CHA2DS2-VASC Score for contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.', 'Elevated serum fibrinogen levels and risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.', 'Occurrence and prediction on post-contrast acute kidney injury following endovascular interventions.', 'Elevated Serum Uric Acid/Albumin Ratio as a Predictor of Post-Contrast Acute Kidney Injury After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.']"""

Taken the GO-FAR score ≤ 0 group as the reference group, the OR values of good neurological prognosis in the GO-FAR score 1-8 group were 0.54 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.17-1.53, P = 0.250], 9-20 group were 0.17 (95%CI was 0.02-0.67, P = 0.009) and ≥ 21 group were 0.25 (95%CI was 0.05-0.85, P = 0.025). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the GO-FAR score for predicting favorable neurological outcome in IHCA patients was 0.653 (95%CI was 0.529-0.777, P = 0.015) and there was no significant difference in Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.311). All these suggested that there was no significant difference between the predicted value and the actual value.  Conclusions:   GO-FAR score can be applied to predict neurological prognosis of IHCA patients in Chinese population. It can help clinicians to predict the prognosis of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and propose critical recommendations in treatment for these patients or their families.""","""['Yan Ren', 'Li Ye', 'Xia Huang', 'Xia Gao', 'Guoping Yin', 'Xiaofang Wu', 'Wenbin Huang', 'Linghong Cao', 'Ping Xu']""","""["" Department of Emergency, Zigong Fourth People's Hospital, Zigong 643000, Sichuan, China."", ' Institute of Medical Big Data, Zigong Medical Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Zigong 643000, Sichuan, China.', "" Department of Emergency, Fushun People's Hospital, Zigong 643200, Sichuan, China.

Methods:   All patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled, and they were divided into AKI group and non-AKI group according to whether AKI developed within 14 days after cardiac surgery. Their clinical characteristics were compared. Based on five-fold cross-validation, XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to establish the prediction model of AKI after cardiac surgery. And the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the models was compared. The output model of XGBoost was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP).  Results:   A total of 6 912 patients were included, of which 5 681 (82.2%) developed AKI within 14 days after the operation, and 1 231 (17.8%) did not. Compared with the non-AKI group, the main characteristics of AKI group included older age [years: 68.0 (59.0, 76.0) vs. 62.0 (52.0, 71.0)], higher incidence of emergency admission and complicated with obesity and diabetes (52.4% vs. 47.8%, 9.0% vs. 4.0%, 32.0% vs. 22.2%), lower respiratory rate [RR; bpm: times/min: 17.0 (14.0, 20.0) vs. 19.0 (15.0, 22.0)], lower heart rate [HR; bpm: 80.0 (67.0, 89.0) vs. 82.0 (71.5, 93.0)], higher blood pressure [mmHg (1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa): 80.0 (70.7, 90.0) vs. 78.0 (70.0, 88.0)], higher hemoglobin (Hb), blood glucose, blood K+ level and serum creatinine [SCr; Hb (g/L): 122.0 (109.0, 136.0) vs. 120.0 (106.0, 135.0), blood glucose (mmol/L): 7.3 (6.1, 8.9) vs. 6.8 (5.7, 8.5), blood K+ level (mmol/L): 4.2 (3.9, 4.7) vs. 4.2 (3.8, 4.6), SCr (μmol/L): 88.4 (70.7, 106.1) vs. 79.6 (70.7, 97.2)], lower albumin (ALB) and triacylglycerol [TG; ALB (g/L): 38.0 (35.0, 41.0) vs. 39.0 (37.0, 42.0), TG (mmol/L): 1.4 (1.0, 2.0) vs. 1.5 (1.0, 2.2)] as well as higher incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis (30.6% vs. 16.2%, 3.3% vs. 1.9%), with significant differences (all P < 0.05). In the output model of Logistic regression, important predictors were lactic acid [Lac; odds ratio (OR) = 1.062, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.030-1.100, P = 0.005], obesity (OR = 2.234, 95%CI was 1.900-2.640, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.858, 95%CI was 0.794-0.928, P = 0.049), diabetes (OR = 1.820, 95%CI was 1.680-1.980, P < 0.001) and emergency admission (OR = 1.278, 95%CI was 1.190-1.380, P < 0.001). Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis showed that the AUC of the Logistic regression model for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.62 (95%CI was 0.61-0.67). After optimizing the XGBoost model parameters by grid search combined with five-fold cross-validation, the model was trained well with no overfitting or overfitting. ROC analysis showed that the AUC of XGBoost model for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.77 (95%CI was 0.75-0.80), which was significantly higher than that of Logistic regression model (P < 0.01). After SHAP treatment, in the output model of XGBoost, age and ALB were the most important predictors of the final outcome, where age was the risk factor (average |SHAP value| was 0.434), and ALB was the protective factor (average |SHAP value| was 0.221).  Conclusions:   Age is an important risk factor for AKI after cardiac surgery, and ALB is a protective factor. The performance of machine learning in predicting cardiac and vascular surgery-associated AKI is better than the traditional Logistic regression.

The weaned patients who were older than 18 years old and underwent mechanical ventilation for the first time due to cerebrovascular accidents, surgical operations, cardiovascular diseases, and pneumonia admitted to the department of critical care medicine of Zhejiang Hospital from January 2018 to June 2020 were enrolled. Among the patients, 40 cases received high-flow oxygen therapy after weaning, and 37 cases received Venturi combined with the humidifier. The patient's gender, age, primary disease, severity score, duration of mechanical ventilation before weaning, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after weaning, and pH value, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after weaning, the rate of performing mechanical ventilation after weaning, extubation time after weaning, and the rate of reintubation after extubation for 72 hours were collected.  Results:   There was no significant difference in baseline data such as gender, age, primary disease, severity score, and duration of mechanical ventilation before weaning between the two groups. After weaning, the vital signs of the two groups were stable, and there was no significant difference in HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or SpO2 at each time point between the two groups. After weaning, the pH of arterial blood gas analysis in the two groups and the fluctuations of PaO2 and PaCO2 in the high-flow group were not obvious. In the Venturi group, PaO2 gradually decreased after weaning, PaCO2 increased significantly at 12 hours, and slowly decreased after 12 hours. The PaO2 from 6 hours and PaCO2 from 12 hours in the high-flow group were significantly lower than those in the Venturi group, and continued to 24 hours [PaO2 (mmHg, 1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa): 112.34±38.25 vs. 156.76±68.44 at 6 hours, 110.92±38.66 vs. 150.64±59.07 at 12 hours, 111.12±36.77 vs. 141.30±39.05 at 18 hours, 110.82±39.37 vs. 139.65±41.50 at 24 hours; PaCO2 (mmHg): 41.30±7.51 vs. 47.42±7.54 at 12 hours, 40.97±6.98 vs. 45.83±8.63 at 18 hours, 40.10±7.06 vs. 46.14±9.15 at 24 hours, all P < 0.01]. The rate of performed mechanical ventilation after weaning and the rate of reintubation after extubation for 72 hours in the high-flow group were significantly lower than those in the Venturi group [17.5% (7/40) vs. 40.5% (15/37), 6.2% (2/32) vs. 31.8% (7/22), both P < 0.05], and the extubation time after weaning was significantly shorter than that in the Venturi group (hours: 22.43±11.72 vs. 28.07±10.42, P < 0.05).

We aimed to elucidate the predictive value of AISI, SIRI, and NLRP in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. A total of 1558 patients with ACS undergoing PCI were consecutively enrolled from January 2016 to December 2018. The AISI, SIRI, NLRP, systemic immune-inflammatory index, derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio cutoff values for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were calculated using receiver-operating characteristic curves, and Spearman's test was used to analyze correlations between these indices. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models were used for survival analyses, and the endpoint was a MACE, which included all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for severe heart failure during the follow-up period. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher AISI, SIRI, and NLRP values were associated with a higher risk of MACE (all P < .001). The association between AISI, SIRI, and NLRP and ACS prognosis was stable in various subgroups according to sex, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, and heart failure (P for interaction > .05).

Node-RADS is a recently proposed classification to categorize lymph nodes in radiological images. The present study sought to investigate the diagnostic abilities of CT texture analysis and Node-RADS to discriminate benign from malignant mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer.  Methods:   Ninety-one patients (n = 32 females, 35%) with a mean age of 64.8 ± 10.8 years were included in this retrospective study. Texture analysis was performed using the free available Mazda software. All lymph nodes were scored accordingly to the Node-RADS classification. All primary tumors and all investigated mediastinal lymph nodes were histopathologically confirmed during clinical workup.  Results:   In discrimination analysis, Node-RADS score showed statistically significant differences between N0 and N1-3 (p < 0.001). Multiple texture features were different between benign and malignant lymph nodes: S(1,0)AngScMom, S(1,0)SumEntrp, S(1,0)Entropy, S(0,1)SumAverg. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations between the texture features with Node-RADS score: S(4,0)Entropy (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), S(3,0) Entropy (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), S(2,2)Entropy (r = 0.72, p < 0.001).

A remarkable improvement in the outcomes has been witnessed due to evolution of highly effective targeted therapies replacing the traditional chemotherapy is most patients. However limited data is available regarding treatment outcomes of APL using various novel regimens from developing countries like Pakistan.  Methods:   This was a retrospective descriptive study which included APL patients treated at AFBMTC Rawalpindi from 2005 to 2020. It included a total of 51 eligible patients with a diagnosis of de novo APL confirmed by the presence of PML-RARA transcript or presence of t (15;17) by cytogenetics or FISH analysis. The protocols used for treatment included the UKAML MRC 12, the LPA-99/LPA-2005 PETHEMA, the APML4 and non-chemotherapy based ATO-ATRA protocol.  Results:   The study included 51 patients in which 31 (60.78%) were male and 20 (39.2%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 30 years (range 5-70). The commonest symptom was fever seen in 43 (84.3%) patients and bruising was the commonest physical finding present in 44 (86.3%) patients. High-risk patients were 23 (46.1%), 18 (35.3%) were intermediate risk and 10 (19.6%) were low risk. The LPA99/LPA2005 was most frequently employed protocol being used in 36 (72%) patients. There were 2 deaths during induction and 44 (86.3%) achieved CR post induction. The median follow up time was 32 months (range 1 to 190 months) with an overall survival (OS) of 76.5% and a relapse free survival (RFS) of 66.7.  Conclusions:   Our study shows APL is a highly curable malignancy and outcomes have improved with newer non chemotherapy based therapies. It can also be concluded that outcomes of APL gradually improved over the past 2 decades due to improvement in supportive care, provision of blood products and use of newer protocols.

The aim of this study is to analyse the overall survival and recurrence-free survival, after complete CRS and closed abdomen technique HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer.  Patients and methods:   This retrospective study collected the data from all patients who underwent a CRS with HIPEC for colorectal cancer at ""Cliniques universitaires Saint Luc"" from October 2007 to December 2020. Ninety-nine patients were included.  Results:   The median follow-up was 34 months. Post-operative mortality and Clavien-Dindo grade III/IV morbidity rates were 2.0% and 28.3%. The overall 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 80.1% and 54.4%. Using the multivariate analysis, age at surgery, liver metastases and PCI score >13 showed a statistically significant negative impact on overall survival. The 2-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 33.9% and 22%. Using the multivariate analysis, it was found that liver metastases, the extent of carcinomatosis with PCI>7 have a statistically significant negative impact on recurrence-free survival.  Conclusions:   Despite a high recurrence rate, CRS followed by HIPEC to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal origin offer encouraging oncologic results with a satisfying survival rate. When PCI>13, CRS and HIPEC does not seem to offer any survival benefit and to efficiently limit recurrence, our data are in favor of a maximum PCI of 7.""","""['M Livin', 'D Leonard', 'R Bachmann', 'C Remue', 'S Barbois', 'E Cotte', 'M Van Den Eynde', 'A De Cuyper', 'I Sinapi', 'A Van Maanen', 'A Kartheuser']""","""[' Colorectal Surgery Unit, Department of Abdominal Surgery and Transplantation, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', ' Department of General, Digestive, Oncological, Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, Hôpitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis, France.', ' Department of Digestive, Thoracic and Endocrine Surgery, Centre Hospitalier Universitaires Lyon-Sud, France.', ' Department of Medical Oncology, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', ' Department of Gastroenterology, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', ' Statistical Support Unit, Institut Roi Albert II Cancer Center, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""Acta Gastroenterol Belg""","""['Efficacy of 1 384 cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis underwent cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.', 'Novel prognostic score for outcomes after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for colorectal cancer with metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis.', 'Age alone is not a barrier to efficacy of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for colorectal peritoneal metastases: analysis of 1138 patients from the UK and Ireland Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases Registry.', 'Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for colorectal peritoneal metastases: analysis of short- and long-term outcomes.', 'Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for isolated colorectal peritoneal metastases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

As survival in ECPR patients is critically time-dependent, alternative models in ECPR delivery could improve equity of access.  Objectives:   To identify the best strategy of ECPR delivery to provide optimal patient access, to examine the time-sensitivity of ECPR on predicted survival and to model potential survival benefits from different delivery strategies of ECPR.  Methods:   We used transport accessibility frameworks supported by comprehensive travel time data, population density data and empirical cardiac arrest time points to quantify the patient catchment areas of the existing in-hospital ECPR service and two alternative ECPR strategies: rendezvous strategy and pre-hospital ECPR in Sydney, Australia. Published survival rates at different time points to ECMO flow were applied to predict the potential survival benefit.  Results:   With an in-hospital ECPR strategy for refractory OHCA, five hospitals in Sydney (Australia) had an effective catchment of 811,091 potential patients. This increases to 2,175,096 under a rendezvous strategy and 3,851,727 under the optimal pre-hospital strategy. Assuming earlier provision of ECMO flow, expected survival for eligible arrests will increase by nearly 6% with the rendezvous strategy and approximately 26% with pre-hospital ECPR when compared to the existing in-hospital strategy.  Conclusion:   In-hospital ECPR provides the least equitable access to ECPR. Rendezvous and pre-hospital ECPR models substantially increased the catchment of eligible OHCA patients.

Many current research efforts center on diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for IPF while other risk factors affecting disease pathogenesis receive less attention. Emerging data support the clinical importance of weight loss in patients with IPF. However, factors associated with weight loss and the impact of weight loss on mortality remain incompletely explored.  Objectives:   Explore the association between weight loss and transplant-free survival in patients with IPF and identify clinical variables associated with weight loss in this population.  Methods:   Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were generated and stratified by weight loss or use of antifibrotic medications. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate for factors associated with weight loss.  Results:   There was a significant increase in mortality in patients who lost ≥ 5% of their body weight loss (HR 2.21, [1.29, 4.43] p = .021). The use of supplemental oxygen (adjusted OR 13.16), and ≥ 200 mL loss of FVC over 1 year (adjusted OR 5.44) were both associated with a ≥ 5% weight loss in the year following a diagnosis of IPF. The use of antifibrotic medication did not significantly change median transplant-free survival in patients who lost more than ≥ 5% of their body mass.  Conclusions:   Weight loss over the first year following a diagnosis of IPF is strongly associated with decreased transplant-free survival.

Our purpose was to present a possible Munchausen syndrome by proxy with undernutrition and scurvy, presenting as ARFID in a child.  Methods:   We describe here a case of an 8-year-old boy who presented with severe undernutrition (BMI = 11.4) and scurvy leading to joint pains. The boy had had a very selective diet since early childhood, and his condition required hospitalization and enteral refeeding. Because of his specific eating behaviour, an ARFID was initially suspected. However, observation of the mother-child relationship, analysis of the child's eating behaviour, and retrospective analysis of his personal history suggested that this was not a true ARFID, and that the selective eating behaviour had probably been induced by the mother over many years, who probably maintained a low variety diet.

The patients were divided into two groups as Group 1 (n = 80, ESWL) and Group 2 (n = 75, URS) according to the type of procedure performed. The patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of age, gender, lateralization, stone size, stone volüme, stone density, and preoperative hydronephrosis. In addition, both methods used were compared in terms of success rate, time, cost, hospitalization and complications.  Results:   The mean age were 7.4 ± 2.1 in Group-1 and 8.1 ± 1.8 in Group-2. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data of both groups were similar. The hospitalization time, procedure time, success rate and cost were significantly higher in Group-2. The complication rate was significantly higher in Group-2 (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between ESWL success and stone volume (ρ - 0.375, p = 0.001) and stone density (ρ - 0.283, p = 0.011).

However, the effect of PC visits on total patient care cost has been difficult to quantify.  Objective:   To assess the effect of PC visits on total patient care cost.  Methods:   This is a retrospective study of over 5 million patients assigned to a PC provider in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in each of the 4 fiscal years (FY 2016-2019). The main outcome of interest is total annual patient care cost. We assessed the effect of primary care visits on total patient care cost first by descriptive statistics, and then by multivariate regressions adjusting for severity of illness and other confounders. We conducted in-depth sensitivity analyses to validate the findings.  Results:   On average, each additional in-person PC visit was associated with a total cost reduction of $721 (per patient per year). The first PC visit was associated with the largest savings, $3976 on average, and a steady diminishing return was observed. Further, the higher the patient risk (severity of illness), the larger the cost reduction: Among the top 10% of high-risk patients, the first PC in-person visit was associated with a reduction of $16 406 (19%).  Conclusions:   These findings, substantiated by our exhaustive sensitivity analyses, suggest that expanding PC capacity can significantly reduce overall health care costs and improve patient care outcomes given the former is a strong proxy of the latter.""","""['Jian Gao', 'Eileen Moran', 'Rachel Grimm', 'Andrew Toporek', 'Christopher Ruser']""","""[' Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Productivity, Efficiency and Staffing (OPES), Office of Analytics and Performance Improvement.', ' Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, NY, USA.', ' VACT Healthcare System, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""J Prim Care Community Health""","""['Evidence Brief: The Quality of Care Provided by Advanced Practice Nurses Internet.', ""Primary Care's Effects on Costs in the US Veterans Health Administration, 2016-2019: an Observational Cohort Study."", 'Changing Patterns of Mental Health Care Use: The Role of Integrated Mental Health Services in Veteran Affairs Primary Care.', 'Evidence Brief: Comparative Effectiveness of Appointment Recall Reminder Procedures for Follow-up Appointments Internet.', 'Association between health literacy and medical care costs in an integrated healthcare system: a regional population based study.']"""

However, the risk factors for a positive repeat OFC remain unclear.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 243 preschool children who failed an initial OFC with half a heated HE and repeated the same OFC after 6-24 months. Logistic regression models were used to determine risk factors for a positive repeat OFC, including factors that were ascertainable immediately after the initial OFC and at the repeat OFC as variables.  Results:   The median age, egg white-, and ovomucoid-specific IgE (sIgE) were 3.5 years, 12.7, and 7.2 kUA /L, respectively. The median interval between OFCs was 12.4 months and repeat OFCs were positive in 132 (54%) patients. One multivariate analysis model indicated that risk factors for a positive repeat OFC included cumulative dose (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:0.58), anaphylaxis (aOR: 3.09), total serum IgE (aOR: 0.41), ovomucoid-sIgE (aOR: 3.21), and age (aOR: 1.68) at the initial OFC. Another model indicated that the risk factors were cumulative dose (aOR: 0.59) and anaphylaxis (aOR: 3.41) at initial OFC and total serum IgE (aOR: 0.36), ovomucoid-sIgE (aOR: 4.93), and age (aOR: 1.30) at repeat OFC.  Conclusion:   Low threshold dose and severe symptoms at initial OFC, and low total serum IgE, high ovomucoid-sIgE and higher age at initial and repeat OFCs are risk factors for the persistence of HE allergy and they may be useful when deciding the rechallenge interval for heated HE in preschool children.""","""['Makoto Nishino', 'Noriyuki Yanagida', 'Sakura Sato', 'Ken-Ichi Nagakura', 'Kyohei Takahashi', 'Kiyotake Ogura', 'Motohiro Ebisawa']""","""[' Clinical Research Center for Allergy and Rheumatology, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Sagamihara, Japan.', ' Course of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', ' Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Sagamihara, Japan.', ' Department of Pediatrics, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Pediatr Allergy Immunol""","""['Safety and feasibility of heated egg yolk challenge for children with egg allergies.', ""Evaluation of baked egg oral immunotherapy in French children with hen's egg allergy."", ""Natural history of immediate-type hen's egg allergy in Japanese children."", 'Molecular diagnosis of egg allergy: an update.', ""Hen's Egg Allergy.""]"""

Most people who survive the initial injury eventually die without appropriate treatment. This study analyzed and reported the treatment strategy of a single center for BTAI in the last 10 years and the early and middle clinical results.  Methods:   This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with BTAI at Xijing Hospital from 2013 to 2022. All inpatients with BTAI aged ≥ 18 years were included in this study. The clinical data, imaging findings, and follow-up results were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier curve and multivariate logistic regression were used to compare survivors and nonsurvivors.  Results:   A total of 72 patients (57% men) were diagnosed with BTAI, with a mean age of 54.2 ± 9.1 years. The injury severity score was 24.3 ± 18, with Grade I BTAI1 (1.4%), Grade II 17 (23.6%), Grade III 52 (72.2%), and Grade IV 2 (2.8%) aortic injuries. Traffic accidents were the main cause of BTAI in 32 patients (44.4%). Most patients had trauma, 37 had rib fractures (51.4%), Sixty patients (83.3%) underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) surgery, eight (11.1%) underwent conservative treatment, and only four (5.6%) underwent open surgery. The overall hospitalization mortality was 12.5%. In multivariate logistic regression, elevated creatinine levels (P = 0.041) and high Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score (P = 0.004) were the predictors of hospital mortality.

Three patients (4.2%) needed secondary surgery and two of them underwent endovascular repair.  Conclusion:   Although TEVAR surgery may be associated with intra- or postoperative dissection rupture or serious complications in the treatment of Grade III BTAI, the incidence rate was only 8.9%. Nevertheless, TEVAR surgery remains a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of Grade II or III BTAI, and surgical treatment should be considered first,.

When demographic and descriptive data are taken into consideration, the mean age was 32.6 ± 6.76 years in patients undergoing fertility-sparing surgery and 54.05 ± 10.8 years in patients undergoing complete surgery, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Of patients undergoing fertility-sparing surgery, 11 (16.7%) had stage Ia disease (most common), 5 (7.5%) had stage Ic disease, whereas no patient with stage Ib disease was detected. Of patients undergoing complete radical surgery, 32 (48.5%) had stage Ia disease (most common), 1 (1.5%) had stage Ib disease with bilateral ovarian involvement, and stage Ic was the second most common disease stage. Also, stage Ic3 was the most common disease stage (8 patients, 12.1%) among those with stage Ic disease. The rate of recurrence was 4.5% (3 patients) in patients undergoing fertility-sparing surgery, and recurrences occurred at 37 months, 69 months, and 76 months, respectively. A patient with stage Ic3 disease and endometrioid type tumor who developed recurrence at 37 months died at 130 months. Of patients undergoing complete surgery, ten patients (15.2%) developed recurrence, and there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of recurrence (p = 1.00). At the end of 15-year follow-up period, there was no significant difference between patients undergoing fertility-preserving surgery and those undergoing complete surgery in terms of mortality (p = 0.668).  Conclusion:   The observation of significant findings in terms of the rate of recurrence and disease-free survival following fertility-sparing surgery in patients with low-risk early stage ovarian cancer suggests that survival is positively affected in early stage ovarian cancer.""","""['Özer Birge', 'Mehmet Sait Bakır', 'Selen Doğan', 'Hasan Aykut Tuncer', 'Tayup Simsek']""","""[' Department of Gynecology and obstetrics, Nyala Sudan Turkey Training and Research Hospital, West Alezza District Southern, 63311, Nyala, Darfur, Sudan. ozbirge@gmail.com.', ' Department of Gynecology Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Ovarian Res""","""['Fertility sparing surgery in early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Fertility sparing surgery for early-stage clear cell carcinoma of the ovary; A systematic review and analysis of obstetric outcomes.', 'Fertility-sparing surgery for patients with stage IC2 or IC3 epithelial ovarian carcinoma: any evidence of safety?', 'Outcomes of laparoscopic fertility-sparing surgery in clinically early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Fertility-sparing treatment for early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer: Contemporary oncologic, reproductive and endocrinologic perspectives.']"""

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a procedure that places a stent-graft on the lesion of thoracic aorta through a minimally invasive approach.  Case presentation:   Here we report that a catheter-induced aortic valve injury associated with TEVAR can cause delayed AR, exemplified by the case of a patient who developed acute AR 42 months after TEVAR. For this, aortic valve replacement was performed and the patient was discharged without complications.

There is a need for further improvement in the accuracy of predictive markers of response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The aim of this study was to develop a radiomic classifier to enhance current approaches to predicting the response to NAC breast cancer.  Methods:   Data on patients treated for breast cancer with NAC prior to surgery who had a pre-NAC dynamic contrast enhanced breast MRI were included. Response to NAC was assessed using the Miller-Payne system on the excised tumor. Tumor segmentation was carried out manually under the supervision of a consultant breast radiologist. Features were selected using least absolute shrinkage selection operator regression. A support vector machine learning model was used to classify response to NAC.  Results:   74 patients were included. Patients were classified as having a poor response to NAC (reduction in cellularity < 90%, n = 44) and an excellent response (> 90% reduction in cellularity, n = 30). 4 radiomics features (discretized kurtosis, NGDLM contrast, GLZLM_SZE and GLZLM_ZP) were identified as pertinent predictors of response to NAC. A SVM model using these features stratified patients into poor and excellent response groups producing an AUC of 0.75.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected 37 cases diagnosed with low-lying CM during pregnancy in the Peking University First Hospital from January 2019 to December 2020. The location of CM was confirmed by 3D ultrasonography, and clinical data, including postnatal outcomes, were recorded. When the conus medullaris was below L3 (excluding L3), it was diagnosed as low-lying conus medullaris, regardless of gestational age. The short-term postnatal outcome included assessment of symptoms and signs of motor and sensory neuron dysfunction.  Results:   The average gestational weeks of low-lying diagnosis was between 23 and 24 weeks. Among 37 cases, nine (24.3%) were complicated with spine dysraphism (3 cases of open spina bifida, 6 cases of tethered cord syndrome). Apart from 7 cases of pregnancy termination, the remaining 30 live births had a good prognosis in the short term, though 5 out of 6 cases of tethered cord syndrome underwent surgical release. The mean location of cases of open spinal dysraphism (n = 3) and those of closed dysraphism/tethered cord syndrome (n = 6) was at Lumber vertebra 5 (L5) and between L5 and Sacral vertebra 1 (S1), respectively, which showed statistical significance compared with the postnatally normal group. When we set Lumber 4.25 as the cut-off value to predict the diagnosis of spine dysraphism (mainly involving open spinal dysraphism and closed spinal dysraphism/tethered cord syndrome), the sensitivity was 66.7. At the same time, the specificity was 96%, along with the area under the curve (AUC) at 0.877.  Conclusion:   The second trimester finding of low CM is associated with spinal defects, mainly open spinal dysraphism and closed spinal dysraphism/tethered cord syndrome.

We sought to explore the incidence of BRCA1/2 reversion mutations in different tumor types. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed molecular profiling results from primary and/or metastatic tumor samples submitted by multiple institutions. The samples underwent DNA and RNA sequencing at a CLIA/CAP-certified clinical lab. Reversion mutations were called only in patients whose available clinical records showed the use of PARP inhibitors or platinum agents prior to tumor profiling. Results: Reversion mutations were identified in 75 of 247,926 samples profiled across all tumor types. Among patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations, reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were seen in ovarian cancer (OC) (30/3424), breast cancer (BC) (27/1460), endometrial cancer (4/564), pancreatic cancer (2/340), cholangiocarcinoma (2/178), prostate cancer (5/461), cervical cancer (1/117), cancer of unknown primary (1/244), bladder cancer (1/300), malignant pleural mesothelioma (1/10), and a neuroendocrine tumor of the prostate. We identified 22 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2 in OC. In BC, we detected 6 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. We compared molecular profile results of 14 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) with reversion mutations against 87 control HGSOC with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations without reversion mutations. Tumors with reversion mutations trended to have had lower ER expression (25% vs. 64%, p = 0.024, q = 0.82) and higher KDM6A mutation rate (15% vs. 0, p = 0.016, q = 0.82). Conclusions: We present one of the largest datasets reporting reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes across various tumor types. These reversion mutations were rare; this may be because some patients may not have had repeat profiling post-treatment.

Material and methods: In this retrospective study, all eyes received a single IVI-B (6 mg/0.05 mL) for wAMD or PCV with treatment-resistant SRF or PED. Outcome measures included assessment in central retinal thickness (CRT), visual acuity, and evaluation for changes in the SRF or PED on OCT. Follow-up was prior to the first brolucizumab injection, then at 1 week and 5 weeks afterwards. Results: In total, 10 eyes of 10 patients (6 women [60%]) were enrolled. Five patients had wAMD and five patients had PCV. Average age of participants was 67.6 years. All patients received one IVI-B. All patients were not treatment-naïve to anti-VEGF agents. At the first week and fifth week following the first IVI-B, seven out of seven patients (100%) had resolved SRF. However, seven out of nine patients (78%) had no improvement of their PED at 5 weeks follow-up. Mean PED height and width before the first IVI-B was 339.77 µm and 2233.44 µm, respectively. Mean PED height and width at the fifthweek following the first IVI-B was 328.125 µm and 2129.5 µm, respectively. Overall mean visual acuity before the first IVI-B was 0.224; and 5 weeks following the first IVI-B was 0.38.

Diagnoses:   Retrospective study of a selected series of patients with symptomatic Bertolotti's syndrome submitted to surgical treatment.  Interventions:   This study included 16 patients, being 8 submitted to the new modified mini-open tubular microsurgical transverse processectomy, Among those patients, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used in 6 surgeries to locate the base of the enlarged transverse process (6/8); intraoperative neuromonitoring was used in 6 patients (6/8), 3D intraoperative advanced spinal image (O-arm) with neuronavigation was used to localize the base of the pseudojoint to be removed and to check the final bone resection for the last 5 cases (5/8).  Outcomes:   The average paramedian lower back pain before surgery on the visual analogue scale for pain in the 8 patients was 6.6 (range: 5-8) and reduced to 1.5 (range: 0-3) at the latest follow-up after surgery, while the average pain score of the radicular pain on the right or left side before the surgery was 1.3 (range: 0-6) and reduced to 0.6 (range: 0-7) after the surgery.

Current treatments for postoperative pain are insufficient, and postoperative pain is difficult to control effectively with a single analgesic. Therefore, we investigated the analgesic efficacy of butorphanol with sufentanil after heart valve surgery and its hemodynamic effects. The records of 221 patients admitted to the intensive care unit after cardiac valve replacement between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2021, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were allocated to 2 groups based on the postoperative pain treatment they received: treatment group (administered butorphanol combined with sufentanil), and control group (administered conventional sufentanil analgesia). After propensity score matching for sex, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, type of valve surgery, and operation duration, 76 patients were included in the study, and analgesic efficacy, hemodynamic changes, and adverse drug reactions were compared between the 2 groups. After propensity score matching, the baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the groups. The histogram and jitter plot of the propensity score distribution indicated good matching. No significant differences were observed in the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of stay in the intensive care unit, duration of total hospital stay, and hospitalization expenditure between the groups (P > .05). The treatment group had notably higher minimum systolic blood pressure (P = .024) and lower heart rate variability (P = .049) than those in the control group. Moreover, the treatment group exhibited better analgesic efficacy and had lower critical-care pain observation tool scores and consumption of sufentanil 24 hours after surgery than the control group (P < .05). The incidence of vomiting was notably lower in the treatment than in the control group (P = .028). Butorphanol combined with sufentanil can be used in patients after heart valve replacement.

The multivariate analysis results showed that the duration of drainage tube (odds ratio = 1.010, 95% confidence interval: 1.232-6.178, P = .014) and duration of surgery (odds ratio = 1.010, 95% confidence interval: 1.002-1.017, P = .013) were associated with postcraniotomy fever in these patients. After treatment with different antibiotic regimens, the changes of white blood cells, sugar, chlorine and protein in CSF in patients with intensive antibiotic regimens were -638.48 × 106/L, 0.25 mmol/L, -0.76 mmol/L and -0.16 g/L respectively, which did not show significant differences when compared with ordinary antibiotic regimens (P > .05). Most cases of fever at the early stage after craniotomy in patients with infratentorial surgeries were nonintracranial infectious. Intensive antibiotic regimens did not show obvious advantages in improving the body temperature and CSF examination results. It is not necessary to use intensive antibiotic regimens too early, such as carbapenems or linezolids.""","""['Yuan Yao', 'Xian Wang']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China.', ' Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Risk factors associated with postcraniotomy meningitis: A retrospective study.', 'Efficacy of Closed Continuous Lumbar Drainage on the Treatment of Postcraniotomy Meningitis: A Retrospective Analysis of 1062 Cases.', 'The use of dehydrated amniotic membrane allograft for augmentation of dural closure in craniotomies and endoscopic endonasal transphenoidal surgeries.', 'Cerebrospinal fluid leakage after cranial surgery in the pediatric population-a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Antiepileptic drugs as prophylaxis for postcraniotomy seizures.']"""

The objective of this study was to explore posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty (PFDD) with and without tonsillar resection in adult patients with CM-I and syringomyelia.  Methods:   A total of 116 adult patients suffering from both CM-I and syringomyelia who were scheduled to undergo surgical decompression at our institution between 2012 and 2020 were randomly divided into 2 groups: the PFDD group (n = 64) underwent PFDD without tonsillar resection, while the PFDD-T group (n = 52) underwent PFDD with tonsillar resection. The primary outcome was improvement or resolution of the syrinx. The secondary outcome was an improvement in clinical outcome based on Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS) scores. All participants were followed-up to 1-year postoperatively.  Results:   The proportions of patients who had >20% improvement in syrinx size were 60.9% and 78.8% in the PFDD and PFDD-T groups, respectively (P = .038). The improvement in clinical outcome based on CCOS scores was significantly different in the 2 groups (P = .004). The functionality sub-score was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .027), but there were no significant differences in the pain symptoms, non-pain symptoms, and complications sub-scores. The total CCOS scores were higher in the PFDD-T group than in the PFDD group (P = .037).

This study aimed to compare the results of 40 and 120 minutes ethanol sclerotherapies that were performed in a single session to treat incidentally found simple renal cysts. We retrospectively reviewed 63 renal cysts in 62 patients treated by single session percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy. Thirty-one patients with 32 cysts underwent a 40 minutes sclerotherapy (group A), and 31 patients with 31 cysts underwent a 120 minutes retention technique (group B). Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance, cystic fluid was completely aspirated, and 50% of the aspirated volume was replaced with 99.5% ethanol (a maximum of 100 mL). Imaging follow-up of the patients was performed 3 months after sclerotherapy. The technical success rates were 100% in both groups. Eighteen patients (29.0%) were symptomatic (flank pain or discomfort). Indications of the other patients were large cysts (>5 cm; 46%) and an increment in the diameter on serial studies (25.4%). A significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of age, cyst diameter, volume of aspirated fluid, volume of injected ethanol, and percentage of reduction in cyst diameter (P > .05) was not found. After treatment, flank pain or discomfort resolved in 17 of 18 (94.4%) symptomatic patients. One patient complained of persistent flank pain; however, no significant abnormality was detected on post-procedural computed tomography images. There were no other complications after therapy in the 2 groups.

However, the effects of surgery on the postoperative HRQoL in the different endometriosis subgroups have not been fully evaluated.  Methods:   We performed a comparative retrospective study between 2014 and 2018 at the Medical University of Vienna, including all patients with surgically confirmed endometriosis who had completed the standardized Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) questionnaire 1 day after surgery (the questions refer to the 4 weeks preoperatively) and 6-10 weeks postoperatively.  Results:   Compared to preoperative values, we found significant benefits, regarding postoperative conditions, in our study group (n = 115) in all five categories, ""pain"" (HR 0.78, p < 0.001); ""self-determination"" (HR 0.92, p < 0.001); ""emotional health"" (HR 0.83, p < 0.001);"" social environment"" (HR 0.67, p < 0.001); and ""self-image"" (HR 0.47, p < 0.001). Patients with only peritoneal endometriosis had the lowest preoperative clinical symptoms and there were no significant changes in any of the categories. In the subgroups deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) and DIE + ovarian endometrioma, surgical intervention results in a significantly greater improvement in all categories of EHP 30 compared to ovarian endometrioma without DIE or peritoneal endometriosis.

Therefore, a rapid and accurate tool is necessary for field triage. The shock index (SI) multiplied by the AVPU (Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive) score (SIAVPU) reflected the hemodynamic and neurological conditions through a combination of the SI and AVPU. This study aimed to investigate the prediction performance of SI multiplied by the AVPU and to compare the prediction performance of other prehospital trauma triage scores in a population with traumatic injury. Patients and Methods: This study included 6,156 patients with trauma injury from the Taipei Tzu Chi trauma database. We investigated the accuracy of four scoring systems in predicting mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospital stay (defined as a duration of hospitalization >14 days). In the subgroup analysis, we also analyzed the effects of age, injury mechanism and severity, underlying diseases, and traumatic brain injury. Results: The predictive accuracy of SIAVPU for mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stay was significantly higher than that of SI, modified SI, and SI multiplied by age in the traumatic injury population, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.738 for mortality, 0.641 for ICU admission, and 0.606 for prolonged hospital stay. In the subgroup analysis, the prediction accuracy of mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stay of SIAVPU was also better in patients with younger age, older age, major trauma (Injury Severity Score ≥16), motor vehicle collisions, fall injury, healthy, cardiovascular disease, mixed traumatic brain injury, and isolated traumatic brain injury. The best cutoff levels of SIAVPU score to predict mortality, ICU admission, and total length of stay ≥14 days in trauma injury patients were 0.90, 0.82, and 0.80, with accuracies of 88.56%, 79.84%, and 78.62%, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, SIAVPU is a rapid and accurate field triage score with better prediction accuracy for mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stay than SI, modified SI, and SI multiplied by age in patients with trauma. Patients with SIAVPU ≥0.9 should be considered for the highest-level trauma center available within the geographic constraints of regional trauma systems.""","""['Ya-Chih Yang', 'Po-Chen Lin', 'Chi-Yuan Liu', 'I-Shiang Tzeng', 'Shu-Jui Lee', 'Yueh-Tseng Hou', 'Yu-Long Chen', 'Da-Sen Chien', 'Giou-Teng Yiang', 'Meng-Yu Wu']""","""[' Department of Research, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, New Taipei, Taiwan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Shock""","""['Shock index, modified shock index, age shock index score, and reverse shock index multiplied by Glasgow Coma Scale predicting clinical outcomes in traumatic brain injury: Evidence from a 10-year analysis in a single center.', 'Keeping it simple: the value of mortality prediction after trauma with basic indices like the Reverse Shock Index multiplied by Glasgow Coma Scale.', 'Correlation Between the Revised Trauma Score and Injury Severity Score: Implications for Prehospital Trauma Triage.', 'Improved identification of severely injured pediatric trauma patients using reverse shock index multiplied by Glasgow Coma Scale.', 'The Reverse Shock Index Multiplied by Glasgow Coma Scale Score (rSIG) and Prediction of Mortality Outcome in Adult Trauma Patients: A Cross-Sectional Analysis Based on Registered Trauma Data.']"""

Phantom experiments were performed to assess image noise with and without AEC, and indicated that AEC decreased differences in noise between slices of different section sizes. Retrospective analysis was conducted on 980 pediatric brain CT scans where the tube current was determined using AEC. The water equivalent diameter (WED) was employed as an index of the head size, and mean WED for each image set (WEDmean) and WED for each slice (WEDslice) were used for analysis. For the image-set-based analysis, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) was compared to WEDmean. For the slice-based analysis, the tube current was compared to WEDslice using 20 of the 980 sets. Additionally, CTDIvol and WEDmean were compared between male and female patients matched for age, weight, or WEDmean. CTDIvol increased with increasing WEDmean, and an exponential curve was closely fitted to the relationship. Tube current changed similarly to the change in WEDslice for each image set, and an exponential curve was well-fitted to the plots of tube current against WEDslice when data from the 20 sets were pooled together. Although CTDIvol and WEDmean were slightly but significantly larger for male than female patients after matching for age or weight, a sex-dependent difference in CTDIvol was not found after matching for WEDmean. This study indicated successful dose modulation using AEC according to the head size for each patient and each slice location.

It remains unclear whether accurate identification of these markers is also reliable in raters with different levels of experience.  Methods:   Patients with acute spontaneous ICH admitted at four tertiary centers in Germany and Italy were retrospectively included from January 2017 to June 2020. In total, nine NCCT markers were rated by one radiology resident, one radiology fellow, and one neuroradiology fellow with different levels experience in ICH imaging. Interrater reliabilities of the resident and radiology fellow were evaluated by calculated Cohen's kappa (κ) statistics in reference to the neuroradiology fellow who was referred as the gold standard. Gold-standard ratings were evaluated by calculated interrater κ statistics. Global interrater reliabilities were evaluated by calculated Fleiss kappa statistics across all three readers. A comparison of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) was used to evaluate differences in the diagnostic accuracy for predicting acute hematoma expansion (HE) among the raters.  Results:   Substantial-to-almost-perfect interrater concordance was found for the resident with interrater Cohen's kappa from 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.81) to 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.98). The interrater Cohen's kappa for the radiology fellow was moderate to almost perfect and ranged from 0.58 (95% CI 0.52-0.65) to 94 (95% CI 92-0.97). The intrarater gold-standard Cohen's kappa was almost perfect and ranged from 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) to 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-0.90). The global interrater Fleiss kappa ranged from 0.62 (95%CI 0.57-0.66) to 0.93 (95%CI 0.89-0.97). The diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of acute hematoma expansion (HE) was different for the island sign and fluid sign, with p-values < 0.05.  Conclusion:   The NCCT markers had a substantial-to-almost-perfect interrater agreement among raters with different levels of experience.

Results:   The most common indication was the ineffectiveness of oral medication (41.1%), followed by the personal willingness of the patient (35.5%), and 20.6% of the patients were young women with clear tumor boundaries. The pseudocapsule was not observed in 63 cases (58.9%), incomplete pseudocapsule was observed in 26 cases (24.3%), and complete pseudocapsule in 18 cases (16.8%). A total of 97 patients (90.7%) obtained 1-year post-operation remission. According to the relative location of the adenoma and pituitary gland on the MRI scan, 46 patients were classified into a central type, 59 a lateral type, and 2 a supra-pituitary type.

After operation, 2 sides (6.7%) in the combined group and 3 sides (10.0%) in the control group presented joint adhesion and poor activities. No complication such as lower limb deep vein thrombosis, aseptic fractures, and infections around the prosthesis occurred in both groups. At last follow-up, the KSS clinical score, KSS function score, and Feller score showed no significant difference between the two groups ( P>0.05). According to the KSS score, 24 patients (80.0%) had no obvious preference for patellar denervation combined with patellar replacement, 3 patients (10.0%) preferred patellar replacement combined with patellar denervation, and 3 patients (10.0%) preferred no patellar replacement. Anterior knee pain occurred in 6 sides (20.0%) of both groups.  Conclusion:   There is no significant difference in the long-term effectiveness between patellar denervation combined with patellar replacement and patellar denervation alone conducted in patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary TKA.""","""['Junce Jia', 'Xisheng Weng']""","""[' Deparment of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100730, P.

Methods:   The clinical data of 48 patients with proximal humeral fractures admitted between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including 18 males and 30 females. The age ranged from 28 to 69 years (mean, 56.3 years). The causes of injury included falling in 39 cases and traffic accident in 9 cases. The time from injury to operation was 2-5 days (mean, 2.8 days). All of them were Neer type Ⅳ proximal humerus fractures, including 11 patients with dislocation. All patients underwent internal fixation with a PHILOS plate after anatomical reduction of the greater nodule, and the rotator cuff was sutured to the plate to reinforce fixation. The operation time was recorded, the wound healing, fracture healing, and complications were observed. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Constant-Murley shoulder score, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score were used to evaluate shoulder function before operation, at 3 months after operation, and at last follow-up.  Results:   The operation time ranged from 65 to 90 minutes (mean, 76.9 minutes). All incisions healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 9-16 months (mean, 12 months). Fracture reduction was good and all fractures healed, the healing time was 2-6 months (mean, 4.6 months). There was no complication such as subacromial impingement, fracture redisplacement, and screw removal during follow-up. One patient had humeral head necrosis, but the basic function of the shoulder joint was acceptable, the symptoms were mild, and no treatment was performed. At 3 months after operation, the upper limb function of the patients basically recovered. The VAS score, Constant-Murley score, UCLA score, and ASES score significantly improved at 3 months after operation and at last follow-up when compared with preoperative, and further improved at last follow-up than at 3 months after operation ( P<0.05).

Methods:   Data from 502 patients with breast cancer, including 346 oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, 88 HER2-positive, and 68 triple-negative cases, who had undergone surgery were reviewed. Relationships between the clinicopathological factors, SUVmax, TILs, NLR, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival of all patients and each subtype were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank test. A sub-analysis of patients divided into low and high TIL groups was also undertaken.  Results:   High SUVmax was significantly related to high TILs (p < 0.0001). In low TIL (TILs1) group, patients with high SUVmax (≥3.585) had a significantly shorter RFS than those with low SUVmax (<3.585; p < 0.0001). In high TIL (TILs2,3) group, patients with high SUVmax had a shorter RFS than those with low SUVmax without a significant difference (p = 0.35). Multivariate analysis of 502 patients showed high SUVmax, high T status, and nodal metastasis were independent negative predictors of RFS. In 317 TILs-low patients, high SUVmax, high T status, nodal metastasis, and ER-positivity were independent predictors of RFS. In 185 TILs-high patients, nodal metastasis was an independent predictor of RFS.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed MRI findings of 76 consecutive patients with histopathologically-confirmed uterine cervical adenocarcinoma undergoing preoperative MRI examination. An experienced pathologist classified the histological subtypes based on World Health Organization's 2020 classification and into human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated adenocarcinomas (HPVAs, n = 54) (usual type and variants) and HPV-independent adenocarcinomas (HPVIs, n = 22) (gastric type adenocarcinoma (GAS), clear cell type, and other types). Different MRI variables were compared quantitatively and qualitatively between HPVA and HPVI and between GAS and non-GAS tumor types.  Results:   The maximum tumor diameter was significantly greater in HPVIs than HPVAs (41.9 ± 18.6 vs 32.7 ± 15.6 mm; p < 0.05). Heterogeneous enhancement on fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images was more frequently seen in HPVIs than HPVAs (62 % vs 15 %; p < 0.01) and in GASs than non-GASs (78 % vs 16 %; p < 0.01). Also, infiltrative growth pattern (58 % vs 20 %; p < 0.05) and intratumoral cyst formation (83 % vs 47 %) (p < 0.05) were more frequent in GASs than non-GASs.

Methods:   Clinical data of 144 patients with pituitary macroadenomas in the same surgical group at the Department of Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology were retrospectively analyzed from January 2019 to June 2021. Based on the results of the endocrinological evaluation and MRI examinations before and after surgery, the fluctuation of pituitary function and the extent of resection were analyzed. Multiple Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors affecting postoperative tumor residual.  Results:   Among the 144 patients with pituitary macroadenomas, 72 (50.0%) were female and 72 (50.0%) were male, the median age was 50 years, 26 (18.1%) had invasiveness grade 0, 46 (31.9%) had grade I, 57 (39.6%) had grade II, and 15 (10.4%) had grade III according to Lu's classification method. Based on observation during surgery, 37 cases (25.7%) had no pseudocapsule, 54 cases (37.5%) had incomplete pseudocapsule, and 53 cases (36.8%) had intact pseudocapsule. In addition, 91 (63.2%) patients had total resection, 39 (27.1%) had subtotal resection, and 14 (9.7%) had partial resection.

We aimed to determine the role of PCT in decreasing the duration of empiric antibiotic therapy among cancer patients admitted with COVID-19.  Methods:   This retrospective study included cancer patients admitted to our institution for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 28, 2021, with a PCT test done within 72 hr after admission. Patients were divided into two groups: PCT <0.25 ng/ml and PCT ≥0.25 ng/ml. We assessed pertinent cultures, antibacterial use, and duration of empiric antibacterial therapy.  Results:   The study included 530 patients (median age, 62 years [range, 13-91]). All the patients had ≥1 culture test within 7 days following admission. Patients with PCT <0.25 ng/ml were less likely to have a positive culture than were those with PCT ≥0.25 ng/ml (6% [20/358] vs. 17% [30/172]; p<0.0001). PCT <0.25 ng/ml had a high negative predictive value for bacteremia and 30 day mortality. Patients with PCT <0.25 ng/ml were less likely to receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics for >72 hr than were patients with PCT ≥0.25 ng/ml (45% [162/358] vs. 69% [119/172]; p<0.0001). Among patients with PCT <0.25 ng/ml and negative cultures, 30 day mortality was similar between those who received IV antibiotics for ≥72 hr and those who received IV antibiotics for shorter durations (2% [2/111] vs. 3% [5/176], p=0.71).  Conclusions:   Among cancer patients with COVID-19, PCT level <0.25 ng/ml is associated with lower likelihood of bacterial co-infection and greater likelihood of a shorter antibiotic course. In patients with PCT level <0.25 ng/ml and negative cultures, an antibiotic course of >72 hr may not be necessary.

Metabolomics including amino acid profiling enables detection of alterations in whole body metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether plasma amino acid profiles are modulated by SGLT2i use in HF patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Methods:   We retrospectively examined 81 HF patients with T2DM (68 ± 11 years old; 78% male). Plasma amino acid concentrations in a fasting state after stabilization of HF were determined using ultraperformance liquid chromatography. To minimize potential selection bias in the retrospective analyses, the differences in baseline characteristics between patients receiving an SGLT2i and patients not receiving an SGLT2i were controlled by using an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted analysis.  Results:   Of amino acids measurable in the present assay, plasma β﻿﻿-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), an exercise-induced myokine-like molecule also known as 3-aminoisobutyric acid or 3-amino-2-methyproponic acid, was detected in 77% of all patients and the proportion of patients in whom plasma BAIBA was detected was significantly higher in patients receiving an SGLT2i than in patients not receiving an SGLT2i (93% vs. 67%, p = 0.01). Analyses in patients in whom plasma BAIBA was detected showed that plasma BAIBA concentration was significantly higher in patients receiving an SGLT2i than in patients not receiving an SGLT2i (6.76 ± 4.72 vs. 4.56 ± 2.93 nmol/ml, p = 0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses that were adjusted for age and sex, SGLT2i use was independently associated with BAIBA detection. The independent association between BAIBA and SGLT2i use remained after inclusion of body mass index, HF with reduced ejection fraction, ischemic etiology, renal function, NT-proBNP, albumin, hemoglobin, and HbA1c into the Cox proportional hazards model. When the differences in baseline characteristics between patients receiving an SGLT2i and patients not receiving an SGLT2i were controlled by using an IPTW-adjusted analysis, least squares mean of plasma BAIBA concentration was significantly higher in patients receiving an SGLT2i than in patients not receiving an SGLT2i.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio have been proposed as non-invasive predictors of acute rejection in stable kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to validate the predictive value of these ratios, as well as neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet ratios in the diagnosis of acute rejection during the early post-transplant period. MATERIAL AND METHODS After propensity score matching, we compared 71 kidney recipients with biopsy-proven acute rejection with 71 patients without rejection and also subjects with different histologic types of rejection. All 3 types of blood cell count-derived ratios were calculated 6 and 3 days prior to biopsy and on the day of biopsy. RESULTS There were 15 patients with T cell-mediated rejection, 33 with vascular rejection, and 23 with antibody-mediated rejection. The values of all examined ratios did not differ between subgroups with and without rejection. However, at all post-transplant study time-points, patients with antibody-mediated rejection had significantly higher values of all analyzed ratios than subjects with other types of rejection. In multivariate regression models, higher values of blood cell count-derived ratios were independently associated with the occurrence of antibody-mediated rejection. CONCLUSIONS In the early post-transplant period, the values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, platelet-to-lymphocyte, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet ratios were similar in patients with and without an acute rejection episode, but significantly higher values were found in subjects with antibody-mediated rejection as compared with other types of rejection and those without rejection. High values of analyzed ratios in patients with satisfactory early kidney graft function may be helpful in selecting subjects with increased risk of subclinical antibody-mediated rejection.""","""['Aureliusz Kolonko', 'Tomasz Dwulit', 'Michał Skrzypek', 'Andrzej Więcek']""","""[' Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', ' Department of Biostatistics, School of Health Sciences in Bytom, Medical University of Silesia, Bytom, Poland.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Ann Transplant""","""['Value of Neutrophil-Lymphocyte and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratios in the Evaluation of Acute Rejection and Chronic Allograft Nephropathy in Children With Kidney Transplantation.', 'Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predict Acute Cellular Rejection in the Kidney Allograft.', 'Expression patterns of B cells in acute kidney transplant rejection.', 'Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for induction therapy in kidney transplant recipients.', 'Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for treating acute rejection episodes in kidney transplant recipients.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study included 106 patients with suspected NAFLD who underwent a hepatic parenchymal biopsy. MR-PDFF and MR spectroscopy were performed on all patients using a 3.0-T scanner. Following whole-volume segmentation of the MR-PDFF images, 833 radiomic features were analyzed using a commercial program. Radiologic features were analyzed, including median and mean values of the multiple regions of interest and variable clinical features. A random forest regressor was used to extract the important radiomic, radiologic, and clinical features. The model was trained using 20 repeated 10-fold cross-validations to classify the NAFLD steatosis grade. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was evaluated using a classifier to diagnose steatosis grades.  Results:   The levels of pathological hepatic steatosis were classified as low-grade steatosis (grade, 0-1; n = 82) and high-grade steatosis (grade, 2-3; n = 24). Fifteen important features were extracted from the radiomic analysis, with the three most important being wavelet-LLL neighboring gray tone difference matrix coarseness, original first-order mean, and 90th percentile. The MR spectroscopy mean value was extracted as a more important feature than the MR-PDFF mean or median in radiologic measures. Alanine aminotransferase has been identified as the most important clinical feature. The AUROC of the classifier using radiomics was comparable to that of radiologic measures (0.94 ± 0.09 and 0.96 ± 0.08, respectively).  Conclusion:   MR-PDFF-derived radiomics may provide a comparable alternative for grading hepatic steatosis in patients with suspected NAFLD.""","""['Ki Choon Sim', 'Min Ju Kim', 'Yongwon Cho', 'Hyun Jin Kim', 'Beom Jin Park', 'Deuk Jae Sung', 'Na Yeon Han', 'Yeo Eun Han', 'Tae Hyung Kim', 'Yoo Jin Lee']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. dr.minjukim@gmail.com.', ' AI Center, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' Department of Gastroenterology, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Korea.', ' Department of Pathology, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Korean Med Sci""","""['Diagnostic Feasibility of Magnetic Resonance Elastography Radiomics Analysis for the Assessment of Hepatic Fibrosis in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.', 'MR Spectroscopy-derived Proton Density Fat Fraction Is Superior to Controlled Attenuation Parameter for Detecting and Grading Hepatic Steatosis.', 'Agreement Between Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction Measurements and Pathologist-Assigned Steatosis Grades of Liver Biopsies From Adults With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.', 'Diagnostic value of MRI-PDFF for hepatic steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis.', 'Linearity, Bias, and Precision of Hepatic Proton Density Fat Fraction Measurements by Using MR Imaging: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods:   Patients with biopsy-proven axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis were included in this study. The lymph nodes were divided into three groups depending on the type of cortical thickening as diffuse, closer (eccentric cortical thickening on the side near the tumor and/or breast) and distant (thickening on the further side) asymmetry. Longitudinal to transverse axis (L/T) ratio, the largest cortical thickness, cortex to hilum ratio (C/H), hilar status (normal/displaced/absent), orientation (parallel/vertical), capsular integrity (sharp/indistinct), vascularisation pattern (hilar/peripheral/penetrant/anarchic/avascular) on superb microvascular imaging (SMI) and presence of conglomeration were recorded for each lymph node. Axillary nodal status on 18F-FDG PET-CT/MRI scans was recorded, if available. Features of the breast lesions like size, laterality, nuclear grade, hormone receptor status and the level of Ki-67 expression have been added.  Results:   A total of 219 metastatic ALNs [diffuse (n = 122), closer asymmetry (n = 71), distant asymmetry (n = 26)] were evaluated. By the univariate analysis, ALN metastasis was significantly associated with the presence of closer asymmetrical cortical thickening (p < 0,0001), C/H ratio (p = 0.001), cortical thickness (p = 0.001), hilar status (p < 0.005) and vascular pattern (p < 0.005). L/T ratio was only a statistically significant parameter for lymph nodes with diffuse cortical enlargement in predicting metastasis, and conglomeration was also observed only in this group (p < 0.05). By multivariate analysis, nodal metastasis was significantly associated with asymmetrical cortical thickening (p = 0.001), C/H ratio (p = 0.005) and vascular pattern (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Asymmetrical cortical enlargement on the side closer to the breast, C/H ratio and abnormal microvascular pattern are the independent predictors of axillary nodal involvement.

Limited data exist to guide this decision in obese patients. We sought to compare mortality after HKT and IHT in obese patients with non-dialysis-dependent kidney disease.  Methods:   The United Network for Organ Sharing was queried for data on adult heart transplant recipients from 2000 to 2022. Inclusion criteria were obesity, estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no pretransplant dialysis. HKT and IHT recipients were propensity matched. Morbidity was compared using chi-squared, Fisher's exact and McNemar's tests. Survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier estimation. Risk factors for mortality were examined with Cox regression.  Results:   A total of 289 HKT and 1920 IHT recipients met inclusion criteria. Heart-kidney recipients had higher baseline creatinine and rates of intensive care unit disposition than IHT recipients (both standardized mean differences >0.10). Propensity matching resulted in 239 pairs of HKT and IHT recipients with minimal differences in baseline characteristics. Heart-kidney recipients had higher 5- and 10-year survival than IHT recipients on unmatched (77% vs 69%, P = 0.011 and 58% vs 48%, P = 0.008) and propensity matched analyses (77% vs 68%, P = 0.026 and 57% vs 39%, P = 0.007).

The rigorous evaluation of tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary to demonstrate effectiveness before system-wide implementation. An NLP tool to use routinely collected data in the electronic health record was previously validated for diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective study for screening unhealthy substance use. Our next step is a noninferiority design incorporated into a research protocol for clinical implementation with prospective evaluation of clinical effectiveness in a large health system.  Objective:   This study aims to provide a study protocol to evaluate health outcomes and the costs and benefits of an AI-driven automated screener compared to manual human screening for unhealthy substance use.  Methods:   A pre-post design is proposed to evaluate 12 months of manual screening followed by 12 months of automated screening across surgical and medical wards at a single medical center. The preintervention period consists of usual care with manual screening by nurses and social workers and referrals to a multidisciplinary Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT). Facilitated by a NLP pipeline in the postintervention period, clinical notes from the first 24 hours of hospitalization will be processed and scored by a machine learning model, and the SUIT will be similarly alerted to patients who flagged positive for substance misuse. Flowsheets within the electronic health record have been updated to capture rates of interventions for the primary outcome (brief intervention/motivational interviewing, medication-assisted treatment, naloxone dispensing, and referral to outpatient care). Effectiveness in terms of patient outcomes will be determined by noninferior rates of interventions (primary outcome), as well as rates of readmission within 6 months, average time to consult, and discharge rates against medical advice (secondary outcomes) in the postintervention period by a SUIT compared to the preintervention period. A separate analysis will be performed to assess the costs and benefits to the health system by using automated screening. Changes from the pre- to postintervention period will be assessed in covariate-adjusted generalized linear mixed-effects models.  Results:   The study will begin in September 2022. Monthly data monitoring and Data Safety Monitoring Board reporting are scheduled every 6 months throughout the study period. We anticipate reporting final results by June 2025.  Conclusions:   The use of augmented intelligence for clinical decision support is growing with an increasing number of AI tools. We provide a research protocol for prospective evaluation of an automated NLP system for screening unhealthy substance use using a noninferiority design to demonstrate comprehensive screening that may be as effective as manual screening but less costly via automated solutions.

However, this superiority remains unknown when combined with PEGylated interferon α (PegIFNα). Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether NTs have more significant antiviral effects than NSs in combination therapy with PegIFNα.  Methods:   Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with PegIFNα plus nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) were retrospectively recruited. Efficacy and the predictors of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reduction >1 log10 IU/mL after 48 weeks were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 95 patients were included and divided into the PegIFNα + NTs group and the PegIFNα + NSs group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed. The PegIFNα + NTs group had a greater reduction of HBsAg (-3.52 vs. -2.33 log10 IU/mL, P=0.032) and a higher proportion of patients with HBsAg reduction >1 log10 IU/mL (100.0% vs. 72.2%, P=0.003) even after PSM. However, HBsAg and hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) loss rates, HBeAg seroconversion rates, degree of HBeAg and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA decline, HBV DNA undetectable rates, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization rates showed no significant differences.

Methods:   One hundred and eighty vertebrae of sixty patients with at least one (30) or without (30) a fragility fracture were retrospectively assessed. Patients had a DXA, an MRI and a CT scan from the three first lumbar vertebrae. Vertebrae texture analysis was performed in routine abdominal or lumbar CT and lumbar MRI using 1st and 2nd order texture parameters. Hounsfield Unit Bone density (HU BD) was also measured on CT-scan images.  Results:   Twelve texture parameters, Z-score and HU BD were significantly different between the two groups whereas T score and BMD were not. The inter observer reproducibility was good to excellent. Decision tree showed that age and HU BD were the most relevant factors to predict the fracture risk with a 93 % sensitivity and 56 % specificity. AUC was 0.91 in MRI and 0.92 in CT-scan using the Random Forest analysis. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 72 % and 93 % in MRI and 83 and 89 % in CT.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to compare texture indices computed from opportunistic CT and MR images. Age and HU-BD together with selected texture parameters could be used to assess risk fracture.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective dataset from a community oral cancer screening program was used to construct and train the novel voting meta-classifier. Comprehensive risk factor information from this dataset was used as input features for eleven supervised learning algorithms which served as base learners and provided predicted probabilities that are weighted and aggregated by the meta-classifier.

We investigated the influence of R-R interval reconstruction increments on left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) strain measurements of Computed tomography feature-tracking (CT-FT).  Methods:   Subjects who underwent retrospective electrocardiogram-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA) were retrospectively included, and CCTA images were reconstructed in 5% and 10% steps throughout the entire cardiac cycle (0-100% R-R interval). LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), circumferential strain (GCS), radial strain (GRS), LA GLS, ejection fraction (EF), and left atrioventricular coupling indices were computed. We evaluated the consistency and variability of continuous variables between the two reconstruction increment groups, the demarcation between the LA conduit and contraction phases, and observer reproducibility in 20 randomly selected participants.  Results:   Eighty-one participants with or without cardiac disease were included. The reconstruction increment of the R-R interval significantly affected the CT-FT-derived strain values. The 5% R-R increment resulted in significantly larger absolute strain values. LV GRS had the greatest difference between the two groups. In the subgroups with heart rates greater than 80 beats per minute or impaired cardiac function, group differences were attenuated, especially for LV GLS, LV GRS, and LA GLS. The prevalence of definite demarcation between the LA conduit and contraction phases was significantly higher in the 5% R-R reconstruction increment group than in the 10% R-R reconstruction increment group. The average heart rate during CCTA scanning was a strong risk factor for indefinite demarcation, which is independent of LVEF. As average heart rate increased, so did the incidence of indefinite demarcation between the LA conduit and contraction phases. The observer reproducibility of LV and LA strain values was independent of the R-R reconstruction increment.  Conclusion:   Reconstruction increment of the R-R interval is an important source of variation in LV and LA CT-FT strain values, especially with low heart rate and preserved cardiac function. It is essential to control the heart rate and apply a narrow R-R reconstruction increment to quantify phasic LA strain.""","""['Jiao Chen', 'Min Tang', 'Jin-Qiu Wang', 'Chao Chen', 'Ying Zhou', 'Guang-Ming Lu', 'Long-Jiang Zhang']""","""[' The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China; Department of Radiology, Mianyang Central Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Mianyang 621000, China.', ' Department of Radiology, Mianyang Central Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Mianyang 621000, China.', ' The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China; Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China.', ' The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China; Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China.

The coefficient of variation of glucose (GLUCV) is one of the methods used to evaluate GV. However, the clinical significance of GLUCV in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a risk factor for long-term adverse changes is unknown.  Material and methods:   In this retrospective study, we extracted data of adult DM patients diagnosed with CKD from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). We sought to investigate the relationship between GV and in-hospital mortality as well as 30-day mortality. A non-parametric test was used to compare baseline characteristics between groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model were used to analyse the risk factors associated with in-hospital and 30-day mortality.  Results:   A total of 1572 DM patients with CKD were included in our data analysis. The quartile of the GLUCV values was used to assign subjects to 4 groups: GLUCV1 (GLUCV < 24), GLUCV2 (24 ≤ GLUCV < 31), GLUCV3 (31 ≤ GLUCV < 39) and GLUCV 4 (GLUCV ≥ 39). COX regression analysis revealed that the GLUCV was an independent risk factor for in-hospital and 30-day mortality [GLUCV2 group (HR = 0.639, 95% CI: 0.454-0.899, p = 0.010), GLUCV3 group (HR = 0.668, 95% CI: 0.476-0.936, p = 0.019), and GLUCV3 group (HR = 0.726, 95% CI: 0.528-0.999, p = 0.049)]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was steeper in the GLUCV1 and GLUCV4 groups, and the survival rate decreased in a time-dependent manner.  Conclusions:   Herein, we validated GV as a mortality risk factor for DM patients with CKD.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the timing of laparoscopy on the spontaneous pregnancy rate of primary infertile patients complicated with pelvic effusion within 6 months after surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 330 primary infertile patients with pelvic effusion and bilateral patent fallopian tubes. They were divided into 3 groups based on retrospective analysis of clinical data. Study Group 1 underwent laparoscopy 1 month after hysterosalpingography (HSG), Study Group 2 received laparoscopy after trying to conceive for 3 months, and the Control Group did not undergo laparoscopy. According to the specific conditions during laparoscopy, repair and plastic surgery of fallopian tube, electrocautery of endometriosis and uterine suspension were performed. The main observation indicators were proportions of retrograde menstruation, peritoneal endometriosis, and tubal adhesions in laparoscopy groups, and spontaneous pregnancy rates within 6 months. RESULTS The proportions of retrograde menstruation were 92.2% and 93.1% in Study Group 1 and Study Group 2, respectively, with no statistical significance. The proportions of peritoneal endometriosis were 51.0% and 64.7%, with a statistically significant difference. The proportions of tubal adhesions were 31.4% and 36.2%, with no statistical significance. The pregnancy rates within 6 months were 73.9%, 52.6%, and 13.1%, with a statistically significant difference for pairwise comparisons.

The duration of TP serves as an indicator of patient outcome, although the exact duration of TP associated with poor patient outcome remains unclear. In this study, the data of 3,291 patients on their first admission to the ICU between January 2010 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Participants were divided into the no TP, TP 1-2 days, TP 3-6 days, and TP ≥7 days groups based on the duration of TP. External validation was performed using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III data set. Results: A longer duration of TP was significantly associated with high volume of transfusion and high hospital mortality ( P < 0.01), and 37.3% of the participants developed TP during their ICU stay. The results of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis after excluding the effects of patients who died shortly after ICU admission revealed the absence of significant differences between the no TP and TP 1-2 days groups ( P > 0.05). However, when the duration of TP exceeded 2 days, patient mortality increased with an increase in the duration of TP ( P < 0.01). Similar findings were obtained with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III data set. Conclusions: The duration of TP in critically ill patients is positively correlated with poor patient outcome. We classified TP as either transient TP or persistent TP based on a cutoff duration of 2 days.

We propose the distance between the gluteus maximus tendon gluteal sling (GS) and the center of the femoral head (FHC) as a novel anatomic landmark beyond the zone of injury, which can be used to restore limb length in the setting of proximal femoral bone loss or fracture.  Methods:   One hundred healthy hips were retrospectively reviewed using MRI to determine the distance between the proximal edge of the GS and the FHC. Additional measurements were collected including the distance between the GS and the greater trochanter and LT, as well as the FHC to the LT and greater trochanter.Results: The distance between the GS and the femoral head was consistent and measured 8.0 cm (±1.88 cm, SD = 0.66).

Subjects and methods:   Clinicopathological and 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and treatment regimens were retrospectively investigated in 20 lymphoma patients with NL, and analyzed their correlation with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   These 20 lymphoma patients (11 males, 9 females; median age, 49 years) included 10 primary and 10 secondary NL patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was noted in 19 patients, B-cell NHL was associated with 18 cases, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common. Notably, 18 patients were aggressive lymphoma while 2 were indolent lymphoma. The affected neural structures included nerve roots (n=17), peripheral nerves (n=3), cranial nerves (n=3), and neural plexus (n=2). Fluorine-18-FDG was avid in all cases, and the median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of neural and all lesions was 12.2 (range, 3.3-25.6) and 15.0 (range, 4.4-34.2), respectively.

Since virologically suppressed chronic HIV-infected subjects under effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) exhibit a persistent immune dysfunction that leads to comorbidities, iron homeostasis may be relevant in this context. We aimed to explore iron metabolism in virologically suppressed chronic HIV infected subjects under a successful ART.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, traditional iron metabolism biomarkers (total iron, ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin saturation index), as well as soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, and inflammatory markers were determined in virologically suppressed chronic HIV-infected subjects under at least 2 years of ART (HIV) who also had >350 CD4-T-cells/mm3 (N=92) from Spain. As controls, we collected non-HIV age-matched healthy donors (Young, N=25) and elderly subjects (>65 years old; Elderly; N=25). Additionally, an external group of non-HIV patients with ferritin<50 ng/mL diagnosed with absolute iron deficiency (Ferropenic group; N=84) was included. Comparisons between groups were performed using Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U-tests, while associations between variables were explored by Spearman's rho correlation coefficient.  Results:   We selected samples from HIV-infected subjects (aged 42[34-47], 95% males), young age-matched (aged 40[30-58], 60% males), and elderly controls (aged 82[78-88], 100% males). Compared to both healthy (Young and Elderly) groups, HIV exhibited decreased iron, transferrin saturation, and sTfR, and increased ferritin, but similar hepcidin levels. Notably, associations between sTfR and iron (Young, r=-0.587, p=0.002; Elderly, r=-0.496, p=0.012) or transferrin saturation index (Young, r=-0.581, p=0.002; Elderly, r=-0.489, p=0.013) were negative in both controls while positive in HIV (r=0.464, p<0.0001 and r=0.421, p<0.0001, respectively). Moreover, the expected negative correlation between hepcidin and sTfR, observed in controls (Young, r=-0.533, p=0.006; Elderly, r=-0.473, p=0.017), was absent in HIV (r=0.082; p=0.438). Interestingly, the HIV inflammatory profile differed from the Elderly one, who despite their inflammaging-related profile, succeed in maintaining these associations. Furthermore, subjects from the ferropenic group (aged 42[32-51], 5% males), showing significantly lower levels of hepcidin and higher sTfR, as expected, reflected similar correlations as those Young and Elderly, in contrast to HIV.

While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the archetype of PF-ILD, connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) can also manifest as PF-ILD. Few studies have described the value of serial computed tomography (CT) in predicting clinical progression of ILD. We explore which single and serial clinical and radiographic variables, in particular serial CT variables and a novel variable, the right lower lobe anterior bronchial angle (RLL-ABA), best predict mortality, oxygen requirement, hospital admissions, and lung transplant in CTD-ILD.  Methods:   This is a single-center retrospective study of 84 patients with a history of CTD-ILD. Cox survival analysis was used to predict two endpoints, all-cause mortality and composite negative outcomes (CNO): new oxygen requirement, respiratory admission, lung transplant, and death.  Results:   On serial CT, change in pulmonary artery (PA) size and RLL-ABA were predictive of mortality and CNO, and change in fibrosis was predictive of mortality alone. On single CT, the extent of fibrosis, PA size, and PA to aorta ratio were predictive of mortality and CNO. Among clinical variables, oxygen requirement, forced vital capacity (FVC), change in FVC, and worsening shortness of breath were predictive of mortality and CNO, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was predictive of mortality alone.

By univariable analysis, both the IMDC score and the two additional variables of the Meet-URO score were associated with either OS or PFS (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The four Meet-URO risk groups (G) had 1-year OS of 92%, 72%, 50% and 21% for G2 (29.1% of patients), G3 (28.8%), G4 (33.0%) and G5 (9.1%), respectively. OS was significantly shorter in each consecutive G (P = 0.001 for G3, P < 0.001 for both G4 and G5 compared to G2). Similarly, Meet-URO Gs 2-5 showed decreasing median PFS and response rates. The Meet-URO score showed the highest c-index for both OS (0.73) and PFS (0.67). Limitations include the post hoc nature of this analysis and the lack of a comparative arm to assess predictive value.  Conclusion:   The Meet-URO score appeared to show better prognostic classification than the IMDC alone in patients with mRCC at IMDC intermediate-poor risk treated with first-line nivolumab and ipilimumab.""","""['S E Rebuzzi', 'A Signori', 'S Buti', 'G L Banna', 'V Murianni', 'A Damassi', 'M Maruzzo', 'D Giannarelli', 'G Tortora', 'L Galli', 'M Rizzo', 'U De Giorgi', 'L Antonuzzo', 'S Bracarda', 'G Cartenì', 'F Atzori', 'S Tamberi', 'G Procopio', 'L Fratino', 'G Lo Re', 'M Santoni', 'C Baldessari', 'A Astone', 'F Calabrò', 'M Brunelli', 'C Porta', 'P Rescigno', 'U Basso', 'G Fornarini']""","""[' Medical Oncology Unit, San Paolo General Hospital, Savona; Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (Di.M.I.), University of Genova, Genova.', ' Health Sciences, Section of Biostatistics, University of Genova, Genova.', ' Medical Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Parma, Parma; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', ' Department of Oncology, Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.

Preservation procedures such as alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) aim to maintain the 3D volume of the extraction site. This retrospective study analyzed differences in the hard and soft tissue changes in patients treated with either spontaneous healing or ARP.  Methods:   After tooth extraction, the patients were treated either by spontaneous socket healing (SH group) or with ARP using a xenograft and a resorbable membrane (ARP group). One week before and 6 months after extraction, the patients underwent cone beam computed tomography. A volumetric analysis was performed by superimposing the digital models of the two time points. Intraoral radiography was performed after implant placement, upon prosthesis delivery, and at 1-year post-treatment. An esthetic assessment was conducted using the Pink Esthetic Score (PES). The patients' overall satisfaction with the implant restoration was investigated at 12 months.  Results:   Intragroup comparisons revealed significant differences between baseline and the 6-month follow-up in both groups at the measured locations (1 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm below the most coronal aspect of the alveolar ridge) showing a reduction of the horizontal width (P < 0.05). Additionally, after treatment, the horizontal width at 1 mm was significantly different in the SH and ARP groups (P < 0.001), with mean changes of 2.03 ± 0.54 mm and 0.86 ± 0.49 mm, respectively. ARP was associated with an increased PES (11.6 ± 2.2) and a reduction in patients requiring additional grafting procedures in subsequent treatment phases (9% vs 26%; P = 0.11).  Conclusions:   In both groups, significant horizontal and vertical bone loss was observed after the extraction. ARP can reduce linear and volumetric shrinkage of the alveolar ridge, leading to improved outcomes.

To date, there are no data on its prophylactic coanalgesic (opioid-sparing) effect after RT in patients with complicated bone metastases compared to uncomplicated ones, which is the aim of our study.  Methods:   Twenty-nine American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) III-IV patients, aged ≥18, treated with single-fraction 8 Gy/1 or multi-fraction 20 Gy/5 RT for painful uncomplicated bone metastases (steroid naïve patients, n = 14) or complicated ones (steroid non-naïve patients, n = 15), were examined retrospectively. All patients received parenteral dexamethasone (4 mg or 8 mg daily, 1 hour before RT, followed by the same dose for the next 4 days) along with their background and breakthrough pain opioid intake (morphine equivalents) during their 5-day in-hospital stay. Pain severity (numeric rating scale) and analgesic consumption were recorded at admission, daily during the hospital stay, and for 10 days following treatment. Binary logistic regression was used to determine predictive factors for pain flare occurrence.  Results:   A higher ASA score is the only determinant positively influencing opioid consumption (P = 0.018) and pain flare as well (OR = 15.00; 95% CI: 2, 24-100, 48; P = 0.005). Lower dose 4 mg dexamethasone was revealed as a moderate analgesic agent in steroid naïve patients with no side effects, whereas in steroid non-naïve patients the predominantly higher dose 8 mg dexamethasone had minimal impact on pain flares prevention at the expense of more pronounced immunosuppression (P = 0.039).  Conclusions:   Irrespective of the supporting evidence of dexamethasone potential for prevention of RT-induced pain flare, our data failed to reveal its efficacy in the real practice world (a case mix of uncomplicated and complicated bone metastases).

The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of triage nurse-initiated X-ray radiography on length of stay in paediatric emergency admissions.  Methods:   This retrospective, monocentric, descriptive study was performed in two successive 3-month periods: a pre-protocol ('before') period from 3 February to 3 May 2020 and a protocol ('after') period from 4 May to 2 August 2020, when patients underwent nurse-initiated X-ray radiography. The study involved all patients who were aged ≥3 years, valid, non-hyperalgic, accompanied by their parents and consulting at the paediatric ED for a simple closed distal trauma, involving a single limb segment or joint.  Results:   A total of 695 patients were included, 298 in the first period and 397 in the second period. The median length of stay in the paediatric ED was significantly shorter during the second period (119 min [80, 165] vs. 80 min [60, 105], P < 0.001), i.e. a median reduction time of 39 min or 33% (effect size = - 0.68, 95% confidence interval [-0.84 to -0.53]).

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the inflammatory cells and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) in blood could be useful in the diagnosis of allergy in AH. Methods: Two hundred thirty-four children who underwent adenoidectomy were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Blood routine parameters were recorded, and total IgE as well as specific IgE (sIgE) of common allergens were tested perioperatively. The diagnostic utility of blood inflammatory cells and total IgE compared with serum sIgE testing was assessed. Results: In our study, 35.47% of AH children were atopic. Dermatophagoides farinae (d2), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (d1), and mold (mx2) were the most common sensitizing allergens. Significantly elevated eosinophil count, eosinophil to lymphocyte value, and total IgE were found in allergic AH children. As a result of receiver operating characteristic analysis, systemic total IgE could be a method to diagnose allergy in AH with a cutoff value of 46.55 and higher (area under curve [AUC] = 0.837; P < 0.001). Peripheral eosinophil count and eosinophil to lymphocyte were also able to predict positive allergy test result in AH children, with a cutoff value of 0.295 (AUC = 0.721; P < 0.001) and 0.082 (AUC = 0.685; P < 0.001), respectively.

Methods:   We evaluated 138 lesions in 131 patients retrospectively. The IVIM and DKI parameter values were measured by three radiologists with different experiences independently using two different ROI placement methods. IVIM parameters include diffusion coefficient (ADCstand), true diffusion coefficient (ADCslow), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (ADCfast) and perfusion fraction (f). DKI parameters include mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK). Each radiologist measured the lesions twice with a 3-month interval. We utilized intra-class correlation (ICC) to determine the inter- and intra-reader agreement for mass and NME, respectively. ROC analysis compared the diagnostic performance of parameters between different radiologists, ROI methods, and between mass and NME.  Results:   In mass lesions, inter- and intra-observer agreement were perfect for all parameters (ICC: 0.800-989). In NME, the inter-observer agreement was substantial to perfect for all parameters(ICC: 0.703-877), the intra-observer agreement of the senior and intermediate radiologists was substantial to perfect(ICC: 0.748-931) and the intra-observer agreement of the junior radiologist was moderate to substantial(ICC: 0.569-784).

This retrospective study aimed to assess the performance of tumor ghost on post-ablation contrast-enhanced MRI with excellular contrast agent gadolinium-DTPA in evaluating the ablative margin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after microwave ablation (MWA).  Method:   315 HCC lesions less than 5 cm in 287 patients completely treated by MWA were enrolled in the study. The tumor ghost was characterized as a lower signal intensity area than the surrounding tissues of the ablation zone on T1WI imaging. The ablation margin (AM) status was classified into AM0 (＞5mm) and AM1 (＜5mm) according to the minimum distance between the tumor ghost and ablated zone. Inter-observer agreement between two radiologists on the AM assessment was analyzed using the Cohen κ coefficient. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard model was performed to investigate independent risk factors for LTP.  Results:   175 and 140 tumors were evaluated as AM0 and AM1 through tumor ghost. The inter-observer agreement level between two radiologists for assessment of AM was good (κ coefficient = 0.752, 95 % confidence interval: 0.679-0.825, p < 0.001). The mediate follow-up period was 32.2 months (range 3.0-60.8 months). The incidence of LTP in the AM0 lesions and AM1 lesions was 6.3 % (11/175) and 20.0 % (28/140), respectively. AM status was identified as an independent prognostic factor for LTP (HR 3.057, 95 % CI, 1.445-6.470, p = 0.003).

Many existing studies primarily focused on the classification of two classes of brain tumors and the Ki-67LI of gliomas. This study aimed to develop a preoperative non-invasive radiomics pipeline based on multiparametric-MRI to classify-three types of brain tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), metastasis (MET) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), and to predict their corresponding Ki-67LI.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, 153 patients with malignant brain tumors were involved. The radiomics features were extracted from three types of MRI (T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI)) with three masks (tumor core, edema, and whole tumor masks) and selected by a combination of Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR), LASSO, and Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) filters. The performance of six classifiers was compared and the top three performing classifiers were used to construct the ensemble learning model (ELM). The proposed ELM was evaluated in the training dataset (108 patients) by 5-fold cross-validation and in the test dataset (45 patients) by hold-out. The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), F1-Score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) indicators evaluated the performance of the models.  Results:   The best feature sets and ELM with the optimal performance were selected to construct the tri-categorized brain tumor aided diagnosis model (training dataset AUC: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99); test dataset AUC: 0.93) and Ki-67LI prediction model (training dataset AUC: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.98); test dataset AUC: 0.91). The CE-T1WI was the best single modality for all classifiers. Meanwhile, the whole tumor was the most vital mask for the tumor classification and the tumor core was the most vital mask for the Ki-67LI prediction.

Methods:   A total of 47 patients with ALI were retrospectively analyzed. The transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TcPO2) was obtained using laser Doppler blood perfusion monitoring. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) and angiographic images were obtained before and after endovascular intervention. iFlow imaging was used to obtain color-coded images. Regions of interest (ROIs) at the femoral head, knee joint, and ankle joint were selected to obtain the time to peak (TTP). The differences in the TTP between the knee and femoral head regions (TTP difference in the knee area) and between the ankle and knee regions (TTP difference in the ankle area) were observed. The TTP, ABI, and TcPO2 between the complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no response (NR), and amputation (AM) groups were compared. The correlation between TTP changes in the ankle area (ΔTTP) and changes in ABI (ΔABI)/changes in TcPO2 (ΔTcPO2) was analyzed.  Results:   There was a significant increase in both TcPO2 and ABI compared with the pre-intervention values (27.75 ± 5.32 vs 40.92 ± 4.62, and 0.35 ± 0.16 vs 0.79 ± 0.15, respectively, all p < 0.01). The post-intervention TTP differences in the knee areas (5.12 ± 2.45 s) and ankle areas (6.93 ± 4.37 s) were significantly faster than pre-intervention TTP differences (7.03 ± 2.57 s and 10.66 ± 4.07 s, respectively, all p < 0.05). The post-operative TTP in the ankle area, post-operative TTP difference in the ankle area, and ΔTTP in the AM group were higher than the values in the CR and PR groups.

This study aimed to explore the value of the combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC for breast cancer.  Methods:   A total of 119 (range, 28-69 years) patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who received two cycles of NAC before breast surgery were retrospectively enrolled from our hospital database. Patients were divided into pCR and non pCR groups according to their pathological responses; a total of 24 patients achieved pCR, while 95 did not. The quantitative (Ktrans; Kep; Ve; IAUC) and semiquantitative parameters (W-in; W-out; TTP) of DCE-MRI that were significantly different between groups were combined with ADC values to explore their value in the early prediction of pCR to NAC for breast cancer. The independent T test was performed to compare the differences in DCE-MRI parameters and ADC values between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the performance of the prediction.  Results:   The Ktrans, Kep, IAUC, ADC, W-in and TTP values were significantly different between the pCR and non pCR groups after NAC. The AUC (0.845) and specificity (95.79%) of the combined Ktrans, Kep, IAUC and ADC values were both higher than those of the individual parameters. The combination of W-in, TTP and ADC values had the highest AUC value (0.886) in predicting pCR, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 82.11%, respectively.

This case report demonstrates the specificity of multi-myotomal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in detecting acute postoperative C5 palsy following placement of facet spacers. A posterior cervical fusion with decompression and instrumentation involving DTRAX (Providence Medical Technology; Lafayette, CA) was used to treat a patient with cervical stenosis and myelopathy. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) consisting of MEPs, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and free-run electromyography (EMG), was used throughout the procedure. Immediately following the placement of the DTRAX spacers at C4-5, a decrease in amplitudes from the right deltoid and biceps MEP recordings (>65%) was detected. All other IONM modalities remained stable; it is noteworthy that there was an absence of mechanically elicited EMG. A novel post-alert regression analysis trending algorithm of MEP amplitudes confirmed the visual alert. This warning along with an intraoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine subsequently resulted in the decision to remove one of the facet spacers. Surgical intervention did not result in recovery of the aforementioned MEP recordings, which remained attenuated at the time of wound closure.

Results:   A total of 90 RAAs were detected, of which 83 cases were mosaic trisomies and 7 were non-mosaic trisomies. Chromosomes 16, 22, and 9 were identified as the major chromosomes involving RAAs. The four predominant indications for prenatal diagnosis in our RAA cases were RAA-positive in noninvasive prenatal screening, advanced maternal age, ultrasound abnormalities, and high-risk for serum prenatal screening. Cardiovascular defects were the most frequently observed structural abnormalities, followed by musculoskeletal anomalies. Increased nuchal translucency and persistent left superior vena cava, the major soft marker abnormalities involved, were also observed in our RAA cases. Clinical outcomes were available for all RAAs, with 63 induced abortions and 27 live births recorded.  Conclusions:   Variable phenotypes and outcomes were observed, which were highly heterogeneous in cases of prenatal RAAs. Thus, a cautious and comprehensive strategy should be implemented during prenatal counseling for RAAs.""","""['Rong Hu', 'Weiwei Huang', 'Weining Zhou', 'Xiaohui Luo', 'Congmian Ren', 'Huajie Huang', 'Yaping Hou', 'Li Guo', 'Wei He', 'Jian Lu']""","""[' Medical Genetic Center, Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, No.521, Xingnan Road, Panyu District, Guangzhou, 511400, Guangdong, China.', ' Maternal and Children Metabolic-Genetic Key Laboratory, Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, Guangzhou, 511400, China.', ' Medical Genetic Center, Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, No.521, Xingnan Road, Panyu District, Guangzhou, 511400, Guangdong, China. lxjian326@foxmail.com.', ' Maternal and Children Metabolic-Genetic Key Laboratory, Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, Guangzhou, 511400, China. lxjian326@foxmail.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Hum Genomics""","""['Clinical management of pregnancies with positive screening results for rare autosomal aneuploidies at a single center.', 'Pregnancy outcome of autosomal aneuploidies other than common trisomies detected by noninvasive prenatal testing in routine clinical practice.', 'Prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy in singleton pregnancies.', 'Use of a DNA method, QF-PCR, in the prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies.', 'Non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal chromosomal abnormalities by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma DNA: review of 1982 consecutive cases in a single center.']"""

Symptom onset and laboratory characteristics may be confused with those of other respiratory viral infections, including adenovirus pneumonia. We aimed to determine differences in clinical presentations and establish a simple nomogram to differentiate C. psittaci and adenovirus pneumonias.  Methods:   We conducted a multicenter retrospective study in 10 tertiary general hospitals to compare patients with either C. psittaci (n = 78) or adenovirus (n = 102) pneumonia. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors of C. psittaci pneumonia that were used to establish a nomogram.  Results:   C. psittaci and adenovirus pneumonia showed certain similar clinical symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, and fatigue, but differed in other characteristics. The multivariate logistic regression showed that age, sex, nervous system symptoms, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein level, and bilateral lung lesions were risk factors for C. psittaci pneumonia. After incorporating these six factors, the established nomogram achieved a good concordance value (0.949 [95% CI 0.917-0.982]) in differentiating the types of pneumonia, with well-fitting calibration curves.  Conclusion:   Despite having similar clinical features, the variables of age, sex, nervous system symptoms, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein levels, and bilateral lung lesions were combined into a clinically useful nomogram for the rapid and early differentiation of C. psittaci pneumonia from adenovirus pneumonia.

Methods:   This retrospective study included patients with rectal cancer who underwent rectal cancer surgery and DECT (including arterial-, venous-, and delay-phase scanning) between November 2019 and November 2020. The EMVI of rectal cancer was confirmed via postoperative pathological results. Iodine concentration (IC), IC normalized to the aorta (NIC), and CT attenuation values of the three phases were measured and compared between patients with and without EMVI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic performance of these DECT quantitative parameters.  Results:   Herein, 36 patients (22 men and 14 women) with a mean age of 62 [range, 43-77] years) with (n = 13) and without (n = 23) EMVI were included. Patients with EMVI exhibited significantly higher IC in the venous and delay phases (venous-phase: 2.92 ± 0.6 vs 2.34 ± 0.48; delay-phase: 2.46 ± 0.47 vs 1.88 ± 0.35) and NIC in all the three phases (arterial-phase: 0.31 ± 0.12 vs 0.24 ± 0.06; venous-phase: 0.58 ± 0.11 vs 0.41 ± 0.07; delay-phase: 0.68 ± 0.10 vs 0.46 ± 0.08) than patients without EMVI. Among them, the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained in the delay-phase NIC (AUC = 0.983). IC in the arterial-phase and CT attenuation in all the three phases did not significantly differ between patients with and without EMVI (p = 0.205-0.869).

The aim was to investigate the prognostic effect of sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis who received TIPS for prevention of variceal rebleeding.  Method:   We retrospectively included 262 patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS as the first-line treatment for prevention of rebleeding. L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured and sarcopenia was defined using sex-specific cutoffs. Incidence of post-TIPS mortality and overt HE, and changes of L3-SMI before and after TIPS were compared between the non-sarcopenia and sarcopenia group. Moreover, 21 patients with sarcopenia who received TIPS as the second-line treatment were included for additional comparison.  Results:   At admission, 99 (37.8 %) and 163 (62.2 %) patients were diagnosed as sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia, respectively. Compared with the non-sarcopenia group, the sarcopenia group had a similar risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-1.96, p = 0.900) and overt HE (adjusted HR 1.20, 95 %CI 0.72-2.00, p = 0.479).

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis on 40 pregnant patients (out of 8000 pregnant patients) whose fetuses had CH from November 2016 to June 2021. Villus, amniotic fluid, or umbilical cord blood samples were collected, based on the corresponding gestational age, for karyotype analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-array).  Results:   Among the 40 fetuses with CH, 16 (40.0%, 16/40) exhibited isolated CH and 24 (60.0%, 24/40) exhibited CH combined with other ultrasound abnormalities. The most common CH-comorbid ultrasound abnormalities observed in this study were congenital heart disease (25.0%, 6/24), thickened nuchal translucency (20.8%, 5/24), and fetal edema (12.5%, 3/24). Karyotype and SNP-array analysis resulted in an overall detection rate of 30.0% (12/40). Karyotype analysis led to the detection of eight cases of pathogenic CNVs, among which 45, X was the most common. In addition to the above pathogenic CNV, four additional cases were detected by SNP-array. There was no significant difference in the observed pathogenic CNVs between isolated CH and CH combined with other ultrasound (31.3% vs 29.2%, P > .99). Karyotype analysis and SNP-array results influence whether parents terminate the pregnancy. When genetic abnormalities are detected in the fetus, the parents often choose to terminate the pregnancy.  Conclusions:   Our study emphasizes that genomic examination should be performed on fetuses with CH to confirm the etiology as soon as possible. During genetic counseling, all fetal characteristics should be carefully and comprehensively evaluated.""","""['Meiying Cai', 'Nan Guo', 'Na Lin', 'Hailong Huang', 'Liangpu Xu']""","""[' Medical Genetic Diagnosis and Therapy Center, Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine for Obstetrics & Gynecology and Pediatrics, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Key Laboratory for Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Defect, Fuzhou, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Genomic microarray in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency and normal karyotype: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prenatal management, pregnancy and pediatric outcomes in fetuses with septated cystic hygroma.', 'Analysis for the pregnancy outcome of cystic hygroma fetuses and correlation with increased nuchal translucency in first trimester.', 'Karyotype and outcome of fetuses diagnosed with cystic hygroma in the first trimester in relation to nuchal translucency thickness.', 'Cytogenetic evaluation of cystic hygroma associated with hydrops fetalis, oligohydramnios or intrauterine fetal death: the roles of amniocentesis, postmortem chorionic villus sampling and cystic hygroma paracentesis.', 'Xp22.31 copy number variations in 87 fetuses: refined genotype-phenotype correlations by prenatal and postnatal follow-up.']"""

Nearly 2-thirds of patients with PH die within 5 years. Studies suggest that a new diuretic medication, called tolvaptan (TLV), can be used to treat PH. However, there is still insufficient evidence to confirm its effectiveness. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLV in patients with PH. This retrospective study included 73 patients with PH hospitalized in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between November 2019 and March 2022. All patients received 7.5 to 15.0 mg of TLV for 3 to 21 days starting at admission, in addition to targeted drugs and traditional diuretic therapy. The outcomes included the blood pressure, urine and water intake volumes, electrolyte concentrations, and renal, liver, and cardiac function indexes before and after TLV treatment. In addition, we assessed the clinical symptoms and adverse reactions during the treatment. After TLV treatment, the water intake and urine volumes significantly increased, and body weight, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure significantly decreased. Total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and serum uric acid (UA) levels after TLV treatment were significantly lower than before treatment. After TLV treatment, dyspnea significantly improved in 71 of 73 patients, and lower limb edema disappeared in 42 of 53 patients. No obvious adverse reactions occurred during the TLV treatment period. These results suggest that adding TLV to targeted drug and traditional diuretic therapies is effective for patients with PH.

[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT and clinical data from 30 patients with biopsy-proven well-differentiated NETs originating from the hindgut were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed by comparing the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT findings with pathological and/or follow-up data. We also compared the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT results with 2-[18F]FDG and/or 6-[18F]FDOPA PET/CT results in 6 patients. The impact on management was determined in hindsight by comparing the patient management decided before and after the TEP examination based on data from multidisciplinary team meetings. On a patient basis, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT was accurate in 30 of the 30 examinations. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT correctly identified the primary tumor in all patients with primary tumors not resected before the examination and allowed the detection of unexpected distant metastases in 36% of the patients referred for initial staging. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT findings affected patient management in 57% of cases with generally major intermodality changes. Intraindividual comparison of the results of the different PET radiopharmaceuticals showed a clear superiority of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT considering both the number of lesions and the intensity of uptake. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT is an accurate imaging modality for the assessment of well-differentiated colorectal NETs that highly impact patient management.

Methods:   This retrospective study enrolled 439 patients who were assessed for CHE using a neuropsychiatric test between January 2011 and June 2019. A simple CHE (sCHE) score was calculated with hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3.5 g/dL) and hyperammonemia (≥ 80 μg/dL) as 1 point each. The association between sCHE score and CHE or overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) was assessed using logistic regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression models.  Results:   Of 381 eligible patients, 79 (21%) were diagnosed with CHE. The distribution of sCHE scores was 48% with 0 point, 33% with 1 point, and 19% with 2 points. Patients with sCHE score ≥ 1 point had a higher prevalence of CHE than those with sCHE score of 0 (27% vs. 14%, P = 0.002). A cut-off value of 1 point showed high discriminative ability for identifying CHE, with a sensitivity of 0.67, specificity of 0.56, positive predictive value of 0.27, and negative predictive value of 0.86. During the median follow-up period of 2.2 years, 58 (15%) patients developed OHE.

Studies have shown an association between MME and knee pain and that surgical treatment can reduce the extent of MME. Here, we describe the beneficial effects of physical therapy as a feasible conservative treatment for MME.  Methods:   Data of 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises twice a week for 8 weeks were retrospectively analyzed. MME was the measured distance between the medial meniscus and the line connecting the medial borders of the femur and tibia using ultrasound. Ultrasound findings of surrounding tissues, including the deep posterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament (dMCL), were recorded. Additionally, knee extension ROM was measured, and inner knee pain when walking was evaluated using a numerical rating scale.  Results:   There were significant improvements between the baseline and 8 weeks for MME in the non-weight-bearing position (3.6 ± 0.3 mm vs. 3.0 ± 0.4 mm), MME in the weight-bearing position (4.3 ± 0.4 mm vs. 3.8 ± 0.5 mm), ROM (-12.3° ± 4.1° vs. -3.1° ± 3.8°), and knee pain (7.0 ± 0.9 vs. 1.1 ± 1.4) (each p < 0.001). In almost all cases in which the knee extension ROM improved, the dMCL was bulging at the baseline; after 8 weeks, the dMCL was flattened, suggesting ligament tension on ultrasound imaging.  Conclusion:   Stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive ROM exercises may reduce the extent of MME in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The ultrasound findings suggest that improvement in knee extension ROM may have led to the re-acquisition of MCL tension, which may have influenced MME reduction.

The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of uremic patients undergoing deep enteroscopy for OGIB and analyze the risk factors for rebleeding in these patients after undergoing single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE).  Methods:   Out of 765 patients with OGIB who underwent 1004 procedures of SBE in four teaching hospitals, 78 uremic patients with OGIB were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and endoscopic findings were collected, and multiple variables were analyzed to determine the risk of rebleeding after SBE.  Results:   The diagnostic yield was 75.6%, and the rebleeding rate was 29.5% in the enrolled uremic patients. The most common etiology was angiodysplasia (74.6%) and the most common site was the jejunum (50.8%). The endoscopic intervention rate was 62.8% and most patients were treated with argon plasma coagulation (75.6%). Among the eight patients with valvular heart disease (VHD), four (50%) had severe aortic stenosis, and the remaining had non-aortic stenosis-VHD. VHD (p < 0.05) and angiodysplasia (p < 0.05) were both associated with a higher rebleeding rate.

Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent kidney stone surgery in a urology clinic from a tertiary health care institution with f-URS were enrolled in the study. Patient characteristics, the properties of kidney and kidney stones were recorded. Also, f-URS-related parameters, hospitalization time, the success of the procedure, and complications were noted. Patients were categorized equally into 4 groups, the first 20 f-URS cases in Group 1, and the last 20 f-URS cases in Group 4. Groups were compared according to patient preoperative parameters, intraoperative outcomes, success rate and complication rate.  Results:   Time from the induction of anaesthesia to insertion of flexible ureterorenoscope was 18.6 min in group 1 and 17.2 min in group 2; then it significantly decreased to 15.0 min for cases 40 through 60 and 12.4 min for cases 60 through 80 (p = 0.001). Operation time in group 3 and group 4 was significantly shorter than in group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.001). Also, fluoroscopy time was significantly longer in group 1 (82.9 seconds) and reached a plateau in group 3 (50.3 seconds) and group 4 (41.7 seconds) (p = 0.001). Additionally, after the 20th case, we achieved a significantly higher success rate in comparison to the first 20 cases (65% in group 1, 85% in group 2, 85% in group 3, and 90% in group 4, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   Flexible ureterorenoscopy is a surgery that requires high technique and experience. The present study found that success of f-URS reached satisfactory levels after 20th cases.

COVID-19 patients manifest various symptoms from mild to severe cases with poor clinical outcomes. Prognostic values of novel markers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio (CLR) calculated from routine laboratory parameters have recently been reported to predict severe cases; however, whether this investigation can guide oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the ability of these markers in screening and predicting types of oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients. The retrospective data of 474 COVID-19 patients were categorized into mild and severe cases and grouped according to the types of oxygen therapy requirement, including noninvasive oxygen support, high-flow nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilator. Among the novel markers, the ROC curve analysis indicated a screening cutoff of CRP ≥ 30.0 mg/L, NLR ≥ 3.0 and CLR ≥ 25 in predicting the requirement of any type of oxygen support. The NLR and CLR with increasing cut-off values have discriminative power with high accuracy and specificity for more effective oxygen therapy with a high-flow nasal cannula (NLR ≥ 6.0 and CLR ≥ 60) and mechanical ventilator (NLR ≥ 8.0 and CLR ≥ 80).

Methods:   Women who underwent MRI and were surgically confirmed with OSGTs between January 2015 and January 2022 were included in the study. Histology was used as a primary method of diagnosis. T1WI, T2WI, and DWI MR scans were performed for all patients. All MR images were reviewed by two radiologists. The clinic baseline characteristics of all patients were recorded.  Results:   A total of 58 patients were enrolled, with 21 OGCTs found in 20 patients and 39 other OSGTs found in 38 patients. In terms of clinical, the proportion of vaginal discharge/bleeding and menstrual abnormalities were significantly higher in OGCTs than in the control group. A multivariate analysis of the combined clinical MRI revealed that symptomatic, T2 signals of the solid component, Honeycomb-sign, Swiss cheese-sign, and ADC values were independent features for discriminating between OGCTs and other OSGTs. Clinical features, MRI features, and a combined model were established; the areas under the curve of the three models in predicting OGCTs and other OSGTs were 0.694, 0.852, and 0.927, respectively. The DeLong test showed that the combined model had the highest efficiency in predicting OGCTs (p < 0.05), which was significantly different from the AUC of the other two models (p < 0.05).

This study aimed at investigating the role of early and late lymphoscintigraphy.  Material and methods:   From January 2015 to January 2019, early and late lymphoscintigraphies of 52 women were retrospectively analyzed. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed 30 minutes (early) and 2.5-4 hours (late) after vulvar injection of 99m Tc-labeled nanocolloid. We calculated the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between number of sentinel lymph nodes detected on both images using the Lins concordance coefficient and correlated with clinicopathological data.  Results:   Thirty-four women had a midline tumor and 18 had a lateral tumor. Detection rates with early and late scintigraphy were 88.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Median number of detected nodes was 1.0 (0-7) and 2.0 (0-7). Good statistical correlation between number of sentinel lymph nodes detected on early and late imaging was found (CCC = 0.76) in most patients. In 18 women (35%) a mismatch occurred: a higher number of nodes was detected on late imaging. In 11 of 18 women re-injection was performed because no sentinel lymph nodes were visualized on early images. Late imaging and intraoperative detection showed a good statistical correlation (CCC = 0.61). One woman showed an isolated groin recurrence despite negative sentinel lymph nodes.  Conclusions:   This study showed good statistical correlations between early and late scintigraphy in most patients. However, in 35% of women late scintigraphy detected more nodes. In case of poor visualization after the first scintigraphy, re-injection should be considered. Late scintigraphy is probably helpful in confirming successful re-injection and in showing deviating lymph flow in women with failed mapping after the first injection and successful re-injection. Because missing metastatic sentinel lymph nodes often leads to a poor prognosis, we prefer optimal correlations between imaging and intraoperative identification. Hence, late scintigraphy cannot be safely omitted.""","""['Daniek Thissen', 'Joanne A de Hullu', 'Marcel J R Janssen', 'Johanna W M Aarts']""","""[' Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', ' Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', ' Department of Gynecological Oncology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand""","""['Contribution of nuclear medicine to lymphatic mapping and sentinel node identification in oncology.', 'Validation of the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with vulvar cancer: results of a multicenter study in Germany.', 'Multimodal surgical guidance towards the sentinel node in vulvar cancer.', 'Intraoperative sentinel node identification in early stage cervical cancer using a combination of radiolabeled albumin injection and isosulfan blue dye injection.', 'Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar carcinoma: update from a European expert panel.']"""

The real benefit of such routine surveillance imaging in RMS remains to be demonstrated, however. This retrospective, single-center study examines how well surveillance imaging identifies recurrent tumors and its impact on post-relapse survival.  Methods:   The analysis concerned 79 patients <21 years old treated between 1985 and 2020 whose initially localized RMS relapsed. Clinical findings, treatment modalities, and survival were analyzed, comparing patients whose relapse was first suspected from symptoms they developed (clinical symptoms group) with those whose relapse was identified by radiological surveillance (routine imaging group).  Results:   Tumor relapses came to light because of clinical symptoms in 42 cases, and on routine imaging in 37. The time to relapse was much the same in the two groups. The median overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS rate were, respectively, 10 months and 12.6% in the clinical symptoms group, and 11 months and 27.5% in the routine imaging group (p-value .327). Among patients with favorable prognostic scores, survival was better for those in the routine imaging group (5-year OS 75.0% vs. 33.0%, p-value .047).

Because of its unique location and the potential of massive intraoperative bleeding, diagnosis and surgical intervention of VEDH may be challenging.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 32 patients with VEDH was undertaken to investigate the prognostic factor and therapeutic strategy of VEDH. Special attention was paid to the relationship between fracture pattern, surgical method, intraoperative blood loss and outcome.  Results:   Patients treated surgically had a higher percentage of consciousness disturbance and a significantly larger size of VEDH compared with patients treated conservatively (p = 0.029 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Bleeding from the injured superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was noted in six of nine patients (67%) with a linear fracture parallel to the SSS. Only one patient (20%) with a linear fracture crossing the SSS had bleeding from the injured SSS. Five of eight patients (63%) with sagittal suture diastasis experienced bleeding from the SSS. All patients with massive blood loss and six of seven patients developing intraoperative shock had copious bleeding from the injured SSS. All patients with intraoperative massive bleeding and shock underwent traditional ""simple craniotomy"". No patients undergoing ""strip craniotomy"" experienced massive bleeding. Thrombocytopenia (p = 0.008), headache (p = 0.015), consciousness disturbance (p = 0.043), pupil reactivity (p = 0.010), GCS score (p < 0.0001) and the relationship between skull fracture and the SSS (p = 0.037) were significant prognostic factors.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrated GCS score may be a significant prognostic factor in patients with VEDH. Bleeding from the injured SSS occurred frequently in VEDH patients with a linear skull fracture parallel to the SSS or sagittal suture diastasis and could cause devastating hemorrhage. When operating on such patients, the surgical team should prepare for the possibility of massive blood loss and intraoperative shock.

In this study, we aimed to compare the results of LDN operations using iliac fossa incision and Pfannenstiel incision.  Material and method:   LDN cases performed in our institute between June 2016 and February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with previous abdominal surgery, bleeding coagulation disorders, ectopic kidneys, and patients who were converted to perioperative open surgery were excluded. Demographic data of the patients, operation times, warm ischemia times, complications were recorded and the patients were divided into two groups according to incision types.  Results:   After the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 203 patients were included in the study. Iliac fossa incision was used in 65% of the patients and the Pfannenstiel incision was used in 35% of the patients to remove the donor's kidney. There were no difference in age, body mass index, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores between the two groups. Operation time and warm ischemia time were significantly longer in the Pfannenstiel group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.016 respectively).

Group M used common laryngeal masks and an anesthesia machine for positive pressure ventilation while group P took multifunctional intubation laryngeal masks and used a jet ventilator for normal frequency jet ventilation. The patients' mean arterial pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and the operation time, recovery score and the patients' and doctors' satisfaction levels were compared between the 2 groups.  Results:   Both groups were hemodynamically stable, and their PaO2 levels were significantly higher before the operation than that during and after the operation (P < .05). Compared with group M, the PaCO2 level of group P was more stable both during and after the operation, and this difference was statistically significant (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the 2 group's operating time, recovery score, and patients' satisfaction levels (P > .05). However, the satisfaction levels of doctors in group P were higher than that in group M, and this difference was statistically significant (P < .05).  Conclusion:   As statistics show, the intraoperative hemodynamics and PaO2 and PaCO2 levels were stable, and patients, surgeons and anesthesia operators were satisfied. Therefore, it is feasible to apply multifunctional intubation laryngeal masks with normal frequency jet ventilation in airway interventional therapy and it is a safe and ideal way to ensure ventilation.""","""['Yuan Zhou', 'Jianliang Peng', 'Wujian Zhu', 'Yazhen Ke', 'Ligang Shan']""","""[' Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College, Xiamen, P.R.

A total of 49 patients were analyzed, with a mean CT image follow-up of 41.6 ± 37.6 months. Thirty eight patients had C2 pedicle screw placement, and 11 patients underwent planned C2TLS. AA fusion with bridging bone mass formation was achieved in 45/49 (91.8%) patients. Screw halos were observed in 14/49 (28.6%) patients.

There was no other difference between the 2 groups except that thoracic vertebral fracture was more common in women (P < .05). The VAS of female group and male group were (7.14 ± 0.61) and (7.11 ± 0.51) before operation, (3.05 ± 0.66) and (2.89 ± 0.64) after operation, 1 year after operation (1.10 ± 0.50) and (1.02 ± 0.37). There was no difference in each period between the 2 groups (P > .05). But there was a significant decrease after operation, which was recognized between the 2 groups (P < .05); The activity scores of female group and male group were (3.08 ± 0.48) and (3.07 ± 0.43) before operation, (1.86 ± 0.42) and (1.85 ± 0.50) after operation, 1 year after operation (1.01 ± 0.92) and (1.02 ± 0.14). There was no difference in each period between the 2 groups (P > .05). But there was a significant decrease after operation, which was recognized between the 2 groups (P < .05). Postoperative cement leakage was revealed in 21 cases (12.28%), 16 cases (13.56%) in female group and 5 cases (9.43%) in male group, which was no significant difference between the 2 groups. During the 1-year follow-up, postoperative recurrent vertebral fracture was revealed in 4 cases (2.34%), 2 cases (1.69%) in the female group and 2 case (3.77%) in the male group, which was also no significant difference between the 2 groups.  Conclusion:   Patients treated with PKP can immediately get pain relief and activity function improvement. PKP is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgery for both female and male patients.""","""['Bo Yang', 'Yangxue Zhao', 'Yu Zhao']""","""["" Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", "" Department of Orthopaedics, the Ninth Hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Effect of percutaneous kyphoplasty with different phases bone cement for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.', 'COMPARISON OF EFFECTIVENESS BETWEEN PERCUTANEOUS VERTEBROPLASTY AND PERCUTANEOUS KYPHOPLASTY FOR TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROTIC VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE WITH INTRAVERTEBRAL VACUUM CLEFT.', 'Bilateral percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty through unilateral transverse process-extrapedicular approach for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture of lumbar.', 'Comparison of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and Balloon Kyphoplasty for the Treatment of Single Level Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Meta-analysis of the Literature.', 'Comparison of unilateral versus bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty for the treatment of patients with osteoporosis vertebral compression fracture (OVCF): a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective examination of all mediastinal biopsy procedures between April 2015 and August 2019 was performed at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. We registered patient and procedure characteristics, along with lesion pathology and characteristics including localization according to anatomical and Felson mediastinal compartments.  Results:   The study included 48 procedures, conducted in 45 patients (29 men and 16 women) with a mean age of 60,5 years. Pneumothorax occurred in 12 procedures (60% of the transpulmonary procedures) and pneumomediastinum in 18 procedures (38%). Pneumothorax was only seen in procedures with transpulmonal access. Four of the pneumothorax cases required pleural drainage. Diagnostic yield was 96%. We found significant (p = 0,006), moderate to high association between anatomical compartment localization and histopathological diagnosis (Cramér's V = 0,49) for tumours selected for CT-guided percutaneous biopsy. Felson's compartment division on the other hand, did not show any significant associations.  Conclusion:   We found CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of mediastinal tumours to be an effective and safe procedure with a diagnostic yield of 96%. The main complications were pneumothorax and pnumomediastinum, with a relatively low chest drainage rate.

This retrospective controlled study of 22 patients evaluates whether these positive results can be confirmed in pediatric cardiac surgery. Adhesions were scored from photographs of follow-up interventions by an independent cardiac surgeon blinded to group assignment. The publication provides not only score numbers but also original photographs of all sites for better traceability and transparency. In addition, timesaving due to reduced adhesions was evaluated. Results show a significantly reduced adhesion score for the 4DryField® group. Importantly, this resulted in a significantly shorter period between skin incision and start of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Procedure:   We present our 10-year experience (October 2012 to October 2021) of consecutive allo-HCT in patients with myeloid malignancies treated on the pediatric HCT service and conditioned with myeloablative targeted dose-busulfan (BU), fludarabine (FLU), and melphalan (MEL). Twenty-three children, adolescents, and young adult patients (CAYA) (median age 15.4 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 17), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 4), or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 2) underwent allo-HCT post-BU-FLU-MEL. Four patients had treatment-related AML/MDS. Donor/stem cell source was matched sibling donor (MSD) PBSC (n = 7), matched unrelated donor (MUD) PBSC (n = 2), umbilical cord blood (UCB) (n = 3), or haploidentical-BMT (n = 11). Risk stratification was low (n = 2), intermediate (n = 15), high (n = 3), and very high risk (n = 1). The two patients with CML had failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 41.6 months, the relapse rate is only 4.5% with an overall survival (OS) 100%, progression-free survival (PFS) 95.5%, and graft-versus-host-free-relapse-free survival (GRFS) 67.8%. The donor source and the acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis regimen significantly impacted grade II-IV aGvHD 66.7% versus 19.2% (p = .039) and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) 66.7% versus 0% (p = .002) in the patients receiving MSD or MUD PBSC compared to haplo-BMT, respectively, resulting in improved GRFS in haplo-BMT, 83.3% compared to 40% matched donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) (p = .025).  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that BU-FLU-MEL is efficacious conditioning for disease control in young patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing MSD or alternative donor allo-HCT, but in the setting of PBSC grafts with cyclosporine A-methotrexate (CSA-MTX) GvHD prophylaxis, it results in an unacceptably high incidence of GvHD.""","""['Laurel Truscott', 'Holly Pariury', 'Santosh Hanmod', 'Monica Davini', 'Michelina de la Maza', 'Lauren N Sapp', 'Kyleigh Staples', 'Maria Proytcheva', 'Emmanuel Katsanis']""","""[' Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ' The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ' Banner University Medical Center, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ' Banner Desert Medical Center, Mesa, Arizona, USA.', ' Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ' Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ' Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.']""","""2023""","""2023 Feb""","""Pediatr Blood Cancer""","""['Peritransplantation Glucocorticoid Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation Is a Promising Strategy for AML Patients With High Leukemic Burden: Comparison With Transplantations Using Other Donor Types.', 'Comparable outcomes among unmanipulated haploidentical, matched unrelated, and matched sibling donors in BU-based myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for intermediate and adverse risk acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission: a single-center study.', 'Reduced-Intensity Conditioning with Busulfan, Fludarabine, and Antithymocyte Globulin for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation from Unrelated or Haploidentical Family Donors in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission.', 'Myeloablative Versus Reduced-Intensity Conditioning With Fludarabine/Busulfan for Myelodysplastic Syndrome: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.', 'Outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from HLA-matched sibling donor for 41 cases of severe aplastic anemia.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-seven CND patients with modiolar deficiency-type malformations who underwent CI surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Modiolar deficiency-type malformations included common cavity (CC), cochlear hypoplasia (CH) (including CH-I and CH-II) and incomplete partition-I (IP-I). Categorical auditory performance (CAP) and the infant-toddler meaningful auditory integration scale (MAIS) were used to assess auditory ability. The speech intelligibility rating (SIR) and meaningful use of speech scale (MUSS) were used to assess the speech intelligibility of these CI patients. The CI outcomes were evaluated at 0, 12, 24 and 36 months after implant activation.  Results:   All patients demonstrated improvements in auditory ability and speech intelligibility after CI. There were no significant differences in CI outcomes at any time point according to the malformation type. The number of nerve bundles within the internal auditory canal (IAC) showed significant differences at 12, 24 and 36 months after CI ( p < 0.05). Patients with one nerve bundle had relatively poor CI outcomes.

The extent of corpus callosum involvement, however, ranges from partial unilateral to complete bilateral infiltration. The role of surgery in glioblastoma with corpus callosum involvement is controversial. In this study, we aimed to examine prognostic differences between glioblastoma with unilateral and glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration, and to evaluate possible treatment strategy implications. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from 2010 to 2019 were included. Corpus callosum infiltration was assessed in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Extent of resection, adjuvant treatments and overall survival were evaluated. Corpus callosum involvement was found in 96 (26.4%) out of 363 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Bilateral corpus callosum infiltration was found in 27 out of 96 patients (28%), and 69 patients had unilateral corpus callosum infiltration. Glioblastoma with corpus callosum affection had significantly lower median overall survival compared to glioblastoma without corpus callosum involvement (9 vs. 11 months, p = 0.02). A subgroup analysis of glioblastoma with unilateral corpus callosum infiltration revealed a significant difference in median overall survival dependent on extent of resection (6.5 without gross total resection vs. 11 months with gross total resection, Log-rank test p = 0.02). Our data confirms a shorter overall survival in glioblastoma subpopulation with corpus callosum involvement, especially for glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration. However, patients with partial corpus callosum infiltration undergoing gross total resection exhibited a significant survival benefit compared to their counterparts without gross total resection. Whenever reasonably achievable gross total resection should be considered as an integral part of the treatment strategy in glioblastoma with partial corpus callosum infiltration.""","""['Mohammad Hazaymeh', 'Ronja Löber-Handwerker', 'Katja Döring', 'Tammam Abboud', 'Dorothee Mielke', 'Veit Rohde', 'Vesna Malinova']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Göttingen, Georg-August-University, Robert-Koch-Straße 40, 37075, Göttingen, Germany.', ' Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Göttingen, Georg-August-University, Robert-Koch-Straße 40, 37075, Göttingen, Germany. vesna.malinova@gmail.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Sci Rep""","""['Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy for Glioblastoma of the Corpus Callosum.', 'Safety Analysis of Bilateral Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy for Treatment of Butterfly Glioma.', 'Safety and outcomes of resection of butterfly glioblastoma.', 'Surgery for IDH1/2 wild-type glioma invading the corpus callosum.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.']"""

However, little was known about such relationship and its effect in clinical practice among specialists in respiratory medicine.  Methods:   Based on the retrospective analysis of payment data made available by all 92 pharmaceutical companies in Japan, this study evaluated the magnitude and trend of financial relationships between all board-certified Japanese respiratory specialists and pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2019. Magnitude and prevalence of payments for specialists were analyzed descriptively. The payment trends were assessed using the generalized estimating equations for the payment per specialist and the number of specialists with payments.  Results:   Among all 7,114 respiratory specialists certified as of August 2021, 4,413 (62.0%) received a total of USD 53,547,391 and 74,195 counts from 72 (78.3%) pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2019. The median (interquartile range) 4-year combined payment values per specialist were USD 2,210 (USD 715-8,178). At maximum, one specialist received USD 495,332 personal payments over the 4 years. Both payments per specialist and number of specialists with payments significantly increased during the 4-year period, with 7.8% (95% CI: 5.5-9.8; p < 0.001) in payments and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.61-2.4; p = 0.001) in number of specialists with payments, respectively.

Among the 172 AML patients analysed, 48.3% (n = 83) were females. Median age was 31.5 years (range 14 to 62 years), two patients was more than 60 years old (1.2%). Median follow-up was 44 months (range 1 to 94 months). According to the AML-DRG model, 109, 49 and 14 patients were in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively.

However, in contrast to lobectomy, the oncological outcomes after segmentectomy for primary squamous cell carcinomas remain unknown; hence, this study investigated these outcomes.  Methods:   Patients who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy for clinically node-negative primary lung squamous cell carcinoma with a whole tumor size of ≤ 30 mm on preoperative computed tomography scan during April 2010 to December 2020 were included in this study. The cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) among all included patients and propensity score-matched patients were compared using the Gray method. Multivariate analysis using propensity scores and surgical procedures was performed using the Fine and Gray method.  Results:   Overall, 230 patients were included in this study; of these, 172 (74.8%) underwent lobectomy and 58 (25.2%) underwent segmentectomy. No significant differences were observed in the CIR between patients who underwent lobectomy and those who underwent segmentectomy (5-year rate 18.1% vs. 14.2%; p = 0.787). Moreover, no significant differences in CIR were observed between the propensity score-matched patients who underwent lobectomy (n = 43) and those who underwent segmentectomy (n = 43) (8.6% vs. 8.0%; p = 0.571). Multivariable analysis was performed for CIR using the propensity score; it revealed that segmentectomy was not a significant predictor of worse CIR (hazard ratio, 0.987; p = 0.980).

Methods:   This study included patients with IMA who underwent curative resection. Their clinicopathological outcomes were compared with those of patients with INMA. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the prognosis of IMA with IASLC grade 2 or 3. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to analyze recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   The prognoses of IMA and IASLC grade 2 were similar in terms of RFS and OS. Although patients with IMA had better RFS than patients with IASLC grade 3, the OS was not significantly different. After propensity score matching, IMA demonstrated similar RFS to IASLC grade 2 but superior to IASLC grade 3; there was no difference in the OS compared with grades 2/3. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20, p = 0.028), lymphovascular invasion (HR = 127.5, p = 0.003), and maximum standardized uptake value (HR = 1.24, p = 0.005) were poor prognostic predictors for RFS.

The aim of the study was to identify factors which influence the possibility of eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). Patient records, imaging, nTMS examinations and tractography were retrospectively evaluated. 48 nTMS examinations were performed in 46 brain tumor patients. Reproducible MEPs were recorded in 20 patients (41.67%).

In the surgery, a bAM was used to cover the macular area, and C3F8 tamponade was performed on these patients. Phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens implantation was performed simultaneously in patients who had cataracts. Patients were followed up for at least half a year. The main outcomes were whether the macular hole closed, the morphological changes in the macular graft, the best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) and other indicators. In all eyes, the recurrent macular holes were closed. Two cases (8.69%, 2/23) had bAM shifting half a month after surgery, and these patients underwent a second surgery to adjust the position of the bAM and perform C3F8 tamponade.

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and clinical index of stable febrile neutropenia (CISNE) scores have been widely used to predict the risk of severe medical complications in patients with FN; however, there are few tools for predicting chemotherapy delays or discontinuation after FN.  Methods:   Patients admitted to two university hospitals between 2014 and 2018 with a FN diagnosis during the first cycle of chemotherapy for lung cancer were reviewed retrospectively.  Results:   Among 539 patients who received 813 courses of chemotherapy for lung cancer, 49 (9%) developed FN during the first treatment cycle. Although all the patients recovered from their primary infection, 19 patients (38.8%) developed serious medical complications, 11 (22.4%) were unable to resume chemotherapy and one (2.0%) declined to resume chemotherapy, and nine (18.4%) died within 90 days. Patients who failed to resume chemotherapy had a lower MASCC score (median 8.5 vs. 17, p < 0.01) and a higher CISNE score (median 3 vs. 1, p < 0.01) at the onset of FN. The specificity to predict the patient who failed to resume chemotherapy was 90% or more with MASCC score ≤9 or CISNE score ≥3, with the sensitivity of 61%. MASCC score ≤ 16 can also be a sensitive indicator with the sensitivity and specificity of 89 and 52%, respectively.

The Purpose of this prospective intraindividual study was to conduct a quantitative and qualitative head-to-head comparison of DCE-MRI using HSCA and ECA in patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC. Twenty-three patients with liver cirrhosis and proven HCC underwent two 3 T-MR examinations, one with ECA (gadoteric acid) and the other with HSCA (gadoxetic acid). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), wash-in, wash-out, image quality, artifacts, lesion conspicuity, and major imaging features of LI-RADS v2018 were evaluated. Wash-in and wash-out were significantly stronger with ECA compared to HSCA (P < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). During the late arterial phase (LAP), CNR was significantly lower with ECA (P = 0.005), while SNR did not differ significantly (P = 0.39). In qualitative analysis, ECA produced a better overall image quality during the portal venous phase (PVP) and delayed phase (DP) compared to HSCA (P = 0.041 and 0.008), showed less artifacts in the LAP and PVP (P = 0.003 and 0.034) and a higher lesion conspicuity in the LAP and PVP (P = 0.004 and 0.037). There was no significant difference in overall image quality during the LAP (P = 1), in artifacts and lesion conspicuity during the DP (P = 0.078 and 0.073) or in the frequency of the three major LI-RADS v2018 imaging features.

In general, antiviral effects of interferon are partially mediated by a RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that, once activated, inhibits protein synthesis. Indeed, activation of PKR response can inhibit HIV replication. To explore the role of allelic variants in shaping dynamics of commonly monitored HIV biomarkers, CD4 cells, CD8 cells and HIV-load were modelled within a latent class mixed model (LCMM) to account for participants' heterogeneity over time. The estimated models identified two sub-groups from CD4 and HIV-load dynamics, revealing better outcomes for subgroups of participants with the heterozygous CT genotype.

One of the most important types is Morel-Lavallée lesions (MLL); a significant soft-tissue injury associated with pelvic trauma (30%) and thigh (20%), located over the greater trochanter.  Material and methods:   In this retrospective study we selected adult patients diagnosed with MLL between 2010 and 2019 at our trauma center. We then identified 9 cases and followed them up for a minimum of two years. CT scans were performed to measure the size of the degloved zone.  Results:   we did not found direct relationship between greater dimensions of MLL injury and the need for an increase of days to return to work. We rather identified an association between bigger dimensions of MLL injury and higher energy trauma. These patients waited an average of 133 days to return to work after being injured; which is a longer period compared to non-op patients.  Discussion:   MLL lesions generally take several days to develop and many may be missed on initial evaluation. Once identified, compression dressings should be applied, especially when diagnosed acutely. Early identification would lead to early operative debridement. Also, drainage should be performed, since the pathophysiology of the injury will result in the failure of observation or simple aspiration.  Conclusion:   MLL diagnosis and treatment must be identified as early as possible. We didn't find a correlation between MLL size and the treatment performed. In our study all patients returned to their jobs and normal life. Patients following conservative treatment take longer time to recover and could require more patient's implication, but -at least- would avoid possible surgical complications.""","""['Juan Miguel Rodríguez-Roiz', 'Jordi Montañana Burillo', 'José Simón Sanchez Díaz']""","""[' Orthopaedic & Trauma Surgery Department, Mutua Universal Delfos Clinic, Vallcarca Av 151, Barcelona, Spain; Quiron Aribau Barcelona, Orthopaedics Department, Aribau 192,198, Barcelona, Spain.

Comparing the two groups, after IPTW adjustment, there were no statistically significant differences in PaO2 improvement (adjusted mean ratio [MR] 2.81; 95% CI -5.82 to 11.43; p = .524), intubation rate (adjusted OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.44 to 6.92; p = .423), ventilator-free days (adjusted MR 0.00; 95% CI -8.84 to 8.85; p = .999), hospital length of stay (adjusted MR 3.04; 95% CI -2.62 to 8.69; p = .293), and 28-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.98; p = .608).  Conclusion:   HFNC may be beneficial in COVID-19 HRF. NRB + NC is a viable alternative, especially in resource-limited settings, given similar improvement in oxygenation at two hours, and no significant differences in long-term outcomes. The effectiveness of NRB + NC needs to be investigated by a powered randomized controlled trial.""","""['Muhammad Khidir Mohd Kamil', 'Khadijah Poh Yuen Yoong', 'Abdul Muhaimin Noor Azhar', 'Aida Bustam', 'Ahmad Hariz Abdullah', 'Mohd Hafyzuddin Md Yusuf', 'Aliyah Zambri', 'Ahmad Zulkarnain Ahmad Zahedi', 'Hidayah Shafie']""","""[' Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

To evaluate the factor structure, construct validity, and criterion validity of the Pica ARFID and Rumination Disorder Interview (PARDI; ARFID module), we administered the PARDI to 129 children and adolescents ages 9-23 years (M = 16.1) with ARFID (n = 84), subclinical ARFID (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 34).  Method:   We used exploratory factor analysis to examine the factor structure of the PARDI in children, adolescents, and young adults with an ARFID diagnosis, the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Spearman correlations to test the construct validity of the measure, and non-parametric receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate the criterion validity of the PARDI.  Results:   Exploratory factor analysis yielded a 3-factor structure: (1) concern about aversive consequences of eating, (2) low appetite/low interest in food, and (3) sensory sensitivity. Participants with ARFID demonstrated significantly higher levels of sensory sensitivity, low appetite/low-food interest, and concern about aversive consequences of eating symptoms relative to control participants. The construct validity for each PARDI subscale was supported and clinical cutoffs for the low appetite/low interest in food (1.1) and sensory sensitivity subscales (0.6) were established.  Discussion:   These data present evidence for the factor structure and validity of the PARDI diagnostic interview for diagnosing ARFID in children, adolescents, and young adults, supporting the use of this tool to facilitate ARFID clinical assessment and research.  Public significance:   Due to the paucity of validated diagnostic interviews for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), we evaluated the factor structure and validity of the Pica ARFID and Rumination Disorder Interview (ARFID module).

The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of the EU-TIRADS score in Congolese hospitals, using pathological examination after surgery as the gold standard in Congolese hospitals. This retrospective and analytical study examined clinical, ultrasound and pathological data of 549 patients aged 45 ± 14 years, including 468 females (85.2%), operated for thyroid nodule between January 2005 and January 2019. In the present study, only the highest graded nodule according to the EU-TIRADS score in each patient was taken into account for the statistical analyses. So 549 nodules were considered. Nodules classified EU-TIRADS 2 and 3 on the one hand, and, on the other hand, 4 and 5, were considered respectively at low and high risk of malignancy. The sensitivity and specificity of the EU-TIRADS score were calculated. The significance level was set at 5%. Of all patients, 21.7% had malignant nodules. They made 48.4% of the nodules in patients younger than and at 20 years old, and 31.1% in those aged 60 or over. Malignant nodules were more frequent in men than in women (30.9% vs. 20.1%; p = 0.024). Papillary carcinoma (67.2%) and follicular carcinoma (21.8%) were the main types. The malignancy rate was 39.7% and 1.5% among nodules rated EU-TIRADS 4 and 5, and those with EU-TIRADS score 2 and 3, respectively (p < 0.001). The EU-TIRADS score had a sensitivity of 96.6% and a specificity of 59.3%. The ROC curve indicated an area under the curve of 0.862. In a low-income country, a well performed thyroid ultrasound, using the EU-TIRADS score, could be an important tool in the selection of thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy and requiring histopathological examination in the Congolese hospital setting.Trial registration: The research protocol had obtained the favorable opinion of the DRC national health ethics committee no. 197/CNES/BN/PMMF/2020.

A total of 167 patients who received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer treatment from January 2010 to August 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in the patient groups stratified by prostate volume and the amount of testosterone reduction were assessed every 4 weeks until 12 weeks after androgen deprivation therapy initiation. Longitudinal mixed models were used to assess the adjusted effects of prostate volume and testosterone reduction on IPSS change. All mean values of IPSS-total score (IPSS-total), voiding subscore (IPSS-vs), and storage subscore (IPSS-ss) significantly decreased from baseline to week 12 in both patients with small (< 33 mL) and large (≥ 33 mL) prostates. The mean values of IPSS-total, IPSS-vs, and IPSS-ss similarly decreased in patients with large prostate with a baseline IPSS-total of ≥ 13. However, in those with small prostate, IPSS-ss specifically remained unchanged, while IPSS-total and IPSS-vs significantly decreased. In addition, only in patients with small prostate (< 33 mL), patients with lesser testosterone reduction (< Δ400 ng/dL) showed greater improvement in IPSS-ss by 7.5% compared with those with greater testosterone reduction (≥ Δ400 ng/dL). In conclusion, although androgen deprivation therapy generally improves lower urinary tract symptoms, it may worsen specifically storage symptoms in patients with relatively small prostate and greater testosterone reduction.

In both groups, the body surface projection points of viewing hole (V), main and accessory operating holes (O1 and O2) and surface display of fundus (F) were connected to form a geometric figure. The accessibility of the surgical instrument into the fundus, the need for elongated instruments and related intra- and post-operative parameters were noted. The overweight and obese subjects showed a significant increased U-X and U-F interval compared to the non-obese subjects. The length of both U-X and U-F interval were correlated with the BMI. The geometric figure is quite different between L and C approach with significant increase of area of quadrangle.

Osteolysis occurred in all patients with type 1 acromion, 7 patients with type 2 acromion, and 5 patients with type 3 acromion. Since the hook tip in the sagittal plane passes posterior to the center of the acromion and the concavity of the subacromial surface is inadequate in the type 1 acromion, we believe that the increased pressure applied by the hook tip on the subacromial cartilage increases the risk of SAO.

Design:   Retrospective study.  Setting:   Clinics at a tertiary-level pediatric medical center.  Patients:   Fifty-five patients (55 ankles) who presented with JOCD.  Interventions:   Patients were managed with cast immobilization followed by activity restriction.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome measure of progressive lesion reossification was determined from the latest radiograph, after at least 6 months of nonoperative treatment. Final clinical evaluation was performed by a questionnaire and complementary telephone interview. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the influence of age, sex, lesion size, classification, location, duration of symptoms, containment lesion, and the occurrence of cyst-like lesions on healing potential.  Results:   After nonoperative treatment, 18 (33%) of 55 lesions had failed to progress toward healing. An older age (P = 0.034) and a completely detached but undisplaced (grade III) lesion (P < 0.001) at the time of diagnosis were predictive for the failure of conservative treatment. A multivariate logistic regression best predictor model that included age and grade resulted in the best predicted healing and yielded an area under the curve of 0.920 (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In two-thirds of skeletally immature patients, conservative treatment resulted in the progressive healing of JOCD of the talus. For older patients with grade III lesions showing a lower healing probability, surgical treatment should be considered.""","""['Hyun Woo Kim', 'Kun-Bo Park', 'Chan Woo Kim', 'Koo Yeon Lee', 'Hoon Park']""","""["" Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea ; and."", ' Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea .']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Clin J Sport Med""","""['Healing predictors of stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans knee lesions after 6 and 12 months of nonoperative treatment.', 'Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the talus.', 'The healing potential of stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans knee lesions.', 'Treatment of Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Talus in Skeletally Immature Population: A Critical Analysis of the Available Evidence.', 'Treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans and osteochondritis dissecans of the knee.']"""

We aimed to assess the ability of this assay to detect diverse sequence types and validated a simple method to preserve samples. We used this assay on 253 potable and 165 nonpotable cooling tower water samples from various buildings in Québec, Canada, and performed sequence-based typing on 96 isolates. Six sequence types were identified, including ST1, ST378, ST1427, ST2859, ST3054, and ST3069. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that ST2859 was a member of the L. pneumophila subspecies fraseri. Additional tests with pure isolates also found that subspecies Pascullei and Raphaeli could be detected via Legiolert. Eight storage methods, including the current recommendation to store Legiolert trays at 4°C, were evaluated for their ability to preserve viable cultures. Of those, storage of Legiolert culture with 10% glycerol at -80°C produced the best results, fully preserving culturable Legionella for at least 12.5 months. We incorporated these findings into a standard procedure for processing Legiolert packets. Overall, Legiolert captures a variety of common and new STs in addition to important L. pneumophila subspecies and can be easily stored, which allows the conservation of a population of isolates for later characterization. IMPORTANCE Legionnaires' disease is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, which can be found in a variety of water systems. When outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease occur, it is necessary to find the water systems transmitting the bacterium to humans. Access to historical isolates from water system samples is key for success in identifying sources but current regulations and isolation protocols mean very few isolates are obtained and stored long-term. We showed here that the Legiolert test could detect and produce isolates of a variety of L. pneumophila subspecies and types. In addition, the Legiolert test medium containing a representative population of isolates could be preserved for at least 12 months at -80°C with the addition of glycerol to the test medium. Therefore, we confirmed that the Legiolert method could be a useful tool for retrospective analysis of potential sources for an outbreak.""","""['Sara Matthews', 'Hana Trigui', 'Marianne Grimard-Conea', 'Elliston Vallarino Reyes', 'Gabriel Villiard', 'Dominique Charron', 'Emilie Bédard', 'Sébastien Faucher', 'Michèle Prevost']""","""[' Department of Natural Resource Sciences, McGill Universitygrid.14709.3b, Montréal, Québec, Canada.', ' Department of Civil, Geological and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.', ' Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie Porcine et Avicole (CRIPA), Faculté de Médecine Vétérinaire, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.', ' Industrial Chair on Drinking Water, Department of Civil, Geological and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Microbiol Spectr""","""['Comparative study of Legiolert with ISO 11731-1998 standard method-conclusions from a Public Health Laboratory.', 'Comparative genome analysis reveals a complex population structure of Legionella pneumophila subspecies.', 'Evaluation of Legiolert for Quantification of Legionella pneumophila from Non-potable Water.', 'A Supervised Statistical Learning Approach for Accurate Legionella pneumophila Source Attribution during Outbreaks.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.']"""

Clinical phenotype might encompass extra-craniofacial abnormalities, and patients may experience neuropsychiatric disorders with a higher prevalence than healthy controls. To the best of our knowledge, an association between GS and Feeding and Eating Disorders (FED) has never been reported in the literature.  Case report:   A 15-year-old boy with GS was referred to our outpatient clinic due to severe underweight (BMI of 12.7 kg/m2) and food intake disorder with avoidant restrictive features. After a diagnosis of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was made, an inpatient multidisciplinary intervention and outpatient follow-up program were provided, which resulted in the improvement of the boy's weight and FED psychopathology.  Conclusions:   The current report describes the first case of a young male with GS and ARFID. We suggest that ARFID may present itself as part of the spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with the syndrome; since traumatic experiences and gastrointestinal discomfort play a pivotal role in the development of ARFID among children, attention should be paid to those affected by GS that involves crucial structures in the swallowing process. Further literature evidence will help portray the complex relationship between ARFID and GS more precisely.

Although there are a lot of publications about the diagnostic utility of this method in squamous cell lesions, which has advantages such as time-saving and standardization, there are only a few publications on this issue in glandular cell lesions in the literature. We aimed in this study to investigate the diagnostic utility of the system in the detection of premalignant and malignant glandular lesions in cervical smears.  Material and method:   Our study was conducted retrospectively, and a total of 126 cervical smear samples between 2010 and 2022 that have histological confirmation of endometrial adenocarcinoma (EAC), endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECAC), or adenocarcinoma in situ (AİS), were included. These samples were re-evaluated by manual and TIS by two experienced pathologists, and the results were compared in terms of sensitivity.  Results:   We found out that 70 of the 126 smear samples have atypical glandular cells. We detect 48 cases (48/70) (sensitivity 68.5%) in manual examination, however TIS successfully determined 66 cases (66/70) (sensitivity 94.3%). In 4 cases (5.7%) TIS could not detect the atypical cells within the 22 areas.  Conclusion:   TIS is quite an effective method with a high sensitivity for detecting atypical glandular cells in cervical smears, like detecting squamous cell anomalies. Imposing this system in our laboratory and using them appropriately, save us time and help to ensure standardization. Additionally, it may be a good way to adopt artificial intelligence and digital pathology in today's world.""","""['Yasemin Akca', 'Suna Erkilic']""","""[' Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey.']""","""2023""","""2023 Feb""","""Diagn Cytopathol""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Sensitivity and specificity of the Pap smear for glandular lesions of the cervix and endometrium.', 'ThinPrep Pap Test.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively assessed TAE performed after emergency hysterectomy in 15 patients between July 2008 and January 2022. Underlying condition, technical success, clinical success, angiographic findings, laboratory findings, pregnancy-modified DIC score (The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis), blood transfusion, ICU (Intensive care unit) admission day, hospital day, in-hospital mortality, and long-term sequelae were evaluated.  Results:   All patients were diagnosed with DIC before embolization, with a 43.9 mean DIC score. All patients showed positive angiographic findings for active bleeding. Thirty-eight bleeding arteries were confirmed. The remnant uterine artery (n=25) was the most common focus of persistent bleeding, followed by the cervicovaginal artery (n=6), pudendal artery (n=3), obturator artery (n=2), vesical artery (n=1), and unspecified artery from the internal iliac artery (n=1). Technical and clinical success rates were 100% (15/15) and 93.3% (14/15), respectively. Mean nadir hemoglobin (Hb) level before embolization was 4.9 g/dL. All patients underwent massive transfusion before embolization (mean 33.2 packs of RBC). Postoperatively, a smaller amount of blood was transfused than before the procedure (mean 10.6 packs of RBC). Mean nadir Hb level after embolization was 8.2 g/dL. There was one instance each of in-hospital death, hypoxic brain damage, and ischemic acute kidney injury.

We retrospectively investigated local electrograms for slow pathway (SP) modification in cryoablation.  Methods:   Forty-five consecutive patients with slow-fast AVNRT who underwent cryoablation using a 6-mm-tip catheter were enrolled. Electrogram parameters for sites of successful SP modification (success-sites) were investigated; these included the interval between atrial activation at His and the last deflection of SP potential, defined as the His(A)-SPP interval. In 8 patients, 3-dimensional mapping by multi-electrode catheter was performed pre-ablation for more detailed SP assessment.  Results:   Twenty-seven of 45 patients had successful SP modification by 1 cycle of freeze-thaw-freeze cryoablation at a single site with a low amplitude and fragmented SP potential. Among a total of 76 cryoablation sites in all patients, the His(A)-SPP interval at success-sites (45 sites) was significantly longer than that at unsuccess-sites (31 sites) (86 ± 9 vs.78 ± 10 msec, p < 0.0001).

Methods:   Data that were also used in the RESET study were retrospectively collected from 16 hospitals in South Korea. A stratified random sampling method was applied to split the data into training and test sets (70:30 split ratio). Clinical information, such as age, sex, tumor stage, smoking, performance status, metastasis, type of metastasis, dose adjustment, and pathologic information on EGFR mutations were inputted. Training was performed using eight ML algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, deep neural network, random forest, support vector machine, boosting, bagging, and the naïve Bayes classifier. The model performance was assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated and compared between the ML models using DeLong's test. A Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve was used to visualize the identified strata obtained from the ML models.  Results:   No significant differences in the input variables were observed between the training and test datasets. The best-performing models were support vector machine in predicting 1-year afatinib continuation (AUC 0.626) and decision tree in 2-year survival after afatinib start (AUC 0.644), although the performances of the ML models were comparable and did not display any predictive roles. KM analysis and log-rank test revealed significant differences between the strata identified from the ML model (p < 0.001) in terms of both time-on-treatment (TOT) and overall survival (OS).  Conclusion:   The performances of ML models in our study found no discernible roles in predicting afatinib-related outcomes, although the identified strata revealed different TOT and OS in the KM analysis.

We evaluated all pushbutton events for audiovisual characteristics such as whether the event was narrated, whether the patient was blocked on camera, and what diagnostic challenges impaired the electroencephalographer's ability to understand either the reason the event button was pushed or clinical semiology (""electroclinical correlation""). We determined the percent of events and studies with each outcome.  Results:   There were 154 studies with 520 pushbutton events. The pushbutton was most commonly activated by patients (41%), followed by nurses (31%) or family (17%). Twenty-nine percent of events represented electrographic seizures, and 78% occurred in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. The reason for the push was not stated in 45% of events, and inadequate narration impaired electroclinical correlation in 19% of events. At least one relevant part of the patient's body was blocked during 12% of events, but this impaired electroclinical correlation in only 1% of events. There was at least one factor impairing electroclinical correlation in 21% of events, most commonly due to incomplete narration (N = 99), lights off (N = 15), or blankets covering the patient (N = 15). At least one factor impaired electroclinical correlation for any event in 36% of studies.  Conclusion:   Audiovisual factors impairing the electroencephalographer's ability to render an electroclinical correlation were common, particularly related to inadequate narration from bedside observers to explain the reason for pushing the button or event semiology. Future efforts to develop targeted countermeasures should address narration challenges and improve inpatient seizure monitoring quality metrics.""","""['Samuel Waller Terman', ""Susanna S O'Kula"", 'Melissa Marie Asmar', 'Kathryn A Davis', 'Deana M Gazzola', 'Rodica Lesanu', 'Laura George', 'Linda M Selwa', 'Simon M Glynn', 'Chloe E Hill']""","""[' University of Michigan Department of Neurology, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

The aim of the study was to investigate the association between the Strauss criteria, absence of S wave in V5-V6, the Selvester score and response to CRT.  Methods and results:   The retrospective analysis included all consecutive patients having undergone implantation of biventricular defibrillators in primary prevention between 2018 and 2020. The final analysis included 236 patients (mean age 69.7 ± 9.9; 77.5% of males). The Strauss criteria were significantly associated with CRT response (p < 0.01) with a sensitivity of 71.3% and specificity of 64.1%. The Strauss criteria along with the absence of S wave in V5 and V6 showed a sensitivity of 56.7%, a specificity of 82.6% and a positive predictive value of 90.5%. The Selvester score was significantly and inversely associated with CRT response (OR 0.818, 95% CI 0.75-0.89; p < 0.001).

Methods: This single-center retrospective study included children aged 4-13 years with myopia of at least -0.5 diopters (D) treated with 0.05% atropine eye drops from November 2016 to May 2021. Predictive factors for AL change were evaluated using linear mixed models. Results: Among 109 patients (218 eyes), 58 (53.2%) were male and the mean age at treatment was 8.5 ± 2.0 years. At baseline measurement, the mean spherical equivalent was -4.05 ± 2.34 diopters (D), and AL was 25.00 ± 0.97 mm. The mean follow-up duration was 25.4 (12-58) months, and the mean AL elongation was 0.23 ± 0.17 mm/year during the follow-up periods. AL shortening of ≥0.05 mm at subsequent visit occurred in 18 patients (26 eyes). The mean AL change in the group without initial AL shortening was statistically larger than that in the group with initial AL shortening (0.26 ± 0.16 mm/year vs. 0.02 ± 0.17 mm/year, P < 0.001). In linear mixed model, the age at atropine treatment and initial AL shortening were significantly associated with respect to AL growth (beta coefficient: -0.032 and -0.122, respectively, P < 0.001 for both).

Design:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 2879 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy and voice evaluation between January 2014 and December 2019 in a single institute. All the patients had their vocal status assessed using videostroboscopy, acoustic voice analyses, aerodynamic study, and Thyroidectomy-related Voice and Symptom Questionnaire (TVSQ) scores preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. We analysed the pattern of voice changes over time and differences in voice parameters based on clinical factors. To confirm the usefulness of the TVSQ, the correlation between TVSQ scores and objective parameters was analysed. Lastly, predictive factors for persistent voice symptoms were analysed.  Setting:   Tertiary referral hospital.  Results:   The frequency ranges and TVSQ scores exhibited significant deterioration until 6 months following surgery. Among clinical factors, the extents of thyroidectomy and neck dissection were associated with worse voice parameters. The TVSQ score was significantly correlated with objective voice parameters. The extents of thyroidectomy and neck dissection were predictive of persistent voice symptoms at 6 months after thyroidectomy.  Conclusion:   After uncomplicated thyroidectomy, most voice parameters tended to recover, but some parameters remained aggravated even at 6 months after surgery.

The objective of this study is to assess ultrasound characteristics of mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis and effectiveness of intraoperative ultrasound-guided mediastinal nodal dissection in patients with resected NSCLC.  Materials and methods:   All patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy and pulmonary lymphadenectomy from November 2020 to March 2022 at the thoracic surgery department of the Vanvitelli University of Naples underwent intraoperative ultrasound-guided mediastinal lymph nodal dissection.  Results:   This study evaluates whether individual B-mode features and a compounding thereof can be used to accurately and reproducibly predict lymph node malignancy.  Discussion:   Intraoperative ultrasound, during systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection, is helpful in preventing lesion to mediastinal structures. Pathological nodal sonographic characteristics are round shape, short-axis diameter, echogenicity, margin, the absence or presence of coagulation necrosis sign, and the absence or presence of central hilar structure, increased color Doppler flow, the absence or presence of calcification, and nodal conglomeration. Operating time was not substantially prolonged. The procedure is simple, safe and highly accurate.  Conclusions:   Ultrasonic techniques allow surgeons to detect the relationship between lymph nodes and surrounding large blood vessels during biopsy, improving the safety and simplicity of the operation, increasing the number of harvested lymph nodes, and reducing the risk of intraoperative injury; it is a fast, easily reproducible, and inexpensive method.""","""['Gaetana Messina', 'Mary Bove', 'Antonio Noro', 'Giorgia Opromolla', 'Giovanni Natale', 'Rosa Mirra', 'Francesca Capasso', 'Davide Gerardo Pica', 'Vincenzo Di Filippo', 'Mario Pirozzi', 'Marianna Caterino', 'Sergio Facchini', 'Alessia Zotta', 'Rita Polito', 'Giovanni Vicidomini', 'Mario Santini', 'Alfonso Fiorelli', 'Fortunato Ciardiello', 'Morena Fasano']""","""[' Thoracic Surgery Unit, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli, Italy.', ' Oncology, Department of Precision Medicine, Università della Campania ""L.

Although previous studies have demonstrated similar PCI outcomes in surgical centers (SC) versus NSC, it is unknown whether this applies to more complex procedures such as left main stem (LMS) PCI. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes of LMS PCI performed across SC and NSC in England and Wales.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of procedures between January 2006 and March 2020 was performed using the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database and stratified according to the surgical status of the center. The primary outcomes assessed were in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, all-cause mortality, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium stage 3 to 5 bleeding.  Results:   Forty thousand seven hundred forty-four patients underwent LMS PCI during the period, of which 13 922 (34.2%) had their procedure performed at an NSC. The proportion of LMS PCI performed in NSC increased >2-fold (15.9% in 2006 to 36.7% in 2020). There was no association between surgical cover location and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.69-1.22]), in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.79-1.25]), or emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.95-1.06]). NSC had lower Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 to 5 bleeding complications (odds ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.34-0.82]).  Conclusions:   There has been an increase in LMS PCI volumes at NSC, particularly elective LMS PCI. LMS PCI performed at NSC was not associated with increased mortality, in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, or emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery, despite higher disease complexity.""","""['Muhammad Rashid', 'Mahvash Zaman', 'Peter Ludman', 'Harindra C Wijeysundera', 'Nick Curzen', 'Tim Kinnaird', 'Saadiq Moledina', 'J Dawn Abbott', 'Cindy L Grines', 'Mamas A Mamas']""","""[' Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, School of Medicine, Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom (M.R., S.M., M.A.M.).', ' Department of Academic Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom (M.R., S.M., M.A.M.).', ' Department of Cardiology, Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom (M.Z.).', ' Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom (P.L.).', ' Schulich Heart Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (H.C.W.).', ' Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton & Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Southampton, United Kingdom (N.C.).', ' Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom (T.K.).', ' Lifespan Cardiovascular Institute, Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RI (J.D.A.).', ' Department of Cardiology, Northside Hospital Cardiovascular Institute, Atlanta, GA (C.L.G.).']""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""Circ Cardiovasc Interv""","""['Evolution of Left Main Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Should It Occur in Catheterization Laboratories Without On-Site Surgical Back Up.', 'Access Site and Outcomes for Unprotected Left Main Stem Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: An Analysis of the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society\xa0Database.', 'Predictors of 30-day and 12-month mortality in left main stem percutaneous coronary intervention 2016-2020: A study from two UK centers.', 'Outcome of left main stem percutaneous coronary intervention in a UK nonsurgical center: A 5-year clinical experience.', 'Left main coronary artery stenosis: a meta-analysis of drug-eluting stents versus coronary artery bypass grafting.', 'Percutaneous Coronary Intervention at Centers With and Without On-Site Surgical Backup: An Updated Meta-Analysis of 23 Studies.']"""

Objective:   To compare the outcomes of 2 bone graft techniques applied in posterior C1-C2 screw-rod fixation and fusion surgery for treating atlantoaxial dislocation.  Methods:   The data from 55 patients with atlantoaxial dislocation were retrospectively reviewed. The SBG technique had been used in 29 patients and the AIC technique in 26 patients. The outcomes were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association scale score, Neck Disability Index, and visual analog scale score for neck pain and compared between the 2 groups. The donor site complications were also recorded in SBG group, and donor site pain was assessed using a visual analog scale.  Results:   In the final follow-up, the bone fusion rate was 100% in both groups. No significant differences were found in the bone fusion time between the 2 groups ( P > .05). Postoperatively, the Japanese Orthopedic Association, Neck Disability Index, and visual analog scale score for neck pain indexes improved significantly within both SBG (all P < .05) and AIC groups (all P < .05). Nevertheless, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (all P > .05).

In the context of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we describe a case series of patients who developed IgAV following SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Methods:   This national multicenter retrospective study included patients with IgAV following SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2022. Patients had histologically proven IgAV and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. The interval between infection and vasculitis onset had to be < 4 weeks.  Results:   We included 5 patients, 4 of whom were women with a mean age of 45 years. Four patients had paucisymptomatic infections and 1 required a 48-hour low-flow oxygen treatment. All 5 patients had purpuric skin involvement. Arthritis was observed in 2 patients, 3 had IgA glomerulonephritis, and 2 had digestive involvement. Three renal biopsies were performed and showed mesangial IgA deposits without any extracapillary proliferation. Median C-reactive protein was 180 (range 15.1-225) mg/L, median serum creatinine level was 65 (range 41-169) µmol/L, and 2 patients had a glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min. Four patients received first-line treatment with glucocorticoids. All patients had a favorable progression and 2 patients experienced minor skin relapses, one after COVID-19 vaccination.  Conclusion:   This series describes the emergence of IgAV closely following COVID-19; we were not able to eliminate an incidental link between these events. Their disease outcomes were favorable.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed seventy women diagnosed with bladder neck obstruction by video-urodynamic study (VUDS). TUBNI was performed for each patient, with incisions made at 2 different sites on the bladder neck. Postoperatively, patients were assessed by international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) and uroflowmetry.  Results:   Follow-up data were available for 4-108 months (median 42 months) postoperatively. During follow-up, the IPSS, QOL, time to maximum uroflow rate, postvoid residual urine volume decreased significantly after TUBNI compared with preoperative [13.0 (10.0, 15.0) versus 3.0 (3.0, 8.0), P ＜ .001], [5.0 (5.0, 5.0) versus 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P ＜ .001], [9.0 (5.0, 37.0) versus 6.1 (4.2, 8.7), P ＜ .001], [77.5 (23.5, 165.8) versus 0.0 (0.0, 30.0), P ＜ .001].

However, post-liver resection recurrence rates remain high. This study aimed to determine whether liver stiffness measurement (LSM) correlated with recurrence and to propose a method for predicting HCC recurrence exclusively using pre-liver resection criteria.  Methods:   This retrospective monocentric study included patients who had undergone LR liver resection for HCC between 2015 and 2018 and who had (1) preoperative alpha-fetoprotein scores indicating initial transplant viability and (2) available preoperative LSM data. We developed a predictive score for recurrence over time using Cox univariate regression and multivariate analysis with a combination plot before selecting the optimal thresholds (receiver operating characteristic curves + Youden test).  Results:   Sixty-six patients were included. After an average follow-up of 40 months, the recurrence rate was 45% (n = 30). Three-year overall survival was 88%. Four preoperative variables significantly impacted the time to recurrence: age ≥70 years, LSM ≥11 kPa, international normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.2, and maximum HCC diameter ≥3 cm. By assigning 1 point per positive item, patients with a score <2 (n = 22) demonstrated greater mean overall survival (69.7 vs 54.8 months, P = .02) and disease-free survival (52.2 vs 34.7 months, P = .02) than those with a score ≥2. Patients experiencing early recurrence (<1 year) presented a significantly higher preoperative LSM (P = .06).

Limited large contemporary data sets are available allowing comparison of clinicopathologic features between ILC and invasive ductal cancer (IDC).  Methods:   The Great Lakes Breast Cancer Consortium was formed to compare clinical behavior of ILC (n = 3617) and IDC (n = 30 045) from 33 662 patients treated between 1990 and 2017 at 3 large clinical centers. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and propensity score matching to evaluate treatment differences and outcomes. All statistical testing used 2-sided P values.  Results:   Compared with IDC, patients with ILC were more frequently diagnosed at later stages and with more lymph node involvement (corrected P < .001). Estrogen receptor-positive ILCs were of lower grade (grade 1 and 2: 90% in ILC vs 72% in IDC) but larger in size (T3 and 4: 14.3% in ILC vs 3.4% in IDC) (corrected P < .001), and since 1990, the mean ILC size detected at diagnosis increased yearly. Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive ILC underwent statistically significantly more mastectomies compared with ER-positive IDC (57% vs 46%). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with ER-positive ILC had statistically significantly worse disease-free survival and overall survival than ER-positive IDC although 6 times more IDCs were classified as high risk by OncotypeDx Breast Recurrence Score assay.

The first was a multi-isocentric (MI) volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach (HEART_MI) with one isocenter located within the tumor and the second chosen up to 10 cm away longitudinally. The second was a noncoplanar (NCP) VMAT approach (HEART_NCP) utilizing up to three large couch angles and a standard arc at couch 0. The final planning strategy took a mixed approach (HEART_HYBRID) utilizing the HEART_NCP strategy for two thirds of the treatment combined with a plan utilizing a pair of opposite-opposed gantry angles for the remaining treatments. Investigational plans were compared to original plans using dose-volume histogram metrics such as organ volume receiving greater than x Gy (Vx) or mean dose (Dmean).  Results:   Although there was a small but statistically significant decrease in internal target volume coverage for HEART_MI plans and, conversely, a statistically significant increase for HEART_NCP plans, all generated plans met physician-prescribed target constraints. For heart dose, there were statistically significant decreases in all heart metrics and particularly MHD for the HEART_MI (9.8 vs. 15.4 Gy [p < 0.001], respectively), HEART_NCP (9.2 vs. 15.4 Gy [p < 0.001]), respectively), and HEART_HYBRID (7.9 vs. 15.4 Gy [p < 0.001], respectively) strategies.  Conclusions:   The strategy providing the best compromise between plan quality and cardiac dose reduction was HEART_NCP, which produced MHD reductions of 37.6% ± 12.9% (6.2 ± 3.4 Gy) relative to original plans. This strategy could potentially reduce adverse cardiac events, leading to improved quality of life for these patients.""","""['Joshua P Kim', 'Jake Dewalt', 'Aharon Feldman', 'Khaled Adil', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[' Department of Radiation Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Fully automated VMAT treatment planning for advanced-stage NSCLC patients.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy for the treatment of a large planning target volume in thoracic esophageal cancer.', 'Regression models for predicting physical and EQD2 plan parameters of two methods of hybrid planning for stage III NSCLC.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment planning of thoracic vertebral metastases using stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Cardiac-sparing radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

However, clinicians have had limited opportunities to evaluate these new therapies. One of the new drugs, apremilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor), was approved in 2017 in Japan. We previously reported oral treatment for psoriasis before the introduction of apremilast. In this study, we investigated the impact of apremilast on oral medication for psoriasis by comparing data obtained before and after apremilast became available. This retrospective study enrolled patients who visited the Department of Dermatology, Fukuoka University Hospital, who were diagnosed with psoriasis and treated with anti-psoriatic oral medications. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, who first visited our clinic between January 2010 and March 2016; and Group 2, who first visited our clinic between April 2016 and March 2022. The information collected included patient demographics, drug use (apremilast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and etretinate), and treatment duration. In Group 1 (n = 149 patients), cyclosporine, methotrexate, and etretinate were prescribed to 59.1%, 16.6%, and 24.3% of the patients, respectively. In Group 2 (n = 129 patients), apremilast was prescribed to 52.5% of patients, while the number of prescriptions for cyclosporine and etretinate had decreased to 17.1% and 8.3%, respectively. The number of methotrexate prescriptions did not change significantly. Apremilast, methotrexate, and etretinate had longer continuation rates than cyclosporine in Group 2. In conclusion, apremilast replaced cyclosporine and etretinate mainly because of its better safety profile, whereas methotrexate remained in constant demand in both eras. New oral treatments for psoriasis, such as tyrosine kinase-2 inhibitors, are now in the pipeline, and our data will serve as a control for oral anti-psoriatic medicine before the coming era.""","""['Sayaka Takano-Kawasaki', 'Emi Sato', 'Kazuki Yamaguchi', 'Shinichi Imafuku']""","""[' Department of Dermatology, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', ' Department of Dermatology, Saiseikai Futsukaichi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""J Dermatol""","""['Real-world use of apremilast for patients with psoriasis in Japan.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Comparative efficacy and incremental cost per responder of methotrexate versus apremilast for methotrexate-naïve patients with psoriasis.', 'Drug survival of apremilast in a real-world setting.', 'Low-dose short-term cyclosporine versus etretinate in psoriasis: improvement of skin, nail, and joint involvement.']"""

Herein, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy in 934 Japanese patients with BCC and statistically analyze the clinicopathological factors affecting diagnostic accuracy. We analyzed 5093 skin lesions, including 934 BCCs that were diagnosed consecutively from 1998 to 2018. The sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopic diagnosis for BCC were calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopic diagnosis were 92.2% and 96.0%, respectively. There were 73 false-negative cases of BCCs that were clinically diagnosed with other diseases. The most common incorrect clinical diagnosis was seborrheic keratosis (n = 18), followed by melanocytic nevus (n = 15). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that sensitivity was significantly lower in BCCs located on the trunk and extremities, which showed low pigmentation (less than 10% of the lesion surface) and were diagnosed by a resident dermatologist. Experience of 3-6 months of 12 resident dermatologists revealed increased sensitivity. Dermoscopy is a reliable tool for the accurate diagnosis of BCC in Japanese individuals. Care should be taken when diagnosing BCCs of the trunk and extremities, and the less-pigmented subtype because of lower sensitivity.

Medical records of patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures were reviewed. Plain radiographs were obtained during the follow-up period, and the hospital for special surgery (HSS) score was used to assess the function of the injured limb. Perioperative complications were recorded and followed-up. In total, 32 patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures were treated using a modified posterolateral approach. The mean age of the patients was 44 ± 11 years (28-64 years). All patients successfully underwent surgery and were followed-up for a mean duration of 13 ± 2 months (10-16 months). On plain radiographs, fracture lines were fuzzy 3 months after surgery and disappeared 12 months after surgery. No perioperative complications occurred during the follow-up period. The HSS score was evaluated 12 months after surgery, and the mean score was 91 ± 5 points (81-97 points), including 25 excellent cases and 7 good cases. The modified posterolateral inverted L-shaped approach has the advantages of small soft tissue dissection, fracture reduction under direct vision, easy internal fixation, and a lower risk of neurovascular injury.

We examined 10,901 patients who underwent prostate biopsy from May 2003 to December 2017 retrospectively. Among them, 10,325 patients underwent 12-core TRUS-PB and 576 patients underwent MRI-TRUS FTPB. The clinicopathological features and complications in both groups were compared. After propensity score matching, there were no significant differences in the clinical features and complication rates between both groups (P > .05). In the multivariate analyses, the prostate volume was shown to be the only significant predictor of overall complications, infectious complications, bleeding related complications, and Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 2 complications after prostate biopsy (P < .001). The present study demonstrates the safety of MRI-TRUS FTPB in terms of complications, compared with that of TRUS-PB. Although the combination of MRI-TRUS FTPB and 12-core TRUS-PB provides enhanced diagnostic power, MRI-TRUS FGB alone could provide a reasonable diagnostic value for prostate cancer if the apparent diffusion coefficient suspicious grade of prostate cancer is ≥4. When the Likert suspicious grade of prostate cancer on the apparent diffusion coefficient map of multiparametric MRI was 3, 13.9% (27/194) of the patients were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa); 44.4% (12/27) of them were confirmed as csPCa at the MRI-targeted cores. When the apparent diffusion coefficient suspicious grade was ≥4, 43.0% (108/251) were diagnosed with csPCa; 76.8% (83/108) of them were confirmed to have csPCa at the MRI-targeted cores.""","""['Byeongdo Song', 'Sung Il Hwang', 'Hak Jong Lee', 'Seong Jin Jeong', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sangchul Lee']""","""[' Department of Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['A Randomized Controlled Trial To Assess and Compare the Outcomes of Two-core Prostate Biopsy Guided by Fused Magnetic Resonance and Transrectal Ultrasound Images and Traditional 12-core Systematic Biopsy.', 'Comparison of complications rates between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion and systematic TRUS prostatic biopsies.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Guided Prostate Biopsy in Patients with\u2009≥\u2009One Negative Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of all histopathology proven cases of LV, BDL, and LMS with a preoperative MRI was performed. Twenty-seven cases were included (five LMS, three LV, and 19 BDL) with each case independently read by a pair of radiologists. Lesion size, margins, presence or absence of degeneration, necrosis, and haemorrhage were assessed on MRI along with quantitative factors such as mean T2-weighted (W) and T1W signal intensity, T1W signal heterogeneity, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios as well as dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) characteristics along with the presence or absence of lymphadenopathy and extra-uterine and peritoneal spread.

Methods:   Patients who received bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, or sotrovimab for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center from 5/1/2020 to 3/1/2022 were identified retrospectively. Patient data including demographics, adverse events, and outcomes were extracted from patients' charts and summarized by standard descriptive summaries.  Results:   Ninety-four patients received monoclonal antibody therapy, of which 14 (14.9%) received either bamlanivimab or bamlanivimab-etesevimab, 54 (57.4%) received casirivimab-imdevimab, and 26 (27.6%) received sotrovimab. Ten patients (10.6%) experienced one or more infusion-related adverse event. Of the patients who experienced adverse events, all resolved with cessation of infusion. No life-threatening events or deaths occurred. Within 90 days of receiving a monoclonal antibody, 12 patients (12.7%) required additional medical care for ongoing COVID symptoms. Five of these were either hospitalized or received escalation of care while already in the hospital. All subsequently fully recovered.

Due to the multitude of underlying factors, prediction of outcomes remains poor. We aimed to identify factors governing diagnosis and survival in AMI and develop novel prognostic tools.  Methods:   This monocentric retrospective study analyzed patients with suspected AMI undergoing imaging between January 2014 and December 2019. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with confirmed AMI undergoing surgery. Nomograms were calculated based on multivariable logistic regression models.  Results:   Five hundred and thirty-nine patients underwent imaging for clinically suspected AMI, with 216 examinations showing radiological indication of AMI. Intestinal necrosis (IN) was confirmed in 125 undergoing surgery, 58 of which survived and 67 died (median 9 days after diagnosis, IQR 22). Increasing age, ASA score, pneumatosis intestinalis, and dilated bowel loops were significantly associated with presence of IN upon radiological suspicion. In contrast, decreased pH, elevated creatinine, radiological atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion (versus non-occlusive AMI), and colonic affection (compared to small bowel ischemia only) were associated with impaired survival in patients undergoing surgery. Based on the identified factors, we developed two nomograms to aid in prediction of IN upon radiological suspicion (C-Index = 0.726) and survival in patients undergoing surgery for IN (C-Index = 0.791).  Conclusion:   As AMI remains a condition with high mortality, we identified factors predicting occurrence of IN with suspected AMI and survival when undergoing surgery for IN.

Methods:   A retrospective study of six patients with LS-SCLC who were treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (durvalumab plus etoposide combined with cisplatin) was performed. Patients were evaluated by the safety, feasibility and pathologic responses of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.  Results:   Neoadjuvant durvalumab combined chemotherapy was associated with few immediate adverse events and did not delay planned surgery. All patients achieved partial pathologic response (pPR) instead of major pathologic response, or pathologic complete response. No association was observed between programmed death-ligand 1 expression in tumor specimens and the pathologic response. However, tumors with high expression of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and FoxP3+ Tregs tended to have better pathologic responses than tumors with low expression of immune cells.

Evidence-based treatment recommendations are scarce. The primary study outcome was to examine whether surgical treatment in patients with epiphrenic diverticula leads to improved quality of life by outweighing the perioperative risks compared with conservative treatment.  Methods:   All patients with an epiphrenic diverticula at our institution between 2001 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed and followed-up using a specific questionnaire, including the Eating Assessment Tool, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index quality-of-life scores.  Results:   Of 51 patients with epiphrenic diverticula, 28 had surgery and 23 had conservative treatment. The most common symptom at presentation was dysphagia. Although 16 patients underwent open surgery, 12 had minimally invasive procedures. A prophylactic stent was applied intraoperatively in 6 patients. The morbidity rate in surgically treated patients was 50% (14/28), with a leakage in 43% (12/28; 33% for prophylactic stenting). Mortality was nil. At a median follow-up of 139 months, patients with surgery had better outcomes than those without (ie, less dysphagia [6/12 vs 11/12; P = .025]), a less likely pathologic Eating Assessment Tool score (4/12 vs 9/12; P = .041), and a nonsignificant better Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score (122 vs 112; P = .929). The rate of recurrence/progression of symptoms was significantly higher for conservatively treated patients (11/18 vs 6/27 for any surgery; P = .008), as well as for patients with minimally invasive procedure (5/12 vs 1/15 for open surgery; P = .030).  Conclusion:   Despite the high perioperative morbidity, surgical treatment of epiphrenic diverticula leads to an improved long-term quality of life and lower recurrence rates than conservative treatment.""","""['Ulrich Nitsche', 'Marie Seitz', 'Helmut Friess', 'Hubertus Feussner', 'Norbert Hüser', 'Alissa Jell']""","""[' Department of Surgery, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.

So, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of nasal septal deviation (NSD), nasal septal spur (NSS) and nasal septal pneumatization (NSP) among the Saudi adult population and their links with the incidence of sinusitis by using computed tomography (CT). A retrospective study was achieved over a twenty-two months period on 681 adult Saudi subjects (420 males and 261 females) aged 20 years or older, referred for coronal CT evaluation of the paranasal sinuses. NSD and NSS were significantly more prevalent in males than females (80.0% vs. 67.4% respectively for NSD, and 34.5% vs. 24.9% respectively for NSS), while there was no statistical difference in frequency of NSP regarding gender (P=0.670). The incidence of sinusitis was significantly higher in presence of NSD and/or NSS (P<0.001 for both). On the contrary, NSP was not associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of sinusitis (P=0.131). In conclusion, NSD and NSS are more prevalent in males than females among the Saudi population with no statistical difference between both genders regarding the presence of septal pneumatization.

Materials and methods:   One hundred and ninety-eight consecutive patients with acute respiratory failure admitted for ECMO support between January 2015 and December 2019 who underwent whole-body CT performed within 48 h of ECMO initiation were examined in this single-institution retrospective study. CT findings were divided into three categories: clinically significant findings that may affect immediate management strategy or short-term outcomes; findings not related to hospital stay or outcome but require further workup; and benign findings that do not require further investigation. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of CT findings with 7- and 30-day survival.  Results:   Clinically significant findings were present in 147 (74%) patients, findings requiring further workup were found in 82 (41%) patients, and benign findings were identified in 180 (90%) of the patients.

All patients underwent routine abdominal unenhanced and three-phase enhanced CT examinations. The CT images were assessed by two experienced radiologists by examining location, number, size, septa, texture, gas in the pus cavity, portal phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, and abnormal perfusion during the arterial phase. Statistical differences for continuous characteristics were analysed with independent samples t-test or Wilcoxon's test, while the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent related factors of invasive KPLA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for assessment.  Results:   Age and type 2 diabetes were significantly different between the patients with invasive and non-invasive KPLA. In addition, patients with invasive KPLA had lower levels of platelet and total protein (p<0.05) and higher total bilirubin compared to patients with non-invasive KPLA.

Methods:   We enrolled patients with ESD for EGC at 33 institutions between 2013 and 2016. In study 1, we evaluated bleeding risk following ESD in surgically altered stomach, compared with whole stomach. In study 2, we evaluated factors associated with bleeding following ESD in patients with surgically altered stomach.  Results:   Of 11,452 patients, 445 patients had surgically altered stomach with the bleeding rate following ESD of 4.9%. In study 1, the bleeding risk in surgically altered stomach was not significant (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-2.17) in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. No significant results were obtained when the surgically altered stomach was subdivided into various types.

Here, we explored its potential as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in patients with advanced NSCLC.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was undertaken.

The performance of ctDNA, cfDNA, and combining ctDNA with cfDNA were evaluated for their ability to predict survival outcomes.  Results:   Patients with early undetectable ctDNA and increasing cfDNA had a markedly better progression-free survival (PFS) (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.001) than those with early detectable ctDNA and decreasing cfDNA. Patients with early ctDNA clearance were more likely to have the ctDNA persistent clearance (p = 0.006). The early clearance rate of ctDNA in the normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) group was significantly higher than in the low and high groups (p = 0.028). Patients with greater CEA decline had a higher early clearance rate of ctDNA than those with minor CEA change (p = 0.016).

Methods:   All consecutive patients with large (> 10 mm) postsurgical GL treated endoscopically with a combination of a CS and PDs were included in a single-center retrospective study. The primary endpoint was the rate of GL closure.  Results:   A total of 29 patients were included. Twenty-five patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy. The fistula (median diameter 15 mm) was diagnosed 6 days (IQR 4-9) after surgery. Technical success was observed in all procedures. After a median follow-up of 10.7 months (IQR 3.8-20.7), GL closure was observed in 82.7% with a median time of 63 days (IQR 40-90). Surgical management was finally necessary in four patients after a median of 186 days (IQR 122-250). No complications related to combined endoscopic treatment were observed especially stent migration during the follow-up.  Conclusion:   An endoscopic strategy combining CS crossing through PDs appears to be effective, safe and well tolerated for the treatment of large GL.""","""['Clara Yzet', 'Sami Hakim', 'Mathieu Pioche', 'Jean-Phillippe Le Mouel', 'Constance Deschepper', 'Pierre Lafeuille', 'Richard Delcenserie', 'Thierry Yzet', 'Eric Nguyen-Khac', 'Mathurin Fumery', 'Franck Brazier']""","""[' Gastroenterology Unit, Amiens University Hospital, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France. yzet.clara@chu-amiens.fr.', ' Gastroenterology Unit, Amiens University Hospital, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.', ' Gastroenterology Unit, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.', ' Radiology Unit, Amiens University Hospital, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Correction: Endoscopic treatment of large gastric leaks after gastrectomy using the combination of double pigtail drains crossing a covered stent.', 'New endoscopic technique for the treatment of large gastric fistula or gastric stenosis associated with gastric leaks after sleeve gastrectomy.', 'Endoscopic internal drainage for the management of leak, fistula, and collection after sleeve gastrectomy: our experience in 617 consecutive patients.', 'Endoscopic internal drainage by double pigtail stents in the management of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy leaks.', 'Treating sleeve gastrectomy leak with endoscopic stenting: the Kuwaiti experience and review of recent literature.', 'Is there a place for pigtail drains in the management of gastric leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?']"""

The aim of this study was to develop a tool to predict nodal disease in patients with small (≤2 cm) nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  Methods:   A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients undergoing resection for small nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with genetic syndromes, metastatic disease at diagnosis, neoadjuvant therapy, or positive resection margin were excluded. Factors associated with nodal disease were identified to develop a predictive model. Internal validation was performed using bootstrap with 1,000 resamples.  Results:   Nodal disease was observed in 39 (11.1%) of the 353 patients included. Presence of nodal disease was significantly associated with lower 5-year disease-free survival (71.6% vs 96.2%, P < .001). Two predictors were strongly associated with nodal disease: G2 grade (odds ratio: 3.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-7.22, P = .001) and tumor size (per mm increase, odds ratio: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.25, P = .009). Adequate discrimination was observed with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.80). Based on risk distribution, 3 risk groups of nodal disease were identified; low (<5%), intermediate (≥5% to <20%), and high (≥20%) risk. The observed mean risk of nodal disease was 3.7% in the low-risk patients, 9.6% in the intermediate-risk patients, and 30.4% in the high-risk patients (P < .001). The 10-year disease-free survival in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups was 100%, 88.8%, and 50.1%, respectively.

Redefined diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate Cowden Syndrome. Imaging indicators were analysed retrospectively to extract typical and atypical features. Imaging findings and preoperative diagnostic accuracy were compared between the subgroups.  Results:   None of these patients met the redefined diagnostic criteria. The typical ""tiger stripe sign"" was seen in most LDD lesions (13/29, 61.9%), with lower density (29.66 ± 2.51 versus 37.81 ± 2.76 HU, p<0.001) and higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (1.04 ± 0.05 × 10-3 versus 0.74 ± 0.03 × 10-3 mm2/s, p<0.001) than that of the normal cerebellum.

Self-efficacy for managing pain plays a protective role against pain chronicity. For chronic pain sufferers, social support from caregivers is important. However, such caregivers face enormous physical and mental burdens. This study aimed to assess how self-efficacy and factors related to the fear-avoidance model affect caregiver burden. Participants were 135 chronic pain patients and their caregivers who visited our outpatient pain special clinic. In clinical assessments, numeric rating scale (NRS), pain catastrophizing scale (PCS), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), pain disability assessment scale (PDAS), pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ) for the patients and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) for their caregivers were evaluated. Participants were divided into 2 groups (L group ZBI < 24 points and H group ZBI ≥ 24 points) and compared. Regression analyses were conducted to identify factors correlated with the ZBI scores. Compared to L group, H group showed significantly higher NRS and HADs depression scores, and lower PSEQ scores. In univariate regression analysis, ZBI scores were significantly correlated with NRS, PCS, HADS anxiety, HADS depression, PDAS and PSEQ. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ZBI scores were significantly correlated with PSEQ. The caregivers who perceived high caregiver burden had significantly higher patients' pain intensity, depression, and lower self-efficacy than those who perceived low caregiver burden. Caregiver burden correlated with the pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, disability, and self-efficacy of chronic pain patients. Among these factors, self-efficacy was the most negatively correlated with caregiver burden.

Aberrant CD8+ T cell infiltration plays a critical role in tumor progression and patient prognosis. This study aimed to identify a prognostic model for CRC based on CD8+ T cell-related genes. The infiltration levels of immune cells in CRC tissues were accessed by the ESTIMATE algorithm. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis was used to select CD8+ T cell-related genes. Prognostic genes were identified using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to construct prognostic models. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to annotate enriched gene sets. Single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis was used to examine gene expression in different cell types. We found that the downregulated infiltration level of CD8+ T cells was an independent prognostic factor for CRC and selected a cluster of differentially expressed genes correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration (CD8TDEGs). Subsequently, we identified 18 prognostic CD8TDEGs, according to which patients were reclassified into two clusters with distinct overall survival. Seven prognostic CD8TDEGs were selected to calculate the constructed prognostic model's risk scores. Interestingly, although CRC tissues with higher risk scores had higher infiltration levels of CD8+ T cells, the level of immune checkpoint genes was also high. Moreover, the scRNA-sequencing analysis showed that the expression levels of CD8TDEGs in the prognostic model varied among different types of cells.

To further evaluate the efficacy of this reduction technique, and elucidate its mechanism, we compared it with the control groups in this study. Between March 2017 and November 2020, 52 patients were included in this retrospective comparative study. 20 patients were included in the S-S group (Steinmann pin retractor with internal fixation via the sinus tarsi approach), 17 patients were included in the S group (internal fixation via sinus tarsi approach), and 15 patients were included in the L group (internal fixation via L-shaped approach). Patients in each group were operated on by a distinctly skilled surgeon who is specialized in one of the specified surgeries mentioned above. All patients received positive postoperative radiological and clinical evaluations. The patients were followed up for at least 6 months postoperatively. At the last S-S group follow-up, the VAS value (0.29 ± 0.46) improved compared to the L group.

Methods:   Patients undergoing pancreatic resections for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms between 2001 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed based on a prospective database. Clinicopathological parameters and perioperative outcome were assessed. Overall and disease-free survival was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed for sporadic, nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms without distant metastases and ≥4 analyzed lymph nodes.  Results:   Of 605 surgically resected pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, 55% were G1, 36% were G2, and 9% were G3 differentiated. At the time of resection, 34% of patients had lymph node metastasis, and 16% had distant metastases. For subgroup analysis, 314 patients were analyzed. Lymph node metastases occurred in 36% of patients and were most frequent in G3 patients (67%). An increase in tumor size and advancement was associated with higher rates of lymph node metastasis, and disease-free survival was significantly impaired. Significant differences in disease-free survival were observed between 1 and 3 (5-year disease-free survival 52%) and ≥4 positive lymph nodes (5-year disease-free survival 28%), as well as when G3 tumors were excluded. In multivariable analysis, grading, tumor stage, and especially lymph node metastases as well as the proposed pN1 and pN2 categories were confirmed as independent predictors of recurrence.

This study aimed to explore the association between thyroid hormones and the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in patients without intracranial arterial stenosis, which is a common manifestation in the brain.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 304 patients at the Department of Neurology in Nantong First People's Hospital between June 2018 and June 2020. Thyroid hormone levels and other laboratory data were collected on the day after admission. The patients were divided into two WMH burden groups based on Fazekas scores as follows: ''mild-moderate group'' and ''severe group.'  ' results:   The severe WMH group had higher ages (P=0.000), higher serum concentration of fibrinogen (P=0.040), higher concentration of creatinine (P=0.040), lower concentration of low-density lipoprotein (P=0.013), and higher concentration of free thyroxine (FT4) (P=0.003). The prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) increased with increasing quartiles (P=0.023). Multivariable logistic regression and ordinal regression analysis showed that higher concentrations of FT4, age, and CMBs were also independent risk factors for severe WMH. The concentrations of FT4 were grouped according quartiles. The results showed that the prevalence of severe WMH increased with higher quartiles. This correlation persisted after adjusting for risk factors such as sex, age, history of hypertension, diabetes, drinking history, and smoking history.  Conclusion:   Our results support the hypothesis that FT4 is associated with the severity of WMH in patients without intracranial arterial stenosis. In addition, age and CMBs are independently related to the severity of WMH.""","""['Can Xing', 'Wei Chen', 'Dan Li', 'Yan Li', 'Xiangyang Zhu']""","""[' Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Sep""","""Neuro Endocrinol Lett""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Volume of White Matter Hyperintensities, and Cerebral Micro-Bleeds.', 'Association of cerebral white matter hyperintensities with coronary artery calcium in a healthy population: a cross-sectional study.', 'Relationship between cerebral microbleeds and white matter MR hyperintensities in systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective observational study.', 'Cerebral microbleeds are associated with deep white matter hyperintensities, but only in hypertensive patients.']"""

Material and methods:   Thirty-five patients with hypogonadism who were diagnosed with prolactinoma were recruited to this retrospective study. Age, hemoglobin, hematocrit, glucose, lipid parameters, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, and the adenoma size were compared at the baseline and 6th month of the treatment. The parameters were also compared between the patients with hypogonadism (n=8) and the patients without hypogonadism at the 6th month of the treatment (n=27). Correlation analysis was also performed in terms of parameters that may be associated with the testosterone levels at the 6th month of the treatment.  Results:   The mean current age of the whole study group was 45.6±13.0 years, and the mean adenoma size was 23.9±11.4 mm. Thirty patients had macroadenoma, and five patients had microadenoma. Eight patients (23%) had low testosterone levels and hypogonadism symptoms at the 6th month of the prolactinoma treatment. The adenoma size was larger in patients with persistent hypogonadism than the patients without hypogonadism at the 6th month of the treatment, while the prolactin levels were similar between the groups, and macroadenoma was detected in all patients with persistent hypogonadism. A negative correlation was found between the testosterone levels at the 6th month of the prolactinoma treatment with the adenoma size.

Methods:   This study was designed as a retrospective case series using the database of the National Center for Global Medicine covering the period from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. We enrolled pediatric patients aged 15 years or younger with crystalluria attributable to TFLX treated in our pediatric department and collected clinical data.  Results:   Thirteen patients were diagnosed with crystalluria attributable to TFLX. The median age of the patients at diagnosis was 4.0 years (range, 0.8-15 years; interquartile range = 1.2-8.8 years), and five patients (38%) were male. Six patients (46%) had gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain, and 12 patients (92%) had decreased oral intake. The median time to diagnosis after TFLX administration was 4 days (range, 2-7 days; interquartile range = 3-6 days). All patients received TFLX at the appropriate dose. Two patients (17%) were diagnosed with acute kidney injury, and both had gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain.

Methods:   Thirty esophageal cancer patients received 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging pre-RT and post-RT were included in a retrospective pilot study. We fused lung doses and parameters of PET/CT in RT planning. Based on VBA, we used the 5Gy isodose curve to define high-dose (HD) and low-dose (LD) regions in the lung volume. We divided patients into non-RP (nRP) and RP groups. The maximum, mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean), global lung glycolysis (GLG), mean lung dose (MLD) and V5-30 in lungs were analyzed. Area under the curve values were utilized to identify optimal cut-off values for RP.  Results:   Eleven patients in the nRP group and 19 patients in the RP group were identified.

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is widely used to rescue these patients; however, its efficacy and safety in this critical population have not been well defined. We report our experience of using ECLS for the treatment of severely burned patients with concurrent inhalation injury and ARDS.  Methods:   This was a retrospective analysis of 14 patients collected from a single medical burn center from 2012 to 2019. All patients suffered from major burns with inhalation injury and ARDS, and were treated with ECLS.  Results:   The median total body surface area of deep dermal or full thickness burns was 94.5%, ranging 47.7-99.0 %. The median revised Baux score was 122.0, ranging 90.0-155.0. All patients developed ARDS with a median partial pressure of arterial oxygen to a fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 61.5, ranging 49.0-99.0. Indications for ECLS included sustained hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamics. The median interval for initiating ECLS was 2.5 days, ranging 1.0-156.0 days. The median duration of ECLS was 2.9 days, ranging 0.3-16.7 days. The overall survival to discharge was 42.8%. Causes of death included sepsis and multiple organ failure. ECLS-related complications included cannulation bleeding, catheter-related infection, and hemolysis. The incidence of risk factors reported in literature were higher in non-survivors, including Baux>120, albumin < 3.0 g/dL, and lactate > 8 mmol/L.  Conclusions:   For severely burned patients with concurrent inhalation injury and ARDS, ECLS could be a salvage treatment to improve sustained hypoxemia.

Carpal tunnel release (CTR) in one wrist may relieve the symptoms of the contralateral wrist, avoiding the need for second surgery; conversely, the symptoms may persist or worsen, requiring contralateral surgery in some cases. The present study investigated whether surgical treatment was finally required for the non-operated CTS wrist, and in what cases non-operative treatment was possible. We compared baseline characteristics, risk factors and electrodiagnostic data between CTS patients who underwent only unilateral CTR and those who subsequently underwent bilateral surgery at various time intervals. This single-center retrospective study included 188 patients with bilateral CTS managed between 2010 and 2020; 137 patients (group 1, 73%) underwent only unilateral CTR, and 51 (group 2, 27%) subsequently underwent contralateral CTR. In group 1, contralateral CTS symptoms were assessed in 4 categories and compared to the presenting symptoms in the index wrist. There were no significant differences in age, gender, preoperative symptom duration, body status, addictive behavior, electrodiagnostic study or comorbidities, other than a higher rate of dialysis in group 2. The contralateral wrist showed partial or complete symptom relief in 57% of patients undergoing unilateral CTR. High BMI and history of diabetes were risk factors for persistent severe CTS or subsequent contralateral CTR.""","""['Jun-Ku Lee', 'Byung-Nam Yoon', 'Dong Won Kim', 'Han-Seung Ryu', 'Inseok Jang', 'Hyunkyo Kim', 'Soo-Hong Han']""","""[' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, 100, Ilsan-ro, Ilsandong-gu, Goyang-si, 10444 Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.

Using retrospective data from an overarching experimental study, we examined depressive symptoms and their relationship to demographic and language characteristics in people with chronic aphasia. As a secondary objective, we compared prevalence of depressive symptoms among the overarching study's included and excluded participants.  Methods:   We examined retrospective data from 121 individuals with chronic aphasia including depression scale scores, demographic information (sex, age, time post onset of stroke, education, race/ethnicity, and Veteran status), and scores on assessments of general and modality-specific language impairments.  Results:   Approximately 50% of participants reported symptoms indicative of depressive disorders: 23% indicative of major depression and 27% indicative of mild depression. Sex (males) and comparatively younger age emerged as statistically significant variables associated with depressive symptoms; naming ability was minimally associated with depressive symptoms. Time post onset of stroke, education level, race/ethnicity, Veteran status, and aphasia severity were not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Depression-scale scores were significantly higher for individuals excluded from the overarching study compared to those who were included.  Conclusions:   The rate of depressive disorders in this sample was higher than rates of depression reported in the general stroke literature. Participant sex, age, and naming ability emerged as factors associated with depressive symptoms, though these links appear complex, especially given variable reports from prior research. Importantly, depressive symptoms do not appear to diminish over time for individuals with chronic aphasia. Given these results and the relatively limited documentation of depression in aphasia literature, depression remains a pressing concern for aphasia research and routine clinical care.""","""['R Hunting Pompon', 'W Fassbinder', 'M R McNeil', 'H Yoo', 'H S Kim', 'R M Zimmerman', 'N Martin', 'J P Patterson', 'S R Pratt', 'M W Dickey']""","""[' University of Delaware, Newark, DE.

In this study, the 1-year probability of a major limb complication was compared between external and internal fixation of severe open tibial fractures.  Methods:   This multicenter randomized clinical trial included patients 18 to 64 years of age with severe open tibial shaft fractures randomly assigned to either modern external ring fixation (n = 127) or internal fixation (n = 133). The primary outcome was a major limb complication within 365 days after randomization; these complications included amputation, infection, a soft-tissue problem, nonunion, malunion, and a loss of reduction/implant failure.  Results:   Of 260 randomized patients, 254 were included in the final analysis. Their mean age (standard deviation) was 39 (13) years; 214 (84%) were men. The probability of at least 1 major limb complication was higher for external fixation (62.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 53.4% to 70.8%]) than internal fixation (43.7% [95% CI: 35.5% to 52.9%]), with a risk difference of 18.4% (95% CI: 5.8% to 30.4%); p = 0.005). The most notable difference was in loss of reduction/implant failure, the rate of which was higher for external fixation (risk difference: 14.4% [95% CI: 7.0% to 21.6%]; p = 0.002). There was no appreciable difference in the probability of deep infection between external fixation (26.1%) and internal fixation (29.7%) (risk difference: -3.5% [95% CI: -14.8% to 7.8%]; p = 0.54). There were also no appreciable differences in the probabilities of amputation, nonunion, soft-tissue problems, malunion, or fracture healing between the groups.

Methods:   Between February 2020 and March 2022, consecutive patients with a previous R-Y gastrectomy requiring ERCP were prospectively enrolled. Different mechanistic loop resolution strategies for two-dimensional loops, three-dimensionally rotated loops, and loops making a cane or S-shape were applied during the SBE approach.  Results:   Forty-three short SBE-ERCP procedures were performed on 37 patients, with an approach success rate of 100.0% (43/43). The mean time to reach the jejunojejunal anastomosis and target site were 8.0 (6.0-11.0) minutes and 26.0 (16.0-36.0) minutes, respectively. The major challenges for the approach were the cane or S-shaped loop in the jejunojejunal anastomosis or Treitz ligament. The retroflex positioning of a SBE in front of the papilla was achieved in 86.0% (37/43), and the cannulation success rate in patients with an intact papilla was 90.9% (30/33). The initial, overall therapeutic successes, median total procedure time, and adverse event rate were 87.8%, 92.7%, 77.0 (IQR 56-100.5) minutes, and 11.6%, respectively.

Methods:   Eighty-six patients underwent mitral valve repair with RA for FMR. Thirty-five of them received additional bilateral papillary muscle relocation for severe leaflet tethering. The papillary muscles were relocated posteriorly (PMR-P) early in the study. Then, in the later period, the technique was modified to PMR-A, in which the papillary muscles were relocated anteriorly for 24 cases. The survival of the patients undergoing RA + PMR-A was examined retrospectively, adjusting for differences in patient background.  Results:   Twenty-three deaths were observed during the follow-up period out of the 86 cases. Independent preoperative risk factors for survival were left ventricular ejection fraction, patient age and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.

Risk factors for non-lung cancer deaths (NLCD) were analysed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The overall survival (OS) of patients with low and high comorbidities who underwent lobectomy and segmentectomy was compared using a log-rank test.  Results:   Patients with NLCD (n = 126) were more likely to have undergone lobectomy than patients with non-recurrence survival (n = 1259). Multivariable analysis revealed that age (≥65 years), smoking index (≥600), body mass index (≤18.5 kg/m2), interstitial pneumonia, values for percentage of predicted vital capacity (≤9.4%) and lobectomy were risk factors for NLCD. Patients who underwent segmentectomy had significantly better 5-year OS than those who underwent lobectomy, after propensity score matching (94.6% vs 90.4%, P = 0.027). Patients with high comorbidities (patients with ≥2 of the following risks: age ≥65 years, smoking index ≥600, body mass index ≤18.5 kg/m2, Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥1, values for percentage of predicted vital capacity ≤96.4%) who underwent segmentectomy had a better 5-year OS than those who underwent lobectomy (92.8% vs 87.8%, P = 0.016).

We examined the incidence of KRAS mutation variants with and without co-occurring PI3K or other genomic alterations and evaluated the association of these mutations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   One hundred twenty-six patients had genomic sequencing data; KRAS mutations were identified in 111 PDA and included the following variants: G12D (43)/G12V (35)/G12R (23)/other (10). PI3K pathway mutations (26% vs. 8%) and homologous recombination DNA repair (HRR) defects (35% vs. 12.5%) were more common among KRAS G12R vs. non-G12R mutated cancers.

Management of the unilateral subtype of primary aldosteronism with adrenalectomy requires multidisciplinary input. It is unclear if a dedicated endocrine hypertension service confers better outcomes compared to standard care offered by individual clinicians.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, patients from the Monash University Endocrine Surgery Database were divided into either the endocrine hypertension service group, where patients were managed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, or the standard group, where patients were managed by individual clinicians. The comparisons included patient selection for surgery, perioperative blood pressure control, and surgical cure rate.  Results:   Despite similar perioperative blood pressure, patients in the endocrine hypertension service group (n = 41) were on fewer antihypertensive medications (1 vs 2, P = .011) compared to the standard group (n = 55). A larger proportion of patients in the endocrine hypertension service group had either bilateral adrenal nodules or no adrenal lesions on computed tomography (41% vs 18%, P = .013). Patients in the standard group had larger adrenal lesions on computed tomography (median 15 mm vs 10 mm, P = .032). Postoperatively, the biochemical cure rate was higher in the endocrine hypertension service group at 6 to 12 months (97% vs 76%, P = .021).  Conclusion:   Patients managed by endocrine hypertension service were more likely to be diagnosed with surgically curable primary aldosteronism without a unilateral adrenal adenoma on imaging, required fewer medications for perioperative blood pressure control, and experienced superior postoperative outcomes.

This study aimed to define early recurrence and identify preoperative risk factors for early recurrence after upfront pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.  Methods:   This multicenter, retrospective study involved 500 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head at 10 institutions between 2007 and 2016. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinicopathological results were compared between early and non-early recurrence groups. Predictors of early recurrence were determined using statistical analyses.  Results:   Log-rank tests revealed a significant difference (P < .001) between recurrence within 3 to 6 months and 6 to 9 months. Early recurrence was subsequently defined as recurrence within 6 months. Patients were categorized into early recurrence (n = 104) and non-early recurrence groups (n = 389). The median overall survival of the early and non-early recurrence groups was 8.6 months and 42.6 months (P < .001), respectively. Preoperatively, high carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels ≥120 U/mL, retroperitoneal invasion, and diabetes mellitus were identified as independent predictive risk factors for early recurrence according to multivariate analysis. Comparing survival rates among patients with 3, 2, 1, or none of these factors, the median overall survival was 17.6 (n = 90), 21.2 (n = 184), 47 (n = 141), and 61.5 (n = 73) months, respectively.  Conclusion:   The optimal period that defines the early recurrence for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is 6 months.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence and distribution of iliac artery calcifications and correlate the novel pelvic calcification score (PCS) with cardiovascular risk factors and graft and overall survival in KT patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively included 118 KT patients operated at our institution with pretransplant pelvic CT. Calcification morphology, circumference and length of both common and external iliac arteries were independently scored by two uroradiologists. PCS was calculated as the total score sum of all three calcification features in all vessels. PCS correlation with graft and patient survival was performed.  Results:   Calcification in at least one vascular segment was found in 79% of patients. PCS was significantly higher in male patients (p = 0.006), patients over 55 years (p < 0.001), and patients on haemodialysis (p = 0.016). Patients with a PCS >3 had significantly shorter graft and overall survival rates (p = 0.041 and p = 0.039, respectively).  Conclusions:   The extent of iliac artery calcification in KT recipients quantified by PCS on pretransplant CT correlates with graft and overall patient survival. A PCS over three was associated with worse clinical outcomes and could become a possible prognostic factor.  Advances in knowledge:   Our novel PCS is a robust method for quantifying iliac artery calcification burden. Since higher a PCS correlates with worse patient and graft survival, PCS has the potential to become a prognostic factor in kidney transplant patients.""","""['Iva Žuža', 'Doris Dodig', 'Ivan Brumini', 'Dorian Tokmadžić', 'Lidija Orlić', 'David Zgrablić', 'Ivan Vukelić', 'Antun Gršković', 'Nataša Katalinić', 'Ante Jakšić', 'Damir Miletić', 'Sanjin Rački', 'Dean Markić']""","""[' Department of Radiology, University Hospital Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.', ' Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.', ' Department of Urology, University Hospital Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.']""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Application of a Novel CT-Based Iliac Artery Calcification Scoring System for Predicting Renal Transplant Outcomes.', 'The prognostic significance of iliac vessel calcification in renal transplantation.', 'Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.', 'Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.']"""

Whether left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-induced ventricular unloading can reverse EOV and may prevent short-term rehospitalization has not been investigated.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective single-center in- and outpatient analysis of patients with (n = 20, LVAD) and without (n = 27, HF) circulatory support and reduced ejection fraction (EF, 22.8 ± 7.9%). The association of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables and 3 months-rehospitalization (3MR) as a primary outcome was analyzed. Furthermore, CPET variables were compared regarding the presence of EOV (+/-).  Results:   Lower VO2peak (11.6 ± 4.9 ml/kg/min vs. 14.4 ± 4.3 ml/kg/min, p = 0.039), lower increase of PETCO2 (CI = 0.049-1.127; p = 0.068), and higher VE/VCO2 (43.8 ± 9.5 vs. 38.3 ± 10.6; p = 0.069) were associated with 3MR. Flattening of O2 pulse (CI = 0.139-2.379; p = 0.487) had no impact on 3MR. EOV was present in 59.5% (n = 28/47) of patients, without a significant difference between LVAD and HF patients (p = 0.959). Patients with HF/EOV+ demonstrated significantly lower VO2peak compared with HF/EOV- (p = 0.039). LVAD/EOV+ displayed significantly lower EF (p = 0.004) and fewer aortic valve opening than LVAD/EOV- (p = 0.027).  Conclusions:   Lower VO2peak , but not EOV, was associated with 3MR. EOV occurred at a similar rate in LVAD and HF patients, which may illustrate insufficient unloading during exercise in chronic LVAD therapy and may contribute to the limited exercise capacity following LVAD implantation.

In the U.S. most trauma transfers occur as emergency department (ED) to ED transfers, however there is little evidence to guide systems in whether this is beneficial. We implemented a practice change in August 2018, changing from commonly admitting trauma transfers directly to the floor, to a protocol for ED to ED transfer for all trauma patients. We aimed to evaluate this practice change and its effects on outcomes and ED length of stay.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all trauma transfers to our Level 1 trauma center between 8/1/2017-8/30/2020. Study groups were created based on the presence of a transfer protocol: a control group with no protocol, a selective ED pitstop protocol group and a systemwide ED pitstop protocol group. We compared patient and injury factors between groups, and evaluated each group's hospital mortality, unplanned ICU admission within 24 h, need for return to radiology for imaging, and ED length of stay.  Results:   1,987 patients were transferred during the study period. In our control group 37% of transfers were directly admitted. Implementing a selective ED pitstop decreased direct admissions to 17% and a systemwide ED pitstop decreased direct admissions to 10%. There was no difference in mortality between groups. Protocol implementation decreased unplanned ICU admissions from 2% to 1% in the selective protocol and 0.8% in the systemwide protocol, as well as decreasing the need for further diagnostic imaging (5% to 2.5% and 2%; in each group respectively).

Results:   A total of 60 patients were enrolled, of which 52 (86.6%) had lung cancer. In six (10%) patients, the panel results led to treatment with insurance-listed molecular-targeted agents; four patients had EGFR mutations not detected by the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and two had MET ex.14 skipping mutations.

Moreover, studies assessing the prognostic impact of PTC multifocality have yielded non-univocal results. We aimed to evaluate the following: a) the histopathological and clinical characteristics associated with multifocal PTC; and b) the impact of multifocality on the long-term outcome.  Material and methods:   We analysed a consecutive series of 2814 PTC patients without evidence of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (T1a, T1b, and T2), all of whom had undergone total thyroidectomy and were followed-up (median 4.7 years) in our thyroid clinic. Females comprised 81.3% and males 18.7% (F/M = 4.4/1), with a median age at diagnosis of 45.0 years. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups: 72.7% unifocal tumour and 27.3% multifocal tumour. Post-surgical radioiodine ablation (RAI) (30-100 mCi of 131-I) was performed in 1425 (50.6%) patients. All patients were periodically followed with thyroglobulin and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies measurements and with neck ultrasonography under L-thyroxine therapy and subjected to additional radioiodine administration or another therapeutic measure if not cured.  Results:   Patients in the multifocal group were older (median age 46.4 vs. 44.5 years, respectively, p < 0.05) and presented a lower F/M ratio (F/M = 3.7/1 and 4.7/1; p = 0.01). T1a and T1b tumours showed no significant difference in multifocality rate whereas T2 tumours were less frequently multifocal (14.2% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.05). Multifocal tumours were more frequent in N1b (11.3% vs. 7.8%, p < 0.01) and less frequent in Nx (50.5% vs. 56.8%, p < 0.01), with no difference between the N0 and N1a groups. The clinical outcome was similar in the 2 group of patients (88.2 % in the unifocal group vs. 90.2% in the multifocal group).  Conclusions:   Multifocality is more frequent in older and male patients, in smaller tumours, and in N1b.

This holds particularly for people living with HIV (PLHIV) who might have a non-communicable disease (like hypertension), which also requires a lifetime treatment. In this study, we investigated the association between hypertension and other possible factors on ART toxicity markers in patients with hypertension, compared to those without hypertension.  Methods:   This retrospective longitudinal study reviewed chronic patient files of 525 patients (of which 222 were hypertensive) who satisfied the inclusion criteria and were on ART at a hospital in central Eswatini. Specific levels of estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were used as drug toxicity markers. To analyze the longitudinal data between the exposure of interest and outcome variables, a Generalized Estimated Equation method was employed.  Results:   Participants with hypertension had decreased eGFR compared to those without hypertension (β = -2.22; p-value = 0.03). There was no significant association between ALT, AST and hypertension (p-value = 0.34 and 0.20, respectively). Factors that were found to have a significant association with ART toxicity markers included age, sex, ART duration, hypertension treatment and time of study. The eGFR was found to be significantly increasing over the study period (p-value < 0.001) for all participants. The significance was consistent in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive participants independently (p-value = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively). The overall trends of ALT and AST over time were also significant (p-value = 0.003 and <0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   Patients with hypertension had decreased eGFR, and there was a significant association of eGFR with time of the study. Special attention, therefore, to monitor calamities which are indicated by a decrease of eGFR (like renal impairment) should be given in PLHIV on ART with hypertension, especially more so if they were on ART for longer time.""","""['Sabelo Bonginkosi Dlamini', 'Ming-Tsang Wu', 'Hans-Uwe Dahms']""","""[' Department of Public Health, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', ' PhD Program in Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', ' Research Center for Precision Environmental Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', ' Department of Family Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', ' Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', ' Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Sep""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Factors associated with prognostic or treatment outcomes in HIV/AIDS patients with and without hypertension in Eswatini.', 'Hepatotoxicity During Isoniazid Preventive Therapy and Antiretroviral Therapy in People Living With HIV With Severe Immunosuppression: A Secondary Analysis of a Multi-Country Open-Label Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.', 'Prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension in people living with human immunodeficiency virus on antiretroviral therapy in Gweru district, Zimbabwe.', 'Relative risk of renal disease among people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of location (maxilla versus mandible) of multiple gingival recessions on 24 months clinical and aesthetic outcomes of modified coronally advanced tunnel with subepithelial connective tissue graft. Forty patients with multiple gingival recessions (GR) located at maxillary or mandibular teeth were treated between January 2018 and December 2019. Reduction in GR, average root coverage (ARC), complete root coverage (CRC), increase in keratinized tissue width (KTW), increase in gingival thickness (GT), and aesthetic evaluation with the root coverage esthetic score (RES) were evaluated after 24 months. Thirty patients with 270 recessions in the upper teeth and ten patients with 90 recessions in the lower teeth completed the 2-year recall. The differences between preoperative and postoperative clinical parameters showed statistical significance only within but not between groups. ARC at 2 years was 93.31% for maxillary teeth and 93.06% for mandibular teeth (p = 0.7906). Mean RES values were comparable for upper and lower teeth (9.25 versus 8.92, respectively, p = 0.6733).

In view of 2017 United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) criteria for SLKT, we investigated the likelihood and predictors of renal recovery among patients who met the aforementioned criteria yet received liver transplant alone (LTA).  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed relative renal recovery (RRR; increase in eGFR to >30 ml/min) in adult LTA recipients between 1/2009 and 1/2019.  Results:   Of 1165 LT recipients, 54 met 2017 UNOS criteria, with 37 receiving LTA. RRR occurred in 84% of LTA recipients, none of whom had pre-LT eGFR <20 ml/min. Sustained RRR (>180 days) occurred in 43% of patients. While prolonged pre-LT severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min) predicted failure to have sustained RRR (HR .19 per 90-day, CI .04-.87, p < .005), having an eGFR measurement of >30 ml/min within 90 days pre-LT (HR 5.52, CI 1.23-24.79, p .01) associated with achieving sustained RRR. Sustained RRR was protective against the composite outcome of renal replacement therapy, kidney transplant, and death (HR .21, p .01).  Conclusion:   LT candidates who meet 2017 UNOS criteria for SLKT yet undergo LTA can still have relative renal recovery post-LT, exceeding 80% on short-term follow-up and 40% on long-term follow-up. eGFR trends within 90 days pre-LT can predict sustained renal recovery, which appears protective of adverse outcomes.

The correlation between IC types and variations in adjacent anatomical structures (Haller cell, middle nasal concha pneumatization, maxillary sinus mucosal thickening and septa) was evaluated. The distance between Infraorbital Canal and Cnine Root (IC-CR) was also measured. For type 3, measurements were performed on IC as the length of the bony septum from the IC to the Mxillary Sinus Wall (IC-MSW), the distance from the inferior orbital rim, where the IC begins to protrude into the maxillary sinus (IOR-ICP), the vertical distance from the IC to the Maxillary Sinus Roof (IC-MSR) and Floor (IC-MSF).  Results:   The prevalence of type 1, 2 and 3 was 62.9%, 29.1%, and 8% respectively. IC-CR was 10.2, 10.7 and 11.4 mm in type 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness, the applicability and the utility of intraoperative ultrasound (IU), for the localization of small ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions in the parenchyma, as a guide in finding their margins in a deflated lung.  Materials and methods:   We included 15 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic resection of GGOs via VATS in the Thoracic Surgery Unit of the University of 'Luigi Vanvitelli' of Naples from November 2019 to December 2021. They were under general anaesthesia, when the lung had been collapsed, the probe was placed in the region where the target lesion was thought to reside on the basis of low-dose computed tomography scanning. GGO could be identified their sizes, echo levels and posterior echo was recorded by IU when the lung was completely deflated.  Results:   We conducted a retrospective single-centre study. All GGOs were identified by IU. The mean size and depth were 14.1 ± 0.5 and 4.8 ± 0.3 mm, respectively. Six (40%) lesions had hyperechoic patterns, 9 (60%) had mixed echogenicity where the hyperechoic patterns were irregularly mixed with hypoechoic patterns. The final diagnoses included 2 (15%) atypical adenomatous hyperplasia; 2 (15%) adenocarcinomas in situ; 3 (23%) minimally invasive adenocarcinomas and 6 (46%) invasive adenocarcinomas.

Methods:   From November 2021 to February 2022 in the Lanzhou University Second Hospital, the US features of 54 patients with renal allograft were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups: stable group(n = 44) and CR group(n = 10), with clinical diagnosis as reference standard. The vascular index (VI) on mSMI and parenchymal stiffness were measured in the middle cortex of all renal allografts and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the feasibility of differentiation. Statistically significant US features and biochemical indicators such as creatinine were scored, and the results of the scores were analyzed by ROC curve.  Results:   The VI on mSMI of the stable group (49.5±2.0) was significantly greater than that of the CR group (33.8±5.9) (P = 0.028). There was a statistically significant difference in parenchymal stiffness between stable group (16.2kPa±1.2) and CR group (33.9kPa±6.6) (P = 0.027).

Notably, males are four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with autism. Despite efforts to increase representation and characterization of autistic females, research studies consistently enroll small samples of females, or exclude females altogether. Importantly, researchers often rely on standardized measures to confirm diagnosis prior to enrollment in research studies. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of one such measure (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS) on research inclusion/exclusion rates by sex in autistic adults, all of whom had a preexisting community diagnosis of autism (n = 145, 95 male, 50 female). Using the ADOS as a confirmatory diagnostic measure resulted in the exclusion of autistic females at a rate over 2.5 times higher than that of autistic males. We compared sex ratios in our sample to those in other large, publically available datasets that rely either on community diagnosis (6 datasets, total n = 42,209) or standardized assessments (2 datasets, total n = 214) to determine eligibility of participants for research. Reliance on community diagnosis rather than confirmatory diagnostic assessments resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios. These results provide evidence for a ""leaky"" recruitment-to-research pipeline for females in autism research. LAY SUMMARY: Despite efforts to increase the representation of autistic females in research, studies consistently enroll small samples of females or exclude females altogether. We find that despite making up almost 50% of the initially recruited sample based upon self-report of community diagnosis, autistic females are disproportonately excluded from research participation as a result of commonly used autism diagnostic measures. In our sample, and several other publically available datasets, reliance on community diagnosis resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios.""","""[""Anila M D'Mello"", 'Isabelle R Frosch', 'Cindy E Li', 'Annie L Cardinaux', 'John D E Gabrieli']""","""[' McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', ' Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA.', ' Hock E.

Many sources of interferences are described but their management remains uncertain depending on the measurement system; we aimed at developing an optimized scheme allowing the accurate management of most interferences affecting RBCs, based on the alternative ""optical"" parameters from SYSMEX XN-10.  Methods:   Samples from 12 groups of relevant interferences were analysed and compared with a control group allowing (1) the determination of deviation thresholds beyond which an interference is likely, and (2) the development of two flowcharts for their subsequent management. These flowcharts were then evaluated among a bank of retrospective typical cases of interferences and in the routine flow of the laboratory.  Results:   After verifying the excellent agreement between standard and alternative parameters, the comparative study between analytical channels allowed to determine an acceptable deviation and then discriminate technical concerns caused by cold agglutinins, leukocytosis and plasma-related interferences. This led to the development of flowcharts ensuring the accurate management of these interferences, whether MCHC is <320 or >365 g/L. These proposed flowcharts allowed the correction of 63/65 historical confirmed interferences cases (97%). Furthermore, they corrected 18 results among 901 unselected prospective samples.  Conclusion:   The resulting flowcharts allow a relevant correction for most common interferences affecting RBCs and are now definitively included in the routine analytical management and will be directly incorporated in the middleware of the laboratory.""","""['Sylvain Henry', 'Delphine Gérard', 'Sylvain Salignac', 'Julien Perrin']""","""[' INSERM, UMR_S 1116, Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France.', "" CHRU Nancy, Service d'hématologie biologique, Pôle Laboratoires, Nancy, France.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Int J Lab Hematol""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Evaluation of a routine hematology analyzer for quality control of leukoreduced plasma.', 'Use of the reticulocyte channel warmed to 41°C of the XN-9000 analyzer in samples with the presence of cold agglutinins.', 'Impact of hyperleucocytosis on erythrocytic parameters of cell blood count: management by Sysmex XN-10 RET analyzer.', 'Short preheating at 41°C leads to a red blood cells count comparable to that in RET channel of Sysmex analysers in samples showing cold agglutination.']"""

Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are high-resolution laser and light-based techniques that provide real-time imaging of the alveolar compartment during bronchoscopy with a different depth and field of view.  Objectives:   The aim of the study was to correlate OCT and CLE imaging to HRCT imaging in ILD.  Methods:   This is a retrospective case series of 20 ILD patients who underwent alveolar CLE and OCT imaging during a standard bronchoscopy with BAL, followed by a lung biopsy when indicated. CLE and OCT imaging were compared to four main HRCT patterns and histology. The final diagnosis was based on the multidisciplinary discussion diagnosis.  Results:   Bronchoscopic CLE and OCT imaging were feasible and safe and provided additional high-detailed anatomical information compared to the HRCT. Bronchoscopic real-time CLE was capable of identification of ""alveolar cells"" (ground glass opacities) and lung fibrosis (increased alveolar elastin fibers). Bronchoscopic real-time OCT allowed for visualization of ""patchy fibrotic disease"", ""honeycombing"" (microcysts), and mucosal granulomas in the airways.

Background:   Despite increased operator experience and better devices, vascular complications after TAVR are still a major issue and covered stent implantation is often required.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected baseline and procedural data about 78 consecutive patients who underwent BE stent implantation to manage a vascular complication after transfemoral TAVR. Primary endpoints were technical success, incidence of new-onset claudication and need for vascular interventions during long-term follow-up. Secondary endpoints included length of hospitalization, in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and major postoperative complications.  Results:   BE stents implantation to manage vascular complications after TAVR was successfully performed in 96.2% of the cases, with bailout surgery required in two cases. One patient suffered in-hospital death. Predischarge Doppler Ultrasound revealed no cases of in-stent occlusion or fracture. At a median follow-up of 429 days (interquartile range, 89-994 days), no cases of symptomatic leg ischemia were reported and only one patient experienced new-onset claudication.  Conclusions:   Our experience showed good periprocedural and long-term results of BE covered stent implantation to manage vascular complication after TAVR.

Risk prediction tools are commonly to predict patients' outcomes and assign them to the most appropriate care setting. The STUMBL score is a prognostic model for BTT, derived and validated in the United Kingdom; items comprising the score are age, number of rib fractures, use of pre-injury anticoagulants, chronic lung disease and oxygen saturation levels. This study's aim was to validate the STUMBL score in an Italian ED.  Methods:   This single-centre retrospective validation study was conducted in the ED of Santa Croce and Carle hub hospital in Cuneo, north-western Italy. All patients with an ED attendance for isolated BTT from 2018 to 2021 were included. Exclusion criteria were an age of under eighteen and the presence of any immediately life-threatening lesion. The primary outcome was the development of trauma-related complications, defined by the occurrence of one or more of the following: in-hospital mortality, pulmonary complications (infection, pleural effusion, haemothorax, pneumothorax, pleural empyema), need for intensive care unit admission, hospital length of stay equal to or greater than seven days. The performance of the STUMBL score was analysed in terms of discrimination with the evaluation of the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and with the calibration belt.  Results:   745 patients were enroled (median age 64 [25th;75th percentile: 50;78], male/female ratio 1:4, median Charlson comorbidity index 2 [1;4], median STUMBL score 11 [6;17]). 65.2% of patients were discharged home after ED evaluation. 203 patients (27.2%) developed the primary outcome. The STUMBL score was significantly different in patients with complications compared to those without complications (9 [5;13] vs 21 [17;25], p < 0.001).

Methods:   A non-neurosurgical management protocol for adult minimal TBI was implemented at a level I trauma center as an interdisciplinary quality-improvement initiative in November 2018. Minimal TBI was defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 secondary to blunt mechanism, without anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, and isolated pneumocephalus and/or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT imaging. Safety was assessed by in-hospital mortality, neurosurgical interventions, and ED revisits within two weeks of discharge. Effectiveness was assessed by neurosurgical consult rate and length of stay. Outcomes were compared 8-months pre- and post-protocol implementation.  Results:   A total of 97 patients were included, of which 49 were pre-protocol and 48 were post-protocol There was no difference in rates of in-hospital mortality [0 (0%) vs 0 (0%)], neurosurgical procedure [1 (2.1%) vs 0 (0%)], operations [0 (0%) vs 0 (0%)], and ED revisits [1 (2.0%) vs 2 (4.2%), p = 0.985] between the periods. There was a significant reduction in neurosurgical consults post-protocol implementation (92% vs 29%, p<0.001).

Technical and clinical success, complications, and stent patency were retrospectively evaluated. Nine relevant variables were analyzed to determine risk factors for stent failure.  Results:   In 20 of 21 patients (95.2%), the GDA stump was completely excluded with covered stent placement. Immediate hemostasis was achieved in the 20 patients and rebleeding from jejunal artery occurred in one patient which was successfully embolized one day after the stent placement. There was no procedure-related complication or early mortality (<30 days). During follow-up period (median 655.5 days), stent thrombosis was found on CT in 10 patients (50.0%, 10/20) without any laboratory or CT abnormalities. One thrombosed stent migrated into the jejunum 20 months after placement. The six-month, one-year, and two-year stent patency were 81.9%, 52.9%, and 37.8%, respectively (median 620 days). The recurrence of primary malignancy was associated with stent failure (HR 5.70; 95% CI 1.18-27.76, p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Covered stent placement is an effective and safe management of postoperative GDA stump hemorrhage. Stent failure occurred frequently (50%) but did not cause liver ischemia.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, females with clinically node-positive BC who received NST and followed by surgery between January 2017 and September 2021 were included. All axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) on MRI were matched with pathology by ALN markers or sizes. MRI morphological parameters, signal intensity curve (TIC) patterns and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of post-NST ALNs were measured. The clinicopathological characteristics was also collected and analyzed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent predictors of axillary pCR.  Results:   Pathologically confirmed 137 non-pCR ALNs in 71 patients and 87 pCR ALNs in 87 patients were included in this study.

The two-stage treatment using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by LC is the treatment of choice for CCL. However, only 10 to 60% of patients have common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of ERCP, thus exposing patients to unnecessary ERCPs, causing 3 to 15% of post-interventional pancreatitis. One-stage laparoscopic-endoscopic rendezvous (LERV) is an alternative for the treatment of CCL. Given the selective top-to-bottom CBD cannulation, LERV reduces the risk of pancreatitis and failed CBD cannulation. Additionally, LERV is performed exclusively in patients presenting CBD stones at intraoperative cholangiography, avoiding unnecessary ERCPs. Despite its advantages, considering the logistical burden of coordinating different specialties, LERV is performed in few centers. Here, we present the largest retrospective series of LERVs performed at our department, analyzing elective and emergency procedures.  Methods:   All consecutive patients undergoing LERV for CCL between January 2014 and December 2021 were included. LERV success rate, operative time, biliary outflow restoration rate, postoperative complications (POC), length of hospital stay (LOS), and recurrences were analyzed.  Results:   181 patients were included (61 elective LERVs, 120 emergency LERVs). We reported a 100% LERV success rate, a 97.79% biliary outflow restoration rate, a 0% conversion rate, a mean intraoperative time of 120.17 ± 31.35 min, and LOS of 4.00 ± 2.82 days. POC included 7 Clavien-Dindo type 1, 11 type 2, and 3 type 3 cases. Seven patients presented with CBD stone recurrence: 2 within 30 days after discharge, 3 within 6 months after discharge, and 2 patients at 1 year. No statistically significant difference was found between elective and emergency patients.  Conclusion:   LERV is safe, representing a valid option even in emergency settings, thus enabling the management of CCL within a single procedure, consequently sparing additional anesthesia and decreasing post-ERCP complications.""","""['Margherita Pizzicannella#', 'Manuel Barberio#', 'Alfonso Lapergola', 'Matteo Gregori', 'Francesco Andrea Maurichi', 'Stefano Gallina', 'Pierluigi Benedicenti', 'Massimo Giuseppe Viola']""","""[' Endoscopy Unit, Ospedale Card.

Methods:   RT planning Computed Tomography (CT) images were fused separately with pre-operative MRI and PET/MRI images of 10 glioblastoma patients, retrospectively. The contrast-enhanced area in T1 weighted MRI was contoured as gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV1) was obtained by including the cavity and T2/FLAIR hyperintense areas after giving a margin of 2 cm to the GTV. 68Ga-PSMA uptake area was contoured as biological tumor volume (BTV) and CTV2 was obtained with a margin of 2 cm to BTV. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were created with the 3 mm added to the CTVs. Conformity index (CI), dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and overlap volume (OV) were calculated by obtaining the intersection and union volumes. Volumetric comparison, similarity and overlap analyzes were performed statistically by Wilcoxon signed rank and One sample t-test.  Results:   The median GTV was 21,96 cc (1,04 - 82,04) and BTV was 25,58 cc (2,43 - 99,47). BTV was on average 47% larger than GTV which was statistically significant (p = 0.03).

Methods:   In this retrospective multicenter study, patients with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent initial endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage between 2002 and 2014 were included. The success of drainage was defined as a successful biliary stent or drain placement, no unscheduled reintervention within 14 days, and serum bilirubin levels <50 μmol/L (ie, 2.9 mg/dL) or a >50% decrease in serum bilirubin after 14 days. Severe complications, and 90-day mortality were recorded.  Results:   Included were 186 patients: 161 (87%) underwent initial endoscopic biliary drainage and 25 (13%) underwent initial percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. The success of initial drainage was observed in 73 patients (45%) after endoscopic biliary drainage and 6 (24%) after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. The reasons for an unsuccessful initial drainage were: the failure to place a drain or stent in 39 patients (21%), an unplanned reintervention within 14 days in 52 patients (28%), and the bilirubin level >50 μmol/L (or not halved) after 14 days of initial drainage in 16 patients (9%). Severe drainage-related complications occurred in 19 patients (12%) after endoscopic biliary drainage and in 3 (12%) after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.

Yet, the sparse literature has built upon retrospective data.  Methods:   This study recruited 686 college students who were currently using e-cigarettes from three campuses in the Midwest and South of U.S in Fall 2019-Fall 2021. An on-line survey was conducted to measure e-cigarette use patterns, GPA, e-cigarette and alcohol dependence symptoms, and respiratory symptoms. A 7-day ecological momentary assessment was used to collect real-time data on e-cigarette and alcohol use, situational contexts and subjective effects.  Results:   Frequent drinking e-cigarette users reported more high-risk use behavior including consuming 6 + drinks/occasion and simultaneous use, and reported more e-cigarettes and alcohol related dependence symptoms and respiratory symptoms, compared to infrequent/non-drinker e-cigarette users. Alcohol quantity was positively associated with e-cigarette quantity among the high frequency drinking group. This study identified important use contexts that were associated with higher e-cigarette consumption including use of menthol or fruit flavored e-cigarettes, being in a car, and the presence of others. E-cigarette use and alcohol use both increased the levels of positive affect, physiological sensation, and craving for e-cigarettes, whereas only alcohol use significantly decreased negative affect. No interaction effects between e-cigarette use and alcohol use were found.

The current practice is to salvage as much of the limb/digit as possible with the use of thrombolytic and adjuvant therapies. Sequelae from amputation can include severe nerve pain and poor wound healing requiring revision surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the rate of revision surgery after primary amputation and compare this to revision surgery in isolated hand/foot burns. Frostbite and burn patients from 2014 to 2019 were identified in the prospectively maintained database at a single urban burn and trauma center. Patients with primary amputations related to isolated hand/foot burns or frostbite were included in the study. Descriptive statistics included Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. A total of 63 patients, 54 frostbite injuries and 9 isolated hand or foot burns, met inclusion criteria for the study. The rate of revision surgery was similar following frostbite and burn injury (24% vs 33%, P = .681). There were no significant differences in age, sex, or length of stay on the primary hospitalization between those that required revision surgery and those that did not. Neither the impacted limb nor the presence of infection or cellulitis on primary amputation was associated with future need for revision surgery. Of the 16 patients requiring revision surgery, 5 (31%) required additional debridement alone, 6 (38%) required reamputation alone, and 5 required both. A total of 6 patients (38%) had cellulitis or infection at the time of revision surgery. Time from primary surgery to revision ranged from 4 days to 3 years. Planned, delayed primary amputation is a mainstay of frostbite management. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of revision surgery in the setting of severe frostbite injury. Our observed rate of revision surgery following frostbite injury did not differ significantly from revision surgery in the setting of isolated hand or foot burns.

This retrospective study included 140 consecutive patients with severe carotid stenosis. These patients underwent preprocedural carotid vessel wall imaging to evaluate the plaque status. We analyzed the incidence of initial clinical symptoms, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, after CAS. The primary outcomes analyzed were the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within 30 days of CAS. Sixty-seven patients (47.9%) had IPH, and 53 (38.9%) had ulcers on carotid wall imaging/angiography. Sixty-three patients (45.0%) had acute neurological symptoms with positive diffusion-weighted image findings. Intraluminal thrombi on initial angiography and flow arrest during CAS were significantly higher in patients with IPH and symptomatic patients. Symptoms were significantly higher in patients with IPH than in those without (63.5% vs 35.1%, P < .001). There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms after stenting or in primary outcomes, regardless of IPH, ulcer, or initial symptoms.

Patient-level clinical prediction models such as the HCT-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) help identify those at increased risk for NRM, but the independent contribution of social determinants of health on HCT outcomes is not well characterized.  Methods:   This study included 1602 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2013 and 2019 at City of Hope. Census tract-level social vulnerability was measured using the social vulnerability index (SVI). Fine-Gray multivariable regression evaluated the association between SVI and 1-year NRM. Subgroup analysis examined risk of NRM across combined SVI and HCT-CI categories and by race and ethnicity.  Results:   Cumulative incidence of 1-year NRM after HCT was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.6% to 17.1%). In multivariable analysis, patients in the highest SVI tertile (highest social vulnerability) had a 1.4-fold risk (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78) of NRM compared with individuals in the lower tertiles; patients in the highest SVI tertile who also had elevated (≥3) HCT-CI scores had the highest risk (sHR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26 to 2.58) of 1-year NRM (reference: lower SVI tertiles and HCT-CI < 3). High social vulnerability was associated with risk of 1-year NRM in Asian (sHR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.09 to 3.78) and Hispanic (sHR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.55) but not non-Hispanic White patients.  Conclusions:   High social vulnerability independently associated with 1-year NRM after HCT, specifically among minority populations and those with a high comorbidity burden at HCT.

Though positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is more advantageous than computed tomorgraphy (CT) for detecting metastases, studies on the PET/CT prediction model for incomplete resection for ovarian cancer are insufficient. We analyzed and compared the predictive value of preoperative PET/CT score, CT score, metabolic parameters, tumor markers and hematological markers for incomplete resection after debulking surgery for ASOC.  Material and methods:   A total of 62 ASOC patients who underwent preoperative [18 F]FDG PET/CT and debulking surgery were retrospectively analyzed. PET/CT and CT scores were based on the Suidan model. The predictive value of PET/CT score, CT score, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for incomplete resection were analyzed and compared.  Results:   Preoperative PET/CT score had the highest predictive value for incomplete resection in primary debulking surgery group (sensitivity: 65.0%, specificity: 88.9%, area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.847, p < 0.001), however, in secondary debulking surgery group, preoperative PET/CT score and CT score had the same and highest predictive value for incomplete resection (sensitivity: 80.0%, specificity: 94.7%, AUC: 0.853, p = 0.017), compared with preoperative metabolic parameters SUVmax and MTV, tumor markers HE4 and CA125, and hematological markers LMR, PLR and NLR. Preoperative PET/CT score ≥ 3 (Suidan model) and preoperative PET/CT score ≥ 2 predicted a high risk of incomplete resection after primary and secondary debulking surgeries, respectively. There was no statistical difference between primary and secondary debulking surgery groups in predictive value of PET/CT score for incomplete resection (p = 0.971).

The aim of this study was to determine the pulp outcomes of permanent teeth with complicated crown fractures treated with pulpotomy in a hospital-setting and to identify potential factors which may influence the outcomes.  Material and methods:   Data for this retrospective study were extracted from dental records of patients with complicated crown fractures and treated with pulpotomies at a single centre between 1 January 2015 and 30 August 2019. Pulp outcomes were determined, and the associations between the outcome and independent variables were assessed using the Chi-Square test of independence and the Point-Biserial Correlation Test. Predictors of outcome were identified using the binary logistic regression model.  Results:   The overall success of pulpotomy in managing traumatised permanent teeth was 61%, which was lower than those previously reported. Pulp healing was seen in 54.1% and 73.7% of teeth treated with partial pulpotomies and coronal pulpotomies, respectively. The presence of a radiographically detectable dentine bridge (p < .01) and longer clinical experience of the clinician (p < .04) was significantly associated with successful outcomes. The history of pain and the stage of root development were identified as significant predictors of the outcome.  Conclusion:   Pulpotomy is a viable treatment modality for complicated crown fractures in the paediatric population. However, appropriate case selection and further training may be required to ensure improved pulp healing outcomes.

Melasma typically presents in women of reproductive age and can significantly impact self-esteem, negatively affecting one's quality of life. In the United States, melasma is often treated with application of topical agents that interfere with melanin synthesis, lasers, or chemical peels; however, in some East Asian countries, oral tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely administered to alleviate hyperpigmentation during and after childbirth. TXA is currently only FDA-approved to treat hypermenorrhea and reduce blood loss in surgery but may offer women in the United States an additional therapeutic option to treat melasma.  Aims:   The aim of this paper is to evaluate the safety and baseline efficacy of oral transmexic acid as a treatment for melasma.  Methods:   We retrospectively surveyed 42 patients of Fitzpatrick skin types III-VI that were prescribed 650 mg of TXA ½ tablet to be taken twice daily by mouth.  Results:   We found majority of patients saw noticeable improvement in their melasma. Of the 42 patients, only seven experienced side effects. The side effects noted were headaches, malaise and nausea, gastrointestinal upset, congestion, numbness in legs, hypomenorrhea, and hypermenorrhea. Patients who experienced unpleasant side effects discontinued taking oral TXA and were relieved of their symptoms. No long-term side effects were discovered, and the side effects experienced may be due to other confounding factors.

The clinical features, survival, and burden of toxicities of patients with aNSCLC alive >1 year from ICI initiation are poorly understood.  Materials and methods:   We defined ICI survivors as patients alive >1 year after ICI start and retrospectively reviewed demographics, treatment, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Long-term irAEs were defined as ongoing irAEs lasting >1 year; burden of toxicity measures were based on percentage of days a patient experienced toxicity. Using linear and logistic regression, we evaluated association between demographics and disease characteristics with burden of toxicity.  Results:   We identified 114 ICI survivors from 317 patients with aNSCLC. Half (52%) experienced an irAE of any grade, and 23.7% developed long-term irAEs. More ICI survivors with irAES in the first year had never smoked (P = .018) or received ICIs as frontline therapy (P = .015). The burden of toxicity in the first year significantly correlated with the burden of toxicity afterward (ρ = 0.72; P < .001). No patients with progressive disease had a high burden of toxicity, and they experienced 30.6% fewer days with toxicity than those with stable disease. Increased duration of therapy was associated with higher odds of experiencing toxicity. Half of ICI survivors with irAEs were still receiving treatment for unresolved irAEs at time of death or last follow-up.  Conclusion:   Significant proportions of ICI survivors have unresolved long-term toxicities. These data support a growing need to understand long-term toxicity to optimize management of those treated with ICIs.""","""['Melinda L Hsu', 'Joseph C Murray', 'Kevin J Psoter', 'Jiajia Zhang', 'Durrant Barasa', 'Julie R Brahmer', 'David S Ettinger', 'Patrick M Forde', 'Christine L Hann', 'Vincent K Lam', 'Benjamin Levy', 'Kristen A Marrone', 'Tricia Patel', 'Valerie Peterson', 'Sarah Sagorsky', 'Michelle Turner', 'Valsamo Anagnostou', 'Jarushka Naidoo', 'Josephine L Feliciano']""","""[' Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ' Bloomberg-Kimmel institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ' Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ' Beaumont Hospital Dublin and RCSI University of Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Oncologist""","""['Peripheral Blood Markers Identify Risk of Immune-Related Toxicity in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Patterns of toxicity burden for FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors in the United States.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Safety and efficacy of restarting immune checkpoint inhibitors after clinically significant immune-related adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.', 'The determinants of very severe immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A\xa0prospective study of the French REISAMIC registry.']"""

Patients and methods:   One hundred and fifteen patients having undergone radical nephroureterectomy were analysed with histology in radical nephroureterectomy specimens as reference test and S-phase fraction as index test. Ploidy and S-phase were determined using flow cytometry. Differences in S-phase fraction were calculated between stages, grades (WHO 1999 and 2004 classifications), ploidy and patients that died of UTUC and those who did not. Five- and 10-year-cancer-specific survivals were calculated. Areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of S-phase fraction in relation to tumour stage and to death from UTUC were measured. Multiple Cox regression was performed.  Results:   Independent prognostic markers of death from UTUC were S-phase fraction and stage. Correlation between S-phase fraction and risk of dying from UTUC was strong, with a 17% greater risk of death from UTUC with every 1% increase in S-phase fraction, hazard ratio = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.10-1.25, p < 0.001, Spearman's rho ρ = 0.65. AUCs for S-phase fraction as predictors of stage and death from UTUC were 0.8 (95% CI = 0.705-0.894) and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.67-0.87), respectively. Cancer-specific survival was statistically significantly different between stages, ploidy and WHO 1999 grades, but not between WHO 2004 grades. This was also reflected in S-phase fraction, which differed in LG-G1 compared with LG-G2 and in HG-G2 compared with HG-G3.

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 15 patients with SNAC who were treated with arthroscopic bone grafting and percutaneous K-wire fixation and subsequently followed up for a minimum of 1 year between November 2009 and March 2018. The clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing the range of motion (ROM), grip strength, the modified Mayo Wrist Score, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, all of which were measured preoperatively and at the last follow-up. The radiologic outcomes were evaluated by comparing the scapholunate (SL) and radiolunate (RL) angles preoperatively and at the last follow-up. All 15 cases of nonunion were resolved. The average radiologic union time was 9.7 ± 1.2 weeks. The average VAS score increased from 5.7 ± 2.3 (range, 2 - 10) preoperatively to 1.3 ± 1.3 (range, 0 - 3) at the last follow-up (P < .05). The average modified Mayo wrist score increased from 58.3 ± 14.0 preoperatively to 80.0 ± 9.2 at the last follow-up (P < .05). The mean ROM of the wrist improved, but there was no statistical significance. At the last follow-up, the mean flexion and radial deviation on the affected side were significantly decreased, and the mean extension on the affected side was significantly improved compared to the normal side (P < .05). The mean preoperative SL and RL angles were 66 ± 11.9° and 7.2 ± 6.8°, respectively, and were decreased to 50.4 ± 7.5° and 6.4 ± 5.2°, respectively, at the last follow-up. The mean SL angle was significantly corrected (P = .01).

BBS is more commonly reported in adults and children than in fetuses. Here, a retrospective study on 210 fetuses with congenital renal malformation was conducted.  Methods:   The fetuses were diagnosed using invasive prenatal tests, including chromosome karyotype analysis, whole exome sequencing (WES), and single-nucleotide polymorphism array. We found the intrauterine phenotype of a fetus presenting enlarged kidneys, enhanced echo, and oligohydramnios; therefore, the fetus was characterized to have BBS.  Results:   Chromosome karyotype analysis presented normal results. Analysis using an Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array revealed 2 homozygous regions. However, WES revealed a homozygous mutation of c.1177C>T (p.Arg393*) on exon 12 of BBS1 and a heterozygous variation of c.2704G>A (p.Asp902Asn) on exon 22 of CC2D2A. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines identified c.1177C>T and c.2704G>A as a pathogenic mutation and of uncertain significance, respectively. Sanger sequencing identified heterozygous mutation, that is, c.1177C>T and heterozygous variation, that is, c.2704G>A in the parents of the fetus.

Shoulder arthroplasty is often required to restore function and quality of life. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), which was originally designed mainly for irreparable rotator cuff damage, has gained popularity in recent years for the treatment of advanced shoulder OA instead of the clinically standard total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). However, this RSA has some nonnegligible flaws such as higher complications rate and economic cost, not mention the following problems caused by irreversible physical structural damage. Therefore, the employment of RSA needs to be carefully considered. This study aimed to compare TSA and RSA in OA patients with or without rotator cuff damage to better guide clinical decision making. We believe the radical use of RSA in patients without rotator cuff deficiency may cause more harm than good. We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2011 to 2014 to collect information on OA patients who received TSA and RSA. Patients were divided into 2 groups of comparison according to the presence of rotator cuff deficiency and matched with propensity score analysis. A total of 57,156 shoulder arthroplasties were identified. RSA patients in the rotator cuff deficiency group had significant higher transfusion rates and longer hospital stays. RSA patients without rotator cuff deficiency had a statistically significantly higher number of implant-related mechanical complications, acute upper respiratory infections and postoperative pain. Overall, RSA incurred higher costs in both groups. For OA patients with rotator cuff deficiencies, RSA has its benefits as complication rates were comparable to TSA. For those patients without rotator cuff deficiencies, the use of RSA should be reconsidered as there were more complications with higher severity.""","""['Haifeng Liu', 'Tony Chieh-Ting Huang', 'Hanzhong Yu', 'Yicun Wang', 'Daping Wang', 'Zeling Long']""","""["" Department of orthopedic, Shenzhen University First Affiliated Hospital: Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ' Division of Plastic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ' Division of Digital Health Science, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ' Department of Orthopedics, Jinling Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Aug""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Clinical outcomes of reverse shoulder arthroplasty and rotator cuff repair in patients with massive rotator cuff tears without osteoarthritis: comparison using propensity score matching.', 'Value Analysis of Anatomic and Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty for Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis with an Intact Rotator Cuff.', 'Anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty in patients 70 years of age and older: a comparison cohort at early to midterm follow-up.', 'Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis is associated with excellent outcomes and low revision rates in the elderly.', 'Glenohumeral osteoarthritis with intact rotator cuff treated with reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a systematic review.']"""

Survival curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis of risk factors for progress-free survival. Propensity score matching was used for clinical characteristics to adjust for selection bias. Therapy discontinuation in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < .001).

Four independent risk factors for conversion to secondary hip arthroplasty were identified: age of ≤60 years (odds ratio [OR] = 9.786, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.735-35.015), male sex (OR = 6.790, 95% CI = 1.718-26.831), collapse of the femoral head before injury (OR = 7.170, 95% CI = 2.004-25.651), and femoral neck fracture (OR = 8.072, 95% CI = 2.153-30.261). A new scoring system was constructed for predicting conversion to hip arthroplasty in patients undergoing internal fixation treatment. A cutoff of ≤2 points indicated low risk for conversion, 3 to 4 points indicated moderate risk, and ≥5 points indicated high risk. Patients who underwent internal fixation had worse prognoses than those who underwent 1-stage hip arthroplasty. However, in this study, hip arthroplasty conversion did not occur in most patients who received internal fixation. Using the new scoring system to identify patients who may require conversion to replacement may help make appropriate patient management and clinical decisions.""","""['Xinguo Zhang', 'Sikai Liu']""","""["" Department of orthopedic, Shenzhen Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Osteonecrosis and Hip Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, People's Republic of China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Aug""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Total hip arthroplasty using a short-stemmed femoral component in the presence of a proximal femoral fixation device - a case report.', 'Primary total hip arthroplasty versus internal fixation in displaced fracture of femoral neck in sexa- and septuagenarians.', 'Management of femoral neck fracture post total knee arthroplasty.', 'Failed internal fixation due to osteonecrosis following traumatic periprosthetic fracture after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.', 'Avascular necrosis of the femoral head after femoral neck fracture.']"""

Therefore, early diagnosis is important. The aim of this study was to clarify the specific features of mandibular fractures in aged patients and the effect of age on possible missed diagnoses.  Material and methods:   Patients aged over 60 years with a recent mandibular fracture were included in the study. The outcome variable was a missed mandibular fracture during the patient's first assessment in the primary health care facility. Predictor variables were age group, categorized as older adults (aged ≥60 and <80 years), elders (aged >80 years), patient's age as a continuous variable and age sub-group divided into decades. Additional predictor variables were the patient's memory disease and injury associated with intracranial injury. Explanatory variables were gender, injury mechanism, type of mandibular facture, combined other facial fracture, edentulous mandible/maxilla/both, surgical treatment of the mandibular fracture, and scene of injury.  Results:   Mandibular fractures were missed in 20.0% of the 135 patients during their first healthcare assessment. Significant associations between missed fractures and age group, gender, fracture type, or injury mechanism were not found. By contrast, memory disorder (p = .02) and site of injury (p = .02) were significantly associated with missed fractures. Fractures were missed more frequently in patients who were in hospital or in a nursing home at the time of injury.  Conclusions:   There is an increased risk of undiagnosed mandibular fractures in the aged population. Small injury force accidents may cause fractures in old and fragile individuals.

However, little is known about young adult sepsis outcome differences in pediatric versus adult hospital settings. Material and Methods: Using Truven MarketScan database from 2010-2015, we compared in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay in young adults ages 18-26 treated for severe sepsis in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) versus Medical ICUs (MICUs)/Surgical ICUs (SICUs) using logistic regression models and accelerated time failure models, respectively. Comorbidities were identified using Complex Chronic Conditions (CCC) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: Of the 18 900 young adults hospitalized with severe sepsis, 163 (0.9%) were treated in the PICU and 952 (5.0%) in the MICU/SICU. PICU patients were more likely to have a comorbid condition compared to MICU/SICU patients. Compared to PICU patients, MICU/SICU patients had a lower odds of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for age, sex, Medicaid status, and comorbidities (adjusting for CCC, odds ratio [OR]: 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.89; adjusting for CCI, OR: 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.94). There was no difference in adjusted length of stay for young adults with severe sepsis (adjusting for CCC, Event Time Ratio [ETR]: 1.14, 95% CI 0.94-1.38; adjusting for CCI, ETR: 1.09, 95% CI 0.90-1.33). Conclusions: Young adults with severe sepsis experience higher adjusted odds of mortality when treated in PICUs versus MICU/SICUs. However, there was no difference in length of stay.

Methods:   The study comprised 29 pediatric patients diagnosed with permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia between 2011 and 2021 in 2 pediatric electrophysiology centers. From the file records, the basic demographic characteristics of the patients, as well as electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, were acquired retrospectively. The medical treatment and responses of the patients throughout follow-up, as well as the electrophysiological study and ablation data of the patients who had electrophysiological study, were assessed.  Results:   The mean age at diagnosis of the patients was 3.13 ± 4.43 (0-18) years and the mean weight was 18.22 ± 19.68 (3.8-94) kg. Eighteen patients (62.1%) were girls. Eleven patients (38%) developed tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Tachycardia was incessant in 15 patients (51.7%). In total, 22 patients required 26 ablation procedures. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and multidrug-resistant tachycardia were the most prevalent indications for ablation. The right posteroseptal pathway was detected in 18 patients (81.8%). The acute procedure success rate was 100% (22/22). The recurrence rate was 18% (4/22) and 3 of them underwent successful ablation again. The overall success percentage was 95.4% (21/22). None of the patients had any complications. The mean follow-up period was 4.39 ± 3.05 years.  Conclusion:   Although permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia is uncommon, it is often persistent, resistant to medical treatment, and associated with a substantial risk of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Catheter ablation can be performed on these patients at any age, with minimal risk of complications and a high success rate.

Study design:   Retrospective study.  Animals or sample population:   A total of 480 puppies from 90 bitches undergoing 106 c-sections.  Methods:   Medical records of c-sections performed between January 2012 and September 2021 were reviewed. Data collected included brachycephalic versus nonbrachycephalic breed, elective versus emergency c-section, litter size (c-section and total [including those born prior to and via c-section]), and neonatal survival to discharge. A generalized linear mixed model (univariable and multivariable) was performed to evaluate variables versus neonatal survival.  Results:   Overall neonatal survival to discharge was 93.1% (447/480); survival was similar between brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic breeds (p = .221, 202/213 [94.8%] brachycephalic survival, 245/267 [91.8%] nonbrachycephalic survival). Puppies delivered via elective c-section were more likely to survive compared to emergency c-section (p < .001, 238/240 [99.2%] elective survival, 209/240 [87.1%] emergency survival). Puppies delivered in larger c-section litters were more likely to survive (p < .004) compared to smaller litters. Total litter size had no effect on survival.  Conclusion:   Brachycephalism had no effect on neonatal survival. Puppies delivered via elective c-section were more likely to survive compared to puppies delivered via emergency c-section.  Clinical significance:   Outcomes following c-section are similar between brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic breeds.

The diagnosis performance of DECT in patients with solid lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) among NSCLC was further discusses. Two hundred fifteen patients confirmed with solid NSCLC were enrolled and analyzed retrospectively in this study. 148 patients were confirmed with LAC among all patients. Three expression levels of Ki-67 were determined by the percentage of Ki-67 positive cancer cells with immunohistochemistry: high-level group (>30%), middle-level group (10%-30%), and low-level group (≤10%). And the latter two levels also known as non-high-level group. The quantitative parameters of enhanced chest DECT (venous phase, VP), including iodine concentration (IC), water concentration (WC), CT value at 40 keV (CT40keV), the slope of energy spectral attenuation curve (λHU) and normalized iodine concentration (NIC) were measured and calculated by gemstone spectral imaging Viewer software. One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of normal distribution DECT parameters between three levels for patients with NSCLC and patients with LAC. Non-normal distribution data were tested by non-parametric test. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve of statistically significant DECT parameters was drawn to distinguish the non-high-level and the high-level of Ki-67. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity was calculated to measure the diagnostic performance of parameter. Both in solid NSCLC and LAC, the IC, NIC, WC, λHU and CT40keV at VP in the high-level group were significantly lower than those in the middle- and low-level group respectively, and the WC at VP in the high-level group was significantly higher than that in the middle- and low-level group respectively (all P < .05). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that IC and λHU at VP performed better in distinguishing the high-level and the non-high-level of Ki-67 (NSCLC: AUC = 0.713 and 0.714 respectively; LAC: AUC = 0.705 and 0.706 respectively).

The French national reference center of angioedema (CREAK) provides emergency physicians with a hotline and a guideline to help them manage their patients. This study aimed to describe the clinical features of AE episodes prompting a call on the CREAK hotline and classify patients depending on the suspected cause of the AE.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the novel precut technique in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion. This retrospective study included 22 patients who underwent pleural biopsy using the precut technique to examine exudative pleural effusion of unknown etiology. Thoracoscopy was performed under local anesthesia. The biopsy procedure was performed as follows: a needle was inserted into the pleura around the lesion using a semiflexible thoracoscope; the needle was positioned to make an incision in the pleura while injecting 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and lifting the pleura from the fascia; 2 or 3 precut incision lines were arranged in a triangle; and the specimen was obtained from the parietal pleura using forceps or a cryoprobe. Patient data including age, number of biopsies, biopsy specimen size, pathological and final diagnosis, and postoperative complications were examined. All patients were male with an average age of 74 years. Pleural effusion was found on the right and left sides in 16 and 6 patients, respectively. The average major axis of the biopsy specimens was 18 mm (range, 10-30 mm), which was sufficient to establish a pathological diagnosis.

Traditionally, cesarean section or hysterectomy is used to stop bleeding. This study aims to investigate the method for termination of mid-trimester pregnancy with placenta previa, especially emergency uterine artery embolization (UAE) combined with cervical double balloon (CDB).  Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted based on 261 cases of mid-pregnancy termination in our hospital, where 34 cases with placenta previa were set as the observation group, and the remaining 227 cases were set as control group. At first, the termination method of Mifepristone combined with Misoprostol/Ethacridine Lactate was adopted. If the volume of prenatal bleeding was up to 400 mL, emergency uterine artery embolization (UAE) was implemented to stop bleeding, then cervical double balloon (CDB) was used to promote cervical ripening. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was performed to assess the accuracy in predicting the length of placental edge crossed the cervical os for prenatal bleeding.  Results:   The number of gravidity/parities, the rate of cesarean section, the medical cost, the rate of previous cesarean section were all higher in the observation group than in the control group (P < .05). The volume of prenatal hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, the rate of puerperal morbidity, emergency UAE rate and ICU rate were higher in the observation group than in the control group (P < .05). There were 4 cases showing prenatal hemorrhage up to 400 mL and undergoing emergency UAE + CDB in the observation group, while there were no such cases in the control group (P < .05). An optimal cut-off value of 1.7cm for the length of placental edge crossed the cervical os in diagnosing prenatal hemorrhage demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 75.0% and 86.7%, respectively (area under the ROC curve, 0.858).  Conclusion:   The combined therapy of mifepristone and Misoprostol/Ethacridine Lactate was useful for termination of mid-trimester pregnancy with placenta previa, and attention needs to be attached to prenatal hemorrhage during labor induction.

The inadequate recovery of the knee extension strength of surgical limb reportedly delays return to sports and increases reinjury risk. Accordingly, the early detection of knee extension strength deficits after reconstruction may help plan early interventions to manage impairment. This study aimed to clarify the association between knee extension strength at 3 and 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.  Design:   Retrospective study.  Methods:   Fifty patients who underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring grafts were included. At 3 months postoperatively, the limb symmetry index (LSI) of isokinetic knee extension strength (IKE) at 60°/s, degree of swelling, passive range of motion of knee flexion and extension, and anterior leg reach distance were measured. At 6 months postoperatively, the LSI of IKE was measured at 60°/s, which was used as the main outcome. A correlation analysis was performed with the LSI of IKE at 6 months postoperatively as the dependent variable and the LSI of IKE at 3 months postoperatively as the independent variable. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was performed, with LSI of IKE at 6 months postoperatively as the dependent variable; LSI of IKE at 3 months postoperatively as the independent variable; and other variables, demographic information, and surgical data as covariates.  Results:   The correlation analysis revealed that the LSIs of IKE at 3 and 6 months postoperatively were correlated (r = .535, P < .001). In the multiple regression analysis, the LSI of IKE at 3 months postoperatively was significantly associated with that at 6 months postoperatively, even when other variables were included as covariates (R2 = .349, P = .004).

Few data on long-term outcome are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall patient and graft survivals and associated predictive factors.  Method:   This retrospective multicentre study included adult transplant patients for NAFLD cirrhosis between 2000 and 2019 in participating French-speaking centres.  Results:   A total of 361 patients (69.8% of male) were included in 20 centres. The median age at LT was 62.3 years [57.4-65.9] and the median MELD score was 13.9 [9.1-21.3]; 51.8% of patients had HCC on liver explant. Between 2004 and 2018, the number of LT for NAFLD cirrhosis increased by 720%. A quarter of the patients had cardiovascular history before LT. Median follow-up after LT was 39.1 months [15.8-72.3]. Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years after LT was 89.3%, 79.8% and 68.1% respectively. The main causes of death were sepsis (37.5%), malignancies (29.2%) and cardiovascular events (22.2%). In multivariate analysis, three risk factors for overall mortality after LT were recipient pre-LT BMI < 32 kg/m2 at LT time (OR: 2.272; p = .012), pre-LT angioplasty during CV check-up (OR: 2.916; p = .016), a combined donor and recipient age over 135 years (OR: 2.020; 95%CI: p = .035).

On one hand, it supports differential diagnosis (DD) since most skin conditions have specific predilection sites. On the other hand, location matters for dermatosurgical interventions. In practice, lesion evaluation is not well standardized and anatomical descriptions vary or lack altogether. Automated determination of anatomical location could benefit both situations.  Objective:   Establish an automated method to determine anatomical regions in clinical patient pictures and evaluate the gain in DD performance of a deep learning model (DLM) when trained with lesion locations and images.  Methods:   Retrospective study based on three datasets: macro-anatomy for the main body regions with 6000 patient pictures partially labelled by a student, micro-anatomy for the ear region with 182 pictures labelled by a student and DD with 3347 pictures of 16 diseases determined by dermatologists in clinical settings. For each dataset, a DLM was trained and evaluated on an independent test set. The primary outcome measures were the precision and sensitivity with 95% CI. For DD, we compared the performance of a DLM trained with lesion pictures only with a DLM trained with both pictures and locations.  Results:   The average precision and sensitivity were 85% (CI 84-86), 84% (CI 83-85) for macro-anatomy, 81% (CI 80-83), 80% (CI 77-83) for micro-anatomy and 82% (CI 78-85), 81% (CI 77-84) for DD. We observed an improvement in DD performance of 6% (McNemar test P-value 0.0009) for both average precision and sensitivity when training with both lesion pictures and locations.  Conclusion:   Including location can be beneficial for DD DLM performance. The proposed method can generate body region maps from patient pictures and even reach surgery relevant anatomical precision, e.g. the ear region.

Methods:   A total of 283 ruptured HCC patients treated at our liver surgery center were included in our study, of which 175 were treated with hepatectomy and 108 were treated with TACE. To reduce selection bias, we used a propensity score matching (PSM) model, which yielded a total of 88 pairs of patients. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to compare the long-term prognosis, and the Landmark method was used to compare the short-term and long-term prognoses of patients after PSM. Finally, we performed subgroup analysis according to whether it met the Milan criteria.  Results:   After PSM, in the hepatectomy group, the 1-, 3-, and 5 year OS rates were 73.4%, 45.4%, and 33.9%, respectively. In the TACE group, the 1-, 3-, and 5 year OS rates were 58.5%, 40.6%, and 23.2%, respectively.

Are patients with LANC invading carotid artery are at risk of massive neck hemorrhage after radiotherapy?  Methods:   This retrospective study included 130 LANC patients with carotid artery invasion admitted to our hospital between January 2012 and September 2019. All patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) ± epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors were conducted for the prognosis and the occurrence of massive neck hemorrhage of LANC patients with carotid artery invasion.  Outcomes:   The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), local nodal recurrence-free survival (LNRFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS) and overall survival (OS) of the 130 patients were 75.2%, 76.8%, 90.0%, 93.9%, 95.8% and 87.2%, respectively. The incidence of fatal bleeding after radiotherapy was 2.3% (3/130). The primary site of the three cases were all the pharyngeal recess, with more than 270° carotid artery invasion, suffering nasopharyngeal necrosis after radiotherapy (2 of which were diabetics and 1 received re-radiation after recurrence). Univariate analysis showed that clinical stage was negatively correlated with DMFS and PFS (P < 0.05). The induction chemotherapy TP regimen, platinum-based concurrent chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors (Nituzumab/Cetuximab) significantly improved PFS and DMFS (P < 0.05). Patients with hemoglobin levels > 110 g/L had significantly inferior PFS, DMFS and OS than those with hemoglobin levels ≤ 110 g/L (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the EGFR inhibitor was an independent risk factor for PFS and DMFS, while the lowest hemoglobin level was an independent risk factor for OS.  Conclusions:   In LANC patients whose carotid artery invasion was < 270°, induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by helical tomotherapy (HT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor had mild and tolerable side effects, better PFS and DMFS, with no massive hemorrhage.

The introduction of radiomics to image segmentation is desirable but challenging.  Purpose:   This study aims to develop and validate a radiomics-based framework for image segmentation (RFIS).  Methods:   RFIS is designed using features extracted from volume (svfeatures) created by sliding window (swvolume). The 53 svfeatures are extracted from 11 phantom series. Outliers in the svfeature datasets are detected by isolation forest (iForest) and specified as the mean value. The percentage coefficient of variation (%COV) is calculated to evaluate the reproducibility of svfeatures. RFIS is constructed and applied to the gross target volume (GTV) segmentation from the peritumoral region (GTV with a 10 mm margin) to assess its feasibility. The 127 lung cancer images are enrolled. The test-retest method, correlation matrix, and Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) are used to select non-redundant svfeatures of statistical significance from the reproducible svfeatures. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique is utilized to balance the minority group in the training sets. The support vector machine is employed for RFIS construction, which is tuned in the training set using 10-fold stratified cross-validation and then evaluated in the test sets. The swvolumes with the consistent classification results are grouped and merged. Mode filtering is performed to remove very small subvolumes and create relatively large regions of completely uniform character. In addition, RFIS performance is evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).  Results:   30249 phantom and 145008 patient image swvolumes were analyzed. Forty-nine (92.45% of 53) svfeatures represented excellent reproducibility(%COV<15). Forty-five features (91.84% of 49) included five categories that passed test-retest analysis. Thirteen svfeatures (28.89% of 45) svfeatures were selected for RFIS construction. RFIS showed an average (95% confidence interval) sensitivity of 0.848 (95% CI:0.844-0.883), a specificity of 0.821 (95% CI: 0.818-0.825), an accuracy of 83.48% (95% CI: 83.27%-83.70%), and an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.904-0.908) with cross-validation. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were equal to 0.762 (95% CI: 0.754-0.770), 0.840 (95% CI: 0.837-0.844), 82.29% (95% CI: 81.90%-82.60%), and 0.877 (95% CI: 0.873-0.881) in the test set, respectively. GTV was segmented by grouping and merging swvolume with identical classification results. The mean DSC after mode filtering was 0.707 ± 0.093 in the training sets and 0.688 ± 0.072 in the test sets.

The gold standard for osteosynthesis is a one-third tubular or lateral locking plate and compression screwing or use of tension band wiring, with complete weight bearing planned around the 6th week. The development of locking plates seems to allow earlier resumption of weight bearing. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results after internal fixation of bimalleolar fractures using locking plates with complete weight bearing authorized from the outset. The hypothesis was that this does not predispose to cutaneous or mechanical complications.  Hardware and method:   A continuous multi-operator retrospective study was performed. The clinical and radiological data of 55 patients operated on for bimalleolar fractures were collected. All underwent osteosynthesis with medial and lateral locking plates with authorization for weight bearing from the outset.  Results:   Complete weight bearing was resumed at 27.4 days 14.7 [7-60] postoperatively. No non-union or malunion was found. Two patients presented with delayed medial healing without the need for hardware removal. Two patients required removal of the lateral Plate 1 month postoperatively due to infection. Seven patients presented with discomfort related to hardware, justifying its removal at 1 year. The Kitaoka score at 1 year was 94.6 7.7 [71-100].

A retrospective study""","""Introduction:   Lateral malleolar fractures are present in about 90% of ankle fractures. The standard treatment is plate osteosynthesis. Although the plates are thin, the risk of cicatricial complications is not insignificant and can lead to cutaneous or even infectious complications and the latter can cause functional repercussions. We therefore aimed to evaluate a technique consisting of osteosynthesis of the lateral malleolus using two cerclages and two intramedullary pins.  Hypothesis:   Our hypothesis is that the use of osteosynthesis by pin/cerclage of the lateral malleolus makes it possible to have objective reduction criteria, similar to the reference treatment.  Methods:   This is a retrospective study of patients who had an interligamentous spiral fracture of the lateral malleolus. One group of patients had internal fixation of the lateral malleolus fracture by pins, and the other by plate. Our primary outcome was to compare the reduction of the fracture of the lateral malleolus between the two techniques using the ""Dime sign"", the measurement of the talocrural angle and respect for Shenton's line.  Results:   A total of 118 lateral malleolar fractures were included: 56 patients (47.5%) in the ""pin"" group and 62 patients (52.5%) in the ""plate"" group. The mean age of the patients was 46.6 years (17.4) with an average body mass index of 25.2kg/m2 (4.8) and 55.1% of the patients were women. We found a difference in the reduction criteria between the two groups by looking at Shenton's line: 73.2% (41/56) of postoperative X-rays in the ""pin"" group respected Shenton's line, compared to 90.3% (56/62) in the ""plate"" group (p=0.02). We did not find any difference regarding the ""Dime sign"" and the talocrural angle.  Conclusion:   Our study shows the superiority of plate osteosynthesis for lateral malleolar fractures compared to pin/cerclage osteosynthesis, regarding one of the three radiological criteria for reduction. No significant difference was found in the one-year rates of complications and of hardware removal, between the two groups.

However, the literature does not report any superiority of this technique over others in terms of return to duty and sport.  Hypothesis:   The ST4E system allows a return to military duty at least equivalent to the semitendinosus and gracilis graft (STG) with screw fixation.  Material and method:   A total of 133 soldiers operated on for ACL were included, 64 by the STG technique and 69 by ST4E, with an average follow-up of 4 years. The return to duty was assessed, with recovery of skills between the first and second postoperative year, as well as the medico-administrative status at the last follow-up, muscle recovery through isokinetic tests, the sports level before/after surgery, and the failure rate.  Results:   No difference was found in the return to the soldier's previous post between the STG (64%) and the ST4E (64%) (p=0.97). No difference was found for the medico-administrative status at the last follow-up, but the short-term muscle recovery, the return to sport, and the failure rate were in favor of the ST4E group.  Discussion:   The ST4E, adjustable double endobutton system, is comparable to the STG technique in terms of return to military duty. On the other hand, it offers faster muscle recovery with better sports results and fewer patients on prolonged sick leave (PSL). This study demonstrated that two-thirds of soldiers operated on for anterior cruciate ligamentoplasty regained their initial aptitude regardless of the technique used, which influences the army's operational capacity and on disability pension requests after service.

Methods and materials:   LSFs in 52 planning and LDs in 44 treatment procedures were retrospectively calculated, in consecutive radioembolization patients over a 2 year interval, using 99m Tc-MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging. For each procedure, multiple planar LSFs and LDs were calculated using different: (1) contours, (2) views, (3) liver 99m Tc-MAA shine-through compensations, and (4) lung mass estimations. The accuracy of each planar-based LSF and LD methodology was determined by calculating the median (range) absolute difference from SPECT/CT-based LSF and LD values, which have been demonstrated in phantom and patient studies to more accurately and reliably quantify the true LSF and LD values.  Results:   Standard-of-care LSF using geometric mean of lung and liver contours had median (range) absolute over-estimation of 4.4 percentage points (pp) (0.9 to 11.9 pp) from SPECT/CT LSF.

This article aims to explore the safety, effectiveness, and short-term prognosis of laparoscopic segment 4b+5 liver resection for T3 stage gallbladder cancer.  Methods:   This is a retrospective multicenter propensity score-matched study. Disease-free survival, perioperative complications, and intraoperative safety were analyzed to evaluate safety and effectiveness.  Results:   There was no significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative bleeding, number of lymph nodes obtained, postoperative complications, or disease-free survival (DFS) between the open group (OG) and laparoscopic group (LG) (P > 0.05). The DFS time of the S4b+5 resection group (S4b5) was longer than that of the wedge group (P = 0.016). Cox regression showed that positive margins (HR, 5.32; 95% CI 1.03-27.63; P = 0.047), lymph node metastasis (HR, 2.70; 95% CI 1.31-5.53; P = 0.007), and liver S4b+5 resection (HR, 0.30; 95% CI 0.14-0.66; P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for DFS. The operative time of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided liver S4b5 segment resection was shorter than that of traditional laparoscopic S4b+5 resection guided by hepatic veins (P ≤ 0.001).

Our aim was to evaluate our ongoing transport strategy (OT), which is an MS/DS hybrid. In our OT, the patient is transported directly to the CT of the Primary Stroke Centre (PSC), where intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is administered. The patient then continues without delay to a Comprehensive Stroke Centre (CSC) with the same medical rescue team (MRT). The distance between our centres is 73 km.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively analysed data of 100 consecutive AIS-LVO patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2017 and October 2019. OT, MS and DS groups were compared. 31 patients were transported as MS, 32 as DS, and 37 as OT.  Results:   DS had significantly longer time to groin puncture (185 min) compared to OT and MS (p < 0.0001). OT shortened time almost to MS level (OT 124 min, MS 110 min, p = 0.002. Time to IVT administration (from MRT departure) differed statistically significantly in favour of OT (OT 27 min, MS 63 min, p < 0.0001).

Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of Crohn's disease are, however, at increased risk of developing Crohn's disease of the pouch. Crohn's disease of the pouch can also occur in people with a preoperative diagnosis of ulcerative colitis; however, it is unknown whether this phenotype is similar to classic Crohn's disease involving an intact bowel, or whether it is a distinct entity.  Objective:   This study aimed to describe Crohn's disease of the pouch, including luminal inflammation, and fibrostenotic and perforating phenotypes, as well as management of these conditions.  Results:   Crohn's disease of the pouch can present in similar ways as classic Crohn's disease, classified as either inflammatory, fibrostenotic, or penetrating. Criteria involving the diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch are stringent to prevent unnecessary treatments, because a diagnosis of Crohn's disease after IPAA for presumed ulcerative colitis can cause mental anguish. Treatment of Crohn's disease of the pouch depends on the presenting phenotype, although therapies are similar to classic Crohn's disease. Endoscopic, or even surgical treatment, may be required for fibrostenotic and fistulizing diseases.  Limitations:   Crohn's disease of the pouch is a newly described disease of patients who undergo an ileoanal pouch anastomosis; and therefore, most of the evidence comes from retrospective trials in patients with an initial diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.  Conclusions:   While Crohn's disease of the pouch is controversial and perhaps a distinct disease within the spectrum of inflammatory bowel diseases, it nonetheless requires long-term medical therapy and close follow-up.""","""['Seth R Shaffer', 'Charles N Bernstein']""","""[' Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba, IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Dis Colon Rectum""","""[""Redo IPAA After a Failed Pouch In Patients With Crohn's Disease: Is It Worth Trying?"", ""Diagnostic and Management Considerations for the IPAA With Crohn's Disease-Like Features."", ""Do clinical characteristics of de novo pouch Crohn's disease after restorative proctocolectomy affect ileal pouch retention?"", ""Crohn's disease and indeterminate colitis and the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: outcomes and patterns of failure."", 'Perianal Fistula After Ileoanal Pouch in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis: A Review of 475 Patients Operated on at a Major IBD Center.']"""

Even experienced endoscopists may miss or misdiagnose lesions due to heavy workload or fatigue or subtle changes in lesions under white-light endoscopy (WLE). This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that could diagnose six common gastric lesions under WLE and to explore its role in assisting endoscopists in diagnosis.  Methods:   Images of early gastric cancer, advanced gastric cancer, submucosal tumor, polyp, peptic ulcer, erosion, and lesion-free gastric mucosa were retrospectively collected to train and test the system. The performance of the system was compared with that of 12 endoscopists. The performance of endoscopists with or without referring to the system was also evaluated.  Results:   A total of 29,809 images from 8947 patients and 1579 images from 496 patients were used to train and test the system, respectively. For per-lesion analysis, the overall accuracy of the system was 85.7%, which was comparable to that of senior endoscopists (85.1%, P = 0.729) and significantly higher than that of junior endoscopists (78.8%, P < 0.001). With system assistance, the overall accuracies of senior and junior endoscopists increased to 89.3% (4.2%, P < 0.001) and 86.2% (7.4%, P < 0.001), respectively. Senior and junior endoscopists achieved varying degrees of improvement in the diagnostic performance of other types of lesions except for polyp. The diagnostic times of senior (3.8 vs 3.2 s per image, P = 0.500) and junior endoscopists (6.2 vs 4.6 s per image, P = 0.144) assisted by the system were both slightly shortened, despite no significant differences.

Methods:   Cases with cell blocks containing adequate tumor cells and surgical resections were included. Ki-67 immunostain was retrospectively performed on cell block sections, and Ki-67 index was calculated on the ""hot spot"" areas.  Results:   This study included 50 GIST cases from stomach (n = 45; 90%), duodenum (n = 4; 8%), and distal esophagus (n = 1; 2%). The tumor size ranged from 1.5 cm to 21 cm (mean, 5.4 cm). Based on the mitotic count, 37 GISTs (74%) had low mitotic rate (LMR) and 13 GISTs (26%) had high mitotic rate (HMR). The spindle cell, epithelioid, and mixed types accounted for 60%, 14%, and 26% of GIST, respectively. Ki-67 index counted on cell block sections correlated well with mitotic count evaluated in surgical specimens (r = 0.8031). Mean Ki-67 index was higher in HMR than LMR groups (3.5% vs. 1%, p < .001). The receiver operating characteristic curve using Ki-67 index to predict mitotic rate was further analyzed, and area under the curve was 0.839. Using a cutoff of 2.5% yielded a sensitivity of 70% at 92% specificity.

However, long-term effects and its optimal application protocol with gradual reduction have not been studied. Accordingly, we analysed the clinical response of OLP to tacrolimus in our daily clinical practice with a focus on the optimal long-term therapeutic scheme.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients diagnosed with OLP and treated with topical tacrolimus (0.03% oral rinse) in a clinical setting between 2015 and 2020. The objective clinical response was measured by a 4-point scale (complete remission, major remission, partial remission and no response), and subjective impairment by a 3-point scale (severe, moderate and none).  Results:   Fifty-seven patients (74% women; median age: 66 years) were included. Fifty-six (98%) patients had prior treatment with topical steroids. After introduction of tacrolimus, objective remission (major or complete) was reached by 28%, 62%, 87% and 97% of patients after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. Subjective remission was reported by 16%, 48%, 69% and 83% after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment respectively. The treatment frequency could be gradually reduced from initially twice daily to once daily or less in 28%, 61%, 78% and 87% after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months respectively; 41% of patients completely suspended the treatment at one point, but 67% of them experienced a relapse after a median time of 3.3 months. Four patients (7%) developed a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) during the observation period. Otherwise, there were only few and minor side-effects.  Conclusion:   Topical tacrolimus can be an effective second-line therapy for OLP refractory to potent topical corticosteroids. The therapy frequency can often be reduced during the maintenance period. Both signs of clinical activity and subjective impairment should guide therapy.

Methods:   We consecutively reviewed the clinical data and OCT images of the patients with HMMHs from June 2015 to February 2021. Then we picked eyes with MRS from these HMMHs for analysis. The minimum linear diameter (MLD), basal diameter (BD), and height (H) of HMMHs were measured. HMMHs were grouped according to the extent or layer involvement of the concomitant MRS and the characteristics were compared among groups. The impact of MRS on the MLD of macular hole was analyzed with multivariable linear regression.  Results:   We included 127 patients with MRS from 168 HMMHs (75.5%) for analysis. According to the different classification systems, the most frequent type of MRS in HMMHs was S3 (foveal but not entire macular area MRS) (62.2%) and both inner- and outer- (I/O-MRS) involved types. In our study, HMMHs with more extensive MRS had larger MLD, larger BD, larger H, and poorer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Meanwhile, HMMHs with outer layer-involved MRS (outer MRS and I/O-MRS) had larger BD than HMMH with only inner layer-involved MRS. (All P < 0.05) Multivariable linear regression further illustrated only the extent of MRS was significantly associated with the MLD of HMMH, while there was no significant correlation between the involved retinal layers and the MLD of HMMH.

Baseline differences in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer""","""Although the antitumor effects of antihypertensive drugs for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) have been investigated, their efficacy remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that hypertensive (HT) patients with APC are significantly older than non-HT patients with APC, and that other major baseline differences in patient characteristics which may affect prognosis exist between HT and non-HT patients. It is also possible that antihypertensive drugs lack antitumor activity. Therefore, we herein retrospectively investigated the baseline differences between HT and non-HT patients with APC. From January 2015 to April 2020, 56 patients with APC received nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy at Higashiosaka City Medical Center (Higashiosaka, Japan). Of these 56 patients, 30 were diagnosed with hypertension (HT group); the remaining 26 did not have hypertension (non-HT group). Differences between the two groups were compared and prognostic factors were evaluated. Patients in the HT group had significantly less sarcopenia, a significantly larger body mass index, were significantly older, and significantly more likely to have a regular doctor and primary site in the body and tail of the pancreas than those in the non-HT group. Although no significant difference was found in the treatment response, patients in the HT group were significantly more likely to move to second-line chemotherapy than those in the non-HT group. Survival curves showed that median overall survival (OS) in the HT group was significantly longer (10.5 months) than in the non-HT group (6.8 months, P = .04). Multivariate analysis did not identify the use of antihypertensive drugs as an independent prognostic factor of OS. We identified key baseline differences in the characteristics of APC patients with and without HT, suggesting that major selection bias could occur when investigating the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in all populations. Therefore, it is possible that antihypertensive drugs lack antitumor activity. To determine the true efficacy of antihypertensive drugs for APC, HT, and non-HT patients in another population should be investigated, or a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted that is stratified by HT or non-HT status.""","""['Kiyotsugu Iede', 'Terumasa Yamada', 'Masami Ueda', 'Yujiro Tsuda', 'Shinsuke Nakashima', 'Katsuya Ohta', 'Tsukasa Tanida', 'Jin Matsuyama', 'Masakazu Ikenaga', 'Shusei Tominaga']""","""[' Departments of Clinical Oncology and Higashiosaka City Medical Center, Higashiosaka, Japan.', ' Gastroenterological Surgery, Higashiosaka City Medical Center, Higashiosaka, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jul""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Erratum: Do antihypertensive drugs really have antitumor effects?

It is therefore very important to provide effective symptom management after diagnosis of anastomotic fistula. Placing the gastrointestinal decompression tube beside the anastomotic site and connecting the tube to a gastrointestinal decompression disk could support the prevention and treatment of anastomotic fistula after surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. Thirty-eight patients with anastomotic fistula after undergoing McKeown esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in our hospital from April 2017 to January 2021 were divided equally into control and observation groups according to the gastrointestinal decompression method used. Gastrointestinal decompression tubes were placed 45 to 50 cm from the incisors in the control group or 25 to 30 cm from the incisors in the observation group. The treatment efficacy was compared between the 2 groups. The drainage time, length of hospital stay after anastomotic fistula detection, and fistula healing time in the observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group (P < .05 for all).

Among the 4 indicators, serum albumin had the best diagnostic efficacy based on the area under the ROC curve (0.933), sensitivity (89.09%), and specificity (81.54%). The area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity for the combined diagnostic model of the 4 indices were 97.8%, 98.18%, and 90.77%, respectively, which had good predictive power for the relapse of patients.

Recent studies showed that the small-volume bowel cleansing agent Bowklean performs better in terms of tolerability and acceptability. However, its split-dose regimen is sometimes confusing to the patient. To promote Bowklean in Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital, dedicated staff for patient education on bowel preparation were provided by Universal Integrated Corporation (Taiwan), but not in every period because of the clinic room availability and manpower capacity. This provided us an opportunity to compare the quality of colonoscopy between those with and without the dedicated patient education. This study aimed to compare various quality indices between the two groups. We set bowel preparation quality as the primary endpoint, assessed by modified Aronchick scale, and other quality indices including procedure time and adenoma detection rate as the secondary endpoints. We performed a single institution retrospective study. All patients who received colonoscopy from an outpatient setting with Bowklean as the bowel cleansing agent from October 2020 to November 2020 were reviewed. Primary and secondary endpoints were then compared between the conventional group and the dedicated staff group, with StataSE 14 by Wilcoxon rank sum test or logistic regression. Four hundred ten patients were recruited, including 217 patients with dedicated patient education and 193 without. The proportion of bowel preparation quality ""Excellent + Good + Fair"" was significantly higher in dedicated staff group than conventional group (97.7% vs 93.3%, P = .03; logistic regression coefficient = 1.12). The cecal intubation time was significantly shorter in the dedicated staff group (3.68 ± 2.02 minutes vs 4.52 ± 3.25 minutes, P < .01). After excluding those with polypectomy or biopsy, the total procedure time tended to be shorter in the dedicated staff group (10.2 ± 3.35 minutes vs 9.40 ± 2.43 minutes, P = .06). There was no significant difference regarding adenoma detection rate between the two groups.

Design:   Multicenter, international, retrospective, consecutive series.  Subjects:   Patients with ROP treated with anti-VEGF injections from 2007 to 2021.  Methods:   Twenfty-three sites (16 United States [US] and 7 non-US) participated. Data collected included demographics, birth characteristics, examination findings, and methods of injections. Comparisons between US and non-US sites were made.  Main outcome measures:   Primary outcomes included number and types of retreatments as well as complications. Secondary outcomes included specifics of the injection protocols, including types of medication, doses, distance from limbus, use of antibiotics, and quadrants where injections were delivered.  Results:   A total of 1677 eyes of 918 patients (43% female, 57% male) were included. Mean gestational age was 25.7 weeks (range, 21.2-41.5 weeks), and mean birth weight was 787 g (range, 300-2700 g). Overall, a 30-gauge needle was most commonly used (51%), and the quadrant injected was most frequently the inferior-temporal (51.3%). The distance from the limbus ranged from 0.75 to 2 mm, with 1 mm being the most common (65%). Bevacizumab was the most common anti-VEGF (71.4%), with a dose of 0.625 mg in 64% of cases. Overall, 604 (36%) eyes required retreatment. Of those, 79.8% were retreated with laser alone, 10.6% with anti-VEGF injection alone, and 9.6% with combined laser and injection. Complications after anti-VEGF injections occurred in 15 (0.9%) eyes, and no cases of endophthalmitis were reported. Patients in the United States had lower birth weights and gestational ages (665.6 g and 24.5 weeks, respectively) compared with non-US patients (912.7 g and 26.9 weeks, respectively) (P < 0.0001). Retreatment with reinjection and laser was significantly more common in the US compared with the non-US group (8.5% vs. 4.7% [P = 0.0016] and 55% vs. 7.2% [P < 0.001], respectively). There was no difference in the incidence of complications between the 2 geographic subgroups.  Conclusions:   Anti-VEGF injections for ROP were safe and well tolerated despite a variance in practice patterns.

However, its benefits over laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) remain undetermined. Previous studies were limited by their small sample size or variations in surgeon skills. This study aimed to compare robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) performed by a single surgeon with LDP performed by skilled laparoscopic surgeons in a high-volume center.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed consecutive RDP performed by a single surgeon between December 2020 and November 2021 with LDP performed by experienced surgeons during the same period in a high-volume center. Patient characteristics and perioperative variables were compared.  Results:   The analysis included 55 RDP and 146 LDP procedures. The operative time in the RDP group was significantly shorter than the LDP group (171 vs. 222 min, P < 0.001), both in spleen-preserved (154 vs. 212 min, P < 0.001) and spleen-removed (192 vs. 230 min, P = 0.005) procedures. The RDP group made more frequent use of the stapler technique for pancreas transection (87.3 vs. 68.5%, P = 0.007), and its estimated blood loss was lower (79 vs. 155 mL, P < 0.001) than the LDP group. The postoperative hospital stay in the RDP group was significantly shorter than the LDP group (8 vs. 12 days, P < 0.001). The groups were similar in their complication distributions.  Conclusion:   RDP is as safe and feasible a minimally invasive approach as LDP.

The literature is rather poor on preserving talar vascularization in single or dual approaches. A dual approach allows better exposure and should limit devascularization. Locking plates are one of the modern solutions for challenging comminuted fractures. The aim of this study was to determine clinical and radiological outcomes in complex talar fracture (CTF) of the neck and body, fixed by locking plates through a dual approach with at least one locking plate.  Hypothesis:   Locking-plate fixation of CTF through a dual approach leads to good clinical outcome.  Material and methods:   A single-center retrospective study included 12 cases of CTF treated between January 2007 and May 2019. 3D CT was systematically performed to plan surgery. A dual approach and at least one locking plate were used for fixation. Clinical outcome was evaluated on AOFAS score. Reduction quality and correlation to clinical results were evaluated, reduction with<2mm joint step being considered satisfactory. Consolidation rate and occurrence of avascular necrosis of the talus (ANT), post-traumatic arthritis (PTA) and postoperative complications were analyzed.  Results:   Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 15-47). Mean AOFAS score was 70±18 (range, 30-97). Inframillimetric reduction was achieved in 67% of cases, without significant correlation with clinical results. The consolidation rate was 91.6%, ANT rate 18.2% and PTA rate 45.5%.

The functional results of TTC are deemed to be inferior because of the double joint sacrifice. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), as well as satisfaction scores, are commonly used to assess the outcome of these surgeries, but lack at capturing patients' ability to cope with potential functional limitations. The objective of our study was to compare the results of TAA, TT and TTC arthrodeses according to patients' point of view. We proposed two hypotheses: 1) TAA confer better results than TT arthrodeses, 2) and TT arthrodeses confer better results than TTC arthrodeses, on this specific criterion.  Material and methods:   We carried out a retrospective study integrating all TAA, TT and TTC arthrodeses performed in our center from 2010 to 2017. These surgeries were compared using PROMs (Foot Function Index (FFI), Foot and Ankle Outcome Scale (FAOS) and 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12)), a satisfaction rating and self-reported perceived recovery state.  Results:   Fifty-one patients were included in the TAA group, 50 in the TT group and 51 in the TTC group. The mean duration of follow-up was 46±20.8 months. The TAA group had better results than the TT group regarding the FFI score and satisfaction, thus confirming our primary hypothesis. On the other hand, no significant difference was found between the TT group and the TTC group, which invalidated our secondary hypothesis. No significant difference between the groups was found regarding the distribution of patients' perceived recovery state.  Conclusion:   Our hypothesis was not confirmed. In fact, TAAs, TT and TTC arthrodeses presented substantially similar results. Although it is difficult to compare surgeries with different indications, it is surprising to find that the patients' perceived recovery state, deviating from the usual clinical and radiological results, are relatively similar.

Methods:   This study enrolled 103 patients diagnosed with LA-HPSCC and treated with radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy between 2008 and 2021. The optimal PLR cut-off value was chosen from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. According to the cut-off value of PLR, patients were divided into two groups: a low PLR group (< 133.06) and a high PLR group (≥ 133.06). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the confounding factors between the two PLR groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models, the Kaplan-Meier curve by the log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate Fine-Gray competing risk models were all used for assessment.  Results:   After PSM, 27 pairs were left, and the high PLR group correlated with higher local failure (sHR 6.91, 95% CI 2.14-22.35, p = 0.001) in the multivariate Fine-Gray competing risk model.

Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) is a treatment of choice for СD, which effectiveness range is from 70 to 90%. Recurrence rate after successful treatment is about 25%. If surgical treatment is unsuccessful or recurrence appear, radiation treatment is the next therapeutic option, which effectiveness range is also 90%, but the hypopituitarism rate as side effect of treatment is higher. Preoperative predictors of remission and recurrence are still unexplored what leads to further investigations.  Aim:   Analysis of remission and recurrence rates of pediatric CD after successful treatment according to preoperative MRI and therapeutic option.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 90 pediatric patients with CD who were observed between 1992 and 2020 at the Endocrinology Research Centre.  Results:   The most common clinical symptoms of CD were weight gain [94%] and growth retardation [72%]. Pituitary tumor was detected on radiological imaging in 53/90 patients [59%], there were no signs of visible adenoma in 37/90 of patients [41%]. 63 of 90 patients underwent TSS (70%), 27 patients underwent radiosurgery (30%). Remission rate after TSS was 71% [45/63], after radiosurgery - 85% [23/27]. There were no significant differences in remission rates after radical treatment according to preoperative MRI results (P=0.21 after TSS and P=0.87 after radiosurgery, х2 analysis). Recurrence after successful treatment was diagnosed in 10 patients. There were no significant differences in time to recurrence according to preoperative MRI results (P=0.055, х2 analysis). Time to recurrence was statistically different after TSS compared to radiosurgery (P=0.007, Kaplan-Meier analysis) and in the group with developed adrenal insufficiency in the early postoperative period (P=0.04, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Analysis of side effect of treatment showed that the frequency of growth hormone and gonadotrophin deficiency was statistically higher after radiosurgery (р&lt;0.01, Kruskel-Wallis ANOVA test). Diabetes insipidus was diagnosed only after TSS.  Conclusion:   Results of our study didn`t allow to use MRI-results as predictor of effectiveness treatment in pediatric CD.

This study aimed to determine whether LG is particularly beneficial for gastric cancer patients with sarcopenia.  Methods:   We collected data concerning 604 consecutive patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2003 and December 2019. After adjustment using one-to-one propensity score matching, short-term and long-term outcomes were compared between LG and open gastrectomy (OG) groups among patients with sarcopenia and those without.  Results:   Among patients with and without sarcopenia, the LG group had a significantly longer operative time but less blood loss than the OG group. The two groups showed no significant differences regarding complications. Although 5-year overall and disease-specific survival were similar between LG and OG groups among patients with and without sarcopenia, LG was associated with greater 5-year non-gastric cancer-related survival than OG among patients with sarcopenia (88.3% vs. 78.1%, P = 0.048), but not those without.  Conclusion:   LG for resectable gastric cancer was not inferior to OG regarding complications and outcomes in patients with or without sarcopenia.

The aim of this work was to study the learning curve of MIS TME in the proficiency phase.  Method:   Risk-adjusted (RA) cumulative sum (CUSUM) and RA Bernoulli CUSUM charts were plotted for sequential MIS TME performed by a surgical team over 1000 cases. Surgical failure, a composite endpoint of conversions, complications of grade IIIA or above, R1 resections and inadequate nodal yield were used to monitor the performance.  Results:   The RA CUSUM detected an inflection point around the 600th operation. Two peaks were identified that could be traced back to probable causes of surgical failure. Similar inflection points were detected at the 450th case for laparoscopic TME and the 367th case for sphincter preservation. No single definite threshold point was noticed for robotic or abdominoperineal operations. At no point did the curves cross the safety threshold. The probability of surgical failure reduced with increasing experience in the multivariate regression (OR 0.899, p = 0.000). This association persisted irrespective of the surgical approach (laparoscopic versus robotic) or the type of operation (sphincter preservation versus abdominoperineal resection).

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 23 patients who underwent endoscopic stapes surgery at our institution between 2019 and 2021. The nerve classification previously reported, the modified nerve classification (attached long type is divided into Category 1: lenticular process is visible with 0° endoscope and Category 2: not visible), selected approach (Pre C or Post C), use of a 30° endoscope, and manipulation of the nerve (number of contacts and traction, with or without suction, with or without malposition or extension and amputation, and damage score) were evaluated.  Results:   The damage score was significantly lower in the Pre C group (p < 0.05); however, using this approach for all cases is not desirable owing to the high risk of damage to the nerve during posterior malpositioning.

A universally optimum threshold for ferritin may be incorrect, and another view is that ESA and iron are alternative anemia treatments, which should be selected based on the likely response to each. Hemodialysis patients developing moderate anemia were randomised to treatment with either an increase in ESA or a course of intravenous iron. Over 2423 patient-months in 197 patients, there were 133 anemia episodes with randomized treatment. Treatment failure was seen in 20/66 patients treated with ESA and 20/67 patients treated with iron (30.3 vs. 29.9%, p = 1.0). Successful ESA treatment was associated with lower C-reactive protein (13.5 vs. 28.6 mg/L, p = 0.038) and lower previous ESA dose (6621 vs. 9273 μg/week, p = 0.097).

A four-variable iron preference score was developed to indicate the more favorable treatment, which in a retrospective analysis reduced treatment failure to 17%.

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified the SUVmax changes threshold most associated with MPR. Most of the patients were pathologically diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and received anti-PD-1 antibodies plus chemotherapy. The immunotherapy regimens included nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and camrelizumab. MPR was observed in more than half of lesions.

The aim of this study was to describe the type of care and modalities of integration of specialized PC in a population of relapsed and/or metastatic head and neck cancer patients, followed in a single institution over 4 years.  Methods:   Between January 2016 and December 2019, data on patients with relapsed and/or metastatic head and neck cancer not suitable for curative treatment diagnosed at the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland were reviewed retrospectively. Site, type and lines of treatment, treatment response, referral to specialist palliative care (yes or no), type of symptoms, tracheostomy and/or feeding-tube presence, and site of death were documented. Comparisons were made between patients benefitting from PC integration vs standard care.  Results:   Eighty-six patients with relapsed/metastatic HNC were identified, 63 (73.3%) of whom were referred to specialized PC. Patients were mainly men (66, 76.7%), with a median age of 69 years (range 44-95). The most common site of tumour was the oropharynx (31, 36%), followed by the larynx (21, 24.4%), oral cavity (19, 22.1%), hypopharynx (14, 16.3%), and unknown primary (1, 1.2%). Forty-four patients (51.2%) were treated with systemic treatment. The median time interval between the diagnosis and palliative care referral was 1.7 months. At the time of our analysis, 69 patients had died (58 in the PC group and 11 in the non-PC group). Fifteen patients (25.9%) in the PC group and 4 (36.4%) in the non-PC group had received aggressive treatment (chemotherapy, tracheostomy and/or feeding tube) in the last month of life, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.44). There was no difference in the incidence of home death (19.1% PC group vs 9.1% non-PC group, p = 0.67) or presence of caregiver (69.8% PC group vs 78.2% non-PC group, p = 0.58) between groups, while palliative care was associated with more opioid use (90.5% vs 17.4%, p < 0.0001). Patients in the PC group had a shorter survival compared to the non-PC group (5.7 vs 19.9 months, p = 0.0063).

Design:   Retrospective interventional case series.  Participants:   In total, 87 eyes from 87 patients with idiopathic ERM who underwent pars plana vitrectomy with peeling of the ERM from 2019 to 2020 were included.  Methods:   The outcomes of clinical ophthalmic examination, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), before and after surgery were reviewed. Surgical specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis.  Main outcomes measures:   The association between morphological characteristics revealed on SD-OCT images and the cellular composition of the surgically excised ERM demonstrated with immunohistochemical staining were the main outcome measures. Changes in the BCVA and central macular thickness (CMT) were assessed through a comparison of preoperative and postoperative measurements.  Results:   Based on SD-OCT morphological characteristics in the foveal area, 15 cases were classified into group 1A (mainly outer retinal thickening), 39 into group 1B (more tenting of the outer retina and distorted inner retina), and 33 into group 1C (prominent inner retina thickening). Overall, postoperative final BCVA and CMT at 1 year improved in all groups. Patients who presented with a better initial BCVA exhibited a more favorable final BCVA. Epiretinal membranes in group 1C demonstrated the greatest decrease in CMT compared with those in groups 1B and 1A, but the final CMT did not differ among the groups. A negative correlation between the density of hyalocytes (P = 0.003) and myofibroblasts (P = 0.047) was noted between the 3 groups. Total cell density and glial cell density of the ERMs were strongly associated with poor final BCVA and BCVA improvement.  Conclusions:   The present study provides new histopathologic information regarding the formation and progression of idiopathic ERM. Glial cell proliferation plays a predominant role in these processes. Epiretinal membranes with high cellularity and glial cell density may cause damage to the retina structure, resulting in poor postoperative visual outcomes. These findings provide additional evidence supporting early surgical intervention in patients with idiopathic ERM reported with visual disturbance.""","""['Lei-Chi Wang', 'Wen-Jung Lo', 'Ya-Yun Huang', 'Yu-Bai Chou', 'An-Fei Li', 'Shih-Jen Chen', 'Teh-Ying Chou', 'Tai-Chi Lin']""","""[' Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Education and Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.

Optimal timing of ferritin assessment and the merit of longitudinal values remains unclear. Methods: Patients admitted to Henry Ford Hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were studied. Regression models were used to determine the relation between ferritin and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and days on the ventilator. Results: 2265 patients were evaluated. Patients with an initial ferritin of > 490 ng/mL had an increased risk of death (OR 3.4, P < .001), admission to the ICU (OR 2.78, P < .001) and need for mechanical ventilation (OR 3.9, P < .001). There was no difference between admission and Day 1 ICU ferritin levels (611.5 ng/mL vs. 649 ng/mL respectively; P = .07). The decline in ferritin over ICU days 1-4 was similar between survivors and non-survivors. A change in ferritin levels from admission to ICU Day 1 (P = .330), or from ICU Day 1 to 2 (P = .788), did not predict days on the ventilator. Conclusions: Initial Ferritin levels were highly predictive of ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.

The injection procedures are performed either superficially or deeply with a needle or a cannula, and only one type of hyaluronic acid is used. The authors' objective was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and satisfaction level of a procedure combining two anatomical injection plans, two injection modes (i.e., cannula and needle), and two types of hyaluronic acid fillers.  Method:   The retrospective study included 30 patients who underwent the following procedure: Intramuscular retro-trace injections of Stylage M (Vivacy® Laboratories) were conducted through a 27-gauge cannula at the level of the upper and lower hemi-lip. Then, intradermal injections of Stylage Lips (Vivacy® Laboratories) using a 33-gauge needle were carried out on the entire lip border as well as the cupid's bow. During a post-injection follow-up, subjects were asked to evaluate satisfaction level and the effect of fillers over time. Elastic (G') and viscosity (G″) moduli of HA fillers were measured with a rheometer (AR2000, TA Instruments) prior to and after extrusion through a 33-gauge needle.  Results:   Rheological assessment showed that passage through a 33-gauge needle did not alter the viscoelastic properties of HA fillers. After the clinical procedure, no side effects were observed except for standard post-treatment bruises and edema. No vascular incident occurred. Moreover, overall patient satisfaction was high (2.6/3) and there was a long-lasting perception of the effect of the filler.  Conclusion:   The current study demonstrated that dissociating the anatomical zones of the lip during the injection procedure by means of different hyaluronic acids in the muscular and dermal planes would efficiently and safely provide both lip projection and fullness for a natural and lasting effect.""","""['Smarrito Stéphane', 'Smarrito-Menozzi Candice', 'Brunel Florence']""","""[' RIVIERAClinic, Vevey, Switzerland.', ' Laboratoire Vivacy, Archamps, France.']""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""J Cosmet Dermatol""","""['Clinical outcomes after lip injection procedures-Comparison of two hyaluronic acid gel fillers with different product properties.', 'Effectiveness and safety of hyaluronic acid fillers used to enhance overall lip fullness: A systematic review of clinical studies.', 'Four-point injection technique for lip augmentation.', 'Lip Augmentation With Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: A Review of Considerations and Techniques.', 'Lip Augmentation Using Hyaluronic Acid Filler and a 4-mm Needle: A Safer, More Natural, and Predictable Approach.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare survival outcomes between patients with poorly differentiated versus well-differentiated and moderately differentiated HPSCC. Patients with well/moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated HPSCC were matched based on age, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, comorbidity score, tumor stage, and therapeutic strategies.

In this article, we introduce our experience and strategy in treating spinal metastasis, focusing particularly on challenging cases. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 110 patients who underwent spinal surgery for metastatic spinal tumors from April 2018 to March 2020. Among them, 5 patients who received anterior approach surgery were excluded. The remaining 105 patients were enrolled. In addition to TS, we also performed cervical pedicle screw, cervicothoracic junction fixation, thoracolumbar short fixation, and decompression surgery, depending on the characteristics of the tumor. The overall survival was analyzed, and the local tumor control rate was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Perioperative clinical characteristics including Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire, visual analog scale, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, and Karnofsky Performance Score were also investigated. The overall survival rate was 57.9% at 1 year, and the local tumor control rate was 81.1% after surgery. There was a statistically significant difference according to the type of the tumor in the survival analysis: the overall survival rates were 72.7% for favorable tumors and 48.6% for unfavorable tumors at 12 months after surgery (P = .04). Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire, visual analog scale, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, and Karnofsky Performance Score was improved after surgery.

Interventions:   The patient underwent bilateral phacoemulsification. The IOL power was calculated using SRK/T formula for RK and Haigis-L formula for PRK, respectively. We finally selected the Haigis-L formula and the intraocular lens (SN60WF) was implanted within the capsular bag.  Outcomes:   After the surgery, both eyes showed myopia drift, and the right eye continuously fluctuated in refractive results. However, by nearly 1 year later, refractive results in both eyes had stabilized, and no other complications had occurred.  Lessons:   IOL power in patients who undergo both RK and PRK can be reliably calculated using the Shammas-PL, Average of multiple formulas, or Barret True-K No History formulas. Haigis-L formula is not suitable. Such patients require at least three months after surgery to attain refractive stability in both eyes.""","""['Tianxu Xiong', 'Jiancheng Mu', 'Hao Chen', 'Wei Fan']""","""[' Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jul""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Evaluation of total keratometry and its accuracy for intraocular lens power calculation in eyes after corneal refractive surgery.', 'Clinical and theoretical results of intraocular lens power calculation for cataract surgery after photorefractive keratectomy for myopia.', 'Pitfalls of IOL power prediction after photorefractive keratectomy for high myopia -- case report, practical recommendations and literature review.', 'Intraocular lens calculations status after corneal refractive surgery.', 'Intraocular Lens Power Calculations in Eyes with Previous Corneal Refractive Surgery: Review and Expert Opinion.']"""

Relapse of keloids is common after corticosteroid injection in patients with oily skin. To reduce side effects and keloid recurrence, we used a combination of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and hyaluronic acid (HA) as synergetic management for multiple sternal keloids in patients with oily skin.  Methods:   In total, 58 patients with multiple sternal keloids who received monthly steroid injections were retrospectively included. Thirty-two patients in the intervention group received an additional injection of BTX-A/HA on the same day as the first injection of the steroid, while the remaining 26 patients were treated as the control group. At baseline and follow-up visits, sebum production and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were assessed as primary outcomes, and the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) score, keloid recurrence, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and patient satisfaction were assessed as secondary outcomes.  Results:   In the control group, average sebum production and TEWL were increased to 132% and 104% of baseline, respectively, at the 24-week follow-up. In the intervention group, average sebum production and TEWL reached nadir at the 8-week follow-up and then increased to 96% and 91% of baseline, respectively, at the 24-week follow-up. Sternal keloid relapse was observed in 88.5% of the patients in the control group and none of the patients in the intervention group. The total VSS score at 24 weeks was 11.04 ± 0.14 and 8.93 ± 0.26 (p < 0.001) in the control group and intervention group, respectively, and the VAS score was 75 ± 5.10 and 19.14 ± 3.80 (p < 0.001) in the control group and intervention group, respectively. Higher patient satisfaction was reported in the intervention group.  Conclusions:   Microneedle delivery of BTX-A/HA decreases sebum production while improving skin barrier function.

However, no data exist concerning its potential benefit after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to evaluate a CRP-driven monitoring discharge strategy after laparoscopic IPAA for UC.  Methods:   Since 2012, 158 patients undergoing a laparoscopic IPAA for UC have been included: 66 patients (CRP group) operated since 2016 had a CRP-driven monitoring discharge on postoperative day 5 (POD 5) and were discharged on POD 6 if CRP < 100 mg/L; these patients were matched (according to age, gender, body mass index, IPAA in two or three steps) to 92 patients operated between 2012 and 2016 without any CRP monitoring (control group).  Results:   Median length of hospital stay was shorter in the CRP than the control group (7 vs. 9 days; P < 0.001) and discharge on POD 6 occurred more frequently in the CRP group (47% vs. 7%, P < 0.001).

Standard dosing often requires dose reduction because of side effects. There is no information on survival outcomes with lower doses. We investigated the impact of starting enzalutamide at ≤ 50% dose on metastatic prostate cancer outcomes including patients' longevity.  Patients and methods:   Records of metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with enzalutamide at one center were retrospectively reviewed. Low-dose enzalutamide (≤80 mg/day) was compared with standard-dose (160 mg/day). The primary objective was to compute the restricted mean survival time (RMST - time scale) and restricted mean attained age (RMAA - age scale) using the Irwin method. Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and PSA progression per PCWG3 criteria (PSA PFS). We used the logrank test and the ∆ difference between RMSTs for comparison.  Results:   Of 111 patients treated, 32 received a low-dose and 79 the standard-dose. Low-dose patients had less prior abiraterone or chemotherapy (28.1% vs. 65.8%, P < .001); more testosterone assessment (65.6% vs. 40.5%, P = .016); poorer ECOG performance status (48.3% score ≥2 vs. 26.6%; P = .040), more comorbidities (75.9% vs. 46.3%; P = .010)) including increased cardiovascular disease (51.7% vs. 21.4%, P = .004). Baseline PSA value and doubling time at start of enzalutamide and distribution of metastases were similar between the groups. OS and PFS did not differ between low-dose and standard-dose. Patients on low-dose had a better longevity with significantly longer RMAA, 89.1 years, versus standard-dose RMAA of 83.8 years (∆ = 5.3 years, P = .003, logrank P = .025). In a subgroup analysis by age at start of enzalutamide, <75 versus ≥75 years old, longevity was also better with low-dose in younger patients (∆ = 2.9 years, P = .034, and older, ∆ = 3.3 years, P = .011).

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as a precursor of glutathione, can reduce the production of reactive oxygen species to protect hair cells in the inner ear from damage. However, data regarding the therapeutic outcomes of oral steroid combined with oral NAC for ISSNHL are still limited. This study was performed to investigate this issue.  Methods:   Between June 2016 and October 2021, 219 patients (219 ears) diagnosed with ISSNHL and treated with oral prednisolone were enrolled in this retrospective study. Oral NAC was prescribed to 94 of these patients (NAC group) but not to the remaining 125 patients (non-NAC group). The clinical and audiological findings were assessed.  Results:   The NAC group showed a mean hearing level gain of 29.5 ± 21.8 dB, speech reception threshold (SRT) gain of 26.2 ± 34.4 dB, and speech discrimination score (SDS) gain of 25.5 ± 30.4%. Although the NAC group had better mean hearing level, SRT, and SDS gains than the non-NAC group, the differences were not statistically significant (all P > .05). The only significant difference between the NAC and non-NAC groups was the posttreatment pure tone audiometry (PTA) thresholds at 8 kHz, which were 54.2 ± 24.4 and 60.9 ± 34.1 dB, respectively (P = .046).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the effect of oral steroid combined with oral NAC for ISSNHL. Both the NAC and non-NAC groups showed obvious improvement in all PTA thresholds, as well as mean hearing level, SRT, and SDS gains. The NAC group showed significantly better PTA performance at a high frequency (8 kHz) than the non-NAC group.

The study aimed to investigate the presence of impulsiveness and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson disease patients with apathy symptoms. Eighty-one patients with Parkinson disease were enrolled in this retrospective study.

Design:   Retrospective, consecutive case series.  Subjects:   Consecutive patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) exhibiting de novo non-neovascular abnormalities within the deep vascular plexus (DCP), as detected using high-resolution (High-Res) spectral-domain (SD) and swept-source (SS) OCT or OCTA. Patients with retinal vascular alterations attributable to other disease entities were excluded.  Methods:   Complete ophthalmic examination and multimodal imaging, including confocal fundus photography (CFP), SD-OCT, High-Res SD-OCT and OCTA, and volume-averaged SS-OCTA. The volume renderings of High-Res OCTA and averaged SS-OCTA were used to analyze capillary abnormalities and inflow or outflow connectivity pathways.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcomes were the characteristics of capillary abnormalities (number, size, shape, reflectivity, and location) and inflow or outflow connectivity pathways. The secondary outcomes were nearby changes in CFP and structural OCT (hyperreflective foci [HRF], outer retinal atrophy, and retinal pigment epithelium [RPE] atrophy).  Results:   From 8 eyes of 8 patients, 2 subtypes of DRAMA were identified: small-diameter perifoveal capillary dilations with hyperreflective walls within the inner nuclear layer (type 1, n = 4) and vascular outpouchings, typically multiple, extending posteriorly into the Henle fiber layer, with reflectivity similar to adjacent normal retinal capillaries (type 2, n = 10). Four eyes had both subtypes of DRAMA. The 3-dimensional visualization of OCTA data demonstrated DRAMA corresponding to the dilations of DCP capillaries without direct inflow or outflow connections to the superficial plexus. Fundus photographs showed circular red dots in 3 eyes, all corresponding to type 1 DRAMA. In all the cases, DRAMA colocalized with HRF. No lesions were found anterior to the areas of the RPE or outer retina atrophy. Asymptomatic intraretinal exudation varied through a follow-up duration of up to 6 years, with no lesions progressing to type 3 MNV.  Conclusions:   In eyes with non-neovascular AMD, DRAMA include 2 types of capillary dilations occurring without the remodeling of the surrounding vascular network. Deep retinal age-related microvascular anomalies can resemble microvascular changes due to other causes and can masquerade as type 3 MNV. Mild intraretinal exudation can vary during follow-up, without progression to type 3 MNV.""","""['Diogo Cabral', 'Prithvi Ramtohul', 'Ana C Fradinho', 'K Bailey Freund']""","""[' Vitreous Retina Macula Consultants of New York, New York, New York; Nova Medical School Research, Nova Medical School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; Department of Ophthalmology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.', ' Vitreous Retina Macula Consultants of New York, New York, New York; Department of Ophthalmology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.', ' Nova Medical School Research, Nova Medical School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', ' Vitreous Retina Macula Consultants of New York, New York, New York; Department of Ophthalmology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.

Pure tone audiometry did not correlate to IAC extension, while speech discrimination scores were statistically worse when the tumor occupied the IAC (unpaired t test, p = 0.0152). Similarly, extrameatal tumors undergoing removal by otic preserving techniques maintained postoperative hearing, whereas hearing worsened significantly in tumors involving the IAC (paired t test, p = 0.048). The FN was affected preoperatively in 11.4% of cases. Postoperative FN palsy was significantly correlated to the IAC involvement (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.0013), while it was not correlated to tumor size. According to the Desgeorges classification, a postoperative FN palsy complicated the majority of anteriorly extending tumors and, two-fifths of meatus centred tumors. 75% of posterior located tumors had a postoperative FN grade I HB.  Conclusions:   Since the involvement of the IAC by the tumor affects both hearing and FN function, the IAC is of primary importance in PPSMs and should be studied and addressed as much as the tumor location in the CPA.""","""['Vittoria Sykopetrites', 'Abdelkader Taibah', 'Gianluca Piras', 'Anna Lisa Giannuzzi', 'Fernando Mancini', 'Mario Sanna']""","""[' Department of Otology and Skull Base Surgery, Gruppo Otologico and Mario Sanna Foundation, Piacenza, Rome, Italy. v.sykopetrites@gmail.com.', ' Casa di Cura ""Piacenza"" S.P.A., Via Emmanueli 42, 29121, Piacenza, Italy. v.sykopetrites@gmail.com.', ' Department of Otology and Skull Base Surgery, Gruppo Otologico and Mario Sanna Foundation, Piacenza, Rome, Italy.', ' Casa di Cura ""Piacenza"" S.P.A., Via Emmanueli 42, 29121, Piacenza, Italy.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol""","""['Posterior petrous bone meningiomas: surgical experience in 53 patients and literature review.', 'Posterior petrous meningiomas: 82 cases.', 'Transpetrosal approaches for meningiomas of the posterior aspect of the petrous bone Results in 43 consecutive patients.', 'Ventral petrous meningiomas: unique tumors.', 'Surgical management of jugular foramen meningiomas: a series of 13 cases and review of the literature.']"""

Methods:   Between 2008 and 2017, 102 patients with a solid renal mass ≥4 cm with no distant metastases underwent preliminary renal tumor biopsy. We investigated the proportion of patients who proceeded with radical nephrectomy, variables predicting non-renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and concordance between biopsy findings and definitive pathology.  Results:   Median tumor size was 70 mm (IQR 55-110). Clinical stage was cT1b in 41, cT2 in 33, cT3 in 25 and cT4 in three patients. A median of three (IQR 2-3) renal tumor biopsies were taken with 16/18 Gauge needles in 97% of cases. Clavien grade I complications occurred in five cases. Malignant tumors were documented in 84 patients: 78 RCCs and six non-RCCs. Fifteen biopsies documented oncocytoma and three were non-diagnostic. Grade was reported in 50 RCCs: 42 (84%) were low and eight (16%) high grade. Eighty-three patients proceeded with radical nephrectomy; six non-RCC malignant tumors underwent combined and/or intensified treatment; 13 of 15 patients with oncocytoma did not undergo radical nephrectomy (eight underwent observation). Definitive pathology confirmed diagnosis in all cases. Grade concordance was 84%, considering two tiers (high vs low grade). No preoperative clinical variable predicted definitive pathology.

We sought to determine guideline adherence and its relationship to hospital lobectomy volume within The Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database.  Methods:   Participant centers providing elective lobectomy for NSCLC within The Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database (2012-2019) were divided into tertiles according to annual volume. Average hospital nodal harvest of ≥10 nodes per lobectomy defined the primary outcome. Univariable analysis compared average patient and operative characteristics between the participant centers. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent factors associated with average clinical center nodal harvest of ≥10 nodes.  Results:   Median annual lobectomy volume was 6.2, 19.9, and 42.7 for low-, medium-, and high-volume participant centers. Among 305 centers and 43 597 patients, 5.6% of lobectomies occurred in low-volume centers, 24.0% in medium-volume centers, and 70.4% in high-volume centers. Average rates of ≥10 nodes per lobectomy were excised in 44.0% of low-volume centers, 70.6% of medium-volume centers, and 75.2% of high-volume centers (P < .001).

We herein present a novel salvage procedure when the TOL is not directly accessible by an LCE in conditions such as coexisting peritoneal carcinomatosis involving the colon. The salvage procedure, termed over-the-catheter endoscope replacement (OCER), starts with an ultraslim endoscope suitable for deep insertion beyond a tortuous colon for traversing a guidewire through the TOL. The ultraslim endoscope is then withdrawn and replaced by an LCE through the following steps. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography catheter is preloaded in the LCE, the catheter alone is passed over the guidewire already traversed through the TOL, and the LCE is navigated over the catheter as far as possible toward the TOL to deliver the SEMS delivery system in a standard through-the-scope manner or further in an over-the-wire manner even if LCE insertion is incomplete. Among the 165 patients with MCO who underwent stenting during our study period, OCER led to successful procedures in all nine patients whose TOLs were initially inaccessible because of colon-involving peritoneal carcinomatosis. By utilizing the functions of distinctive endoscopes in a unique and complementary way, OCER can be a practical salvage option for challenging cases of MCO that are highly prone to unsuccessful palliation by conventional SEMS placement.""","""['Yoichiro Iboshi', 'Yorinobu Sumida', 'Eikichi Ihara', 'Hiroyuki Fujii', 'Naohiko Harada', 'Makoto Nakamuta', 'Yoshihiro Ogawa']""","""[' Department of Gastroenterology, Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', ' Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', ' Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, National Hospital Organization Fukuokahigashi Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Dig Endosc""","""['Challenges in colonic stenting: Giving up is not an option.', 'Is a small-caliber or large-caliber endoscope more suitable for colonic self-expandable metallic stent placement?

Methods:   A dataset of 402 malignant and 257 benign lesions was identified. Two radiologists assigned the KS. If a lesion with KS > 4 had ADC > 1.4 × 10-3 mm2/s, the KS was reduced by 4 to become KS+. In order to consider the full spectrum of ADC as a continuous variable, the KS and ADC values were used to train diagnostic models using 5 ML algorithms. The performance was evaluated using the ROC analysis, compared by the DeLong test. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy achieved using the threshold of KS > 4, KS+ > 4, and ADC ≤ 1.4 × 10-3 mm2/s were obtained and compared by the McNemar test.  Results:   The ROC curves of KS, KS+, and all ML models had comparable AUC in the range of 0.883-0.921, significantly higher than that of ADC (0.837, p < 0.0001). The KS had sensitivity = 97.3% and specificity = 59.1%; and the KS+ had sensitivity = 95.5% with significantly improved specificity to 68.5% (p < 0.0001). However, when setting at the same sensitivity of 97.3%, KS+ could not improve specificity. In ML analysis, the logistic regression model had the best performance. At sensitivity = 97.3% and specificity = 65.3%, i.e., compared to KS, 16 false-positives may be avoided without affecting true cancer diagnosis (p = 0.0015).  Conclusion:   Using dichotomized ADC to modify KS to KS+ can improve specificity, but at the price of lowered sensitivity. Machine learning algorithms may be applied to consider the ADC as a continuous variable to build more accurate diagnostic models.  Key points:   • When using ADC to modify the Kaiser score to KS+, the diagnostic specificity according to the results of two independent readers was improved by 9.4-9.7%, at the price of slightly degraded sensitivity by 1.5-1.8%, and overall had improved accuracy by 2.6-2.9%. • When the KS and the continuous ADC values were combined to train models by machine learning algorithms, the diagnostic specificity achieved by the logistic regression model could be significantly improved from 59.1 to 65.3% (p = 0.0015), while maintaining at the high sensitivity of KS = 97.3%, and thus, the results demonstrated the potential of ML modeling to further evaluate the contribution of ADC. • When setting the sensitivity at the same levels, the modified KS+ and the original KS have comparable specificity; therefore, KS+ with consideration of ADC may not offer much practical help, and the original KS without ADC remains as an excellent robust diagnostic method.""","""['Zhong-Wei Chen', 'You-Fan Zhao', 'Hui-Ru Liu', 'Jie-Jie Zhou', 'Hai-Wei Miao', 'Shu-Xin Ye', 'Yun He', 'Xin-Miao Liu', 'Min-Ying Su', 'Mei-Hao Wang']""","""["" Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ' Department of Radiological Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA. msu@uci.edu.', ' Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. msu@uci.edu.', "" Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. wzwmh@wmu.edu.cn.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Oct""","""Eur Radiol""","""['A Multicentric Comparison of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Mapping and the Kaiser Score in the Assessment of Breast Lesions.', 'Can DWI provide additional value to Kaiser score in evaluation of breast lesions.', 'Mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Is a Sufficient Conventional Diffusion-weighted MRI Metric to Improve Breast MRI Diagnostic Performance: Results from the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group A6702 Diffusion Imaging Trial.', 'A Comparative Assessment of MR BI-RADS 4 Breast Lesions With Kaiser Score and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Value.', 'Accuracy of quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Combination of ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI-based radiomics and artificial neural network in assessing BI-RADS 4 breast lesions: Potential to avoid unnecessary biopsies.']"""

In children, treatment of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia usually consists of postoperative calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation. In 2013, we implemented prophylactic pre-thyroidectomy calcitriol supplementation for all children undergoing total thyroidectomy at the Amsterdam UMC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this prophylactic calcitriol supplementation in preventing post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia in children.  Methods:   In a retrospective case study, we included all children (age <18 years), who underwent a total or completion thyroidectomy in the Amsterdam UMC, between 2000 and 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, patients with preoperative calcitriol supplementation and those without (controls). Hypocalcaemia was defined as total serum calcium concentration of <2.0 mmol/L. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of hypocalcaemia in the first 72 h after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were occurrence of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, need for medical intervention within the first 72 h after surgery, and length of hospitalization.  Results:   A total of 51 patients were included; 26 with calcitriol prophylaxis and 25 controls. There was no significant difference in occurrence of hypocalcaemia (17/26 prophylaxis group; 18/25 control group). Median postoperative calcium concentrations in the first 72 h were significantly higher in the group with prophylaxis at 30-35 h (2.26 vs. 2.01 mmol/L) and 36-41 h (2.17 vs. 1.92 mmol/L). Occurrence of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, need for medical intervention, and length of hospitalization were not significantly different between the groups.

In addition, the efficacy of dasatinib in the treatment of patients with advanced CML was then retrospectively analyzed. The results showed that the IEAS system could incorporate the gene expression analysis vectors it contained by JAVA-related technologies, and the generated clustering genes showed similar functions. The clustering algorithm could homogenize data and generate visual clustering heat maps. The analysis results of major elements were diverse under different experimental conditions. The characteristic value of the first major element was the largest. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) datasets of CML patients were selected from cancer genomic map, including 120 samples and 20,614 mRNA in total. In micro-RNA (miRNA) datasets, there were 202 samples including 1,406 miRNAs. Data were screened by miRNA-mRNA regulation template, and 20 differentially expressed mRNAs were obtained. In conclusion, the proposed IEAS system could mine and analyze the gene expression data. Dasatinib showed good efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced CML.

The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between traditionally used Lund-Mackay CT score and ACCESS score and their possible relationship to pre- and postoperative quality of life in a narrowly defined group of patients with recurrent CRSwNP.  Methods:   Forty-nine patients who underwent a revision ESS for CRSwNP were enrolled in a retrospective study. CT imaging scans were evaluated, LM and ACCESS scores determined. All patients completed the validated Czech version of the SNOT-22 questionnaire before and 6 months after surgery. The correlation between the two CT scores and the QoL questionnaire was tested using Pearson's correlation tests.  Results:   No correlation was demonstrated between LM scores and patient-based SNOT-22 scores neither preopratively nor postoperatively (r = - 0.0580; p = 0.918 and r = 0.0252; p = 0.8634, respectively.

No linear relationship was demonstrated between the LM score and the ACCESS score (r = 0.075; p = 0.6053).  Conclusions:   The results show that even the CT score evaluating the completeness of previous procedures has no linear relationship to the quality of life preoperatively and cannot serve as a predictor for the outcomes of surgical treatment.

The invasion depth is closely related to the selection of treatment strategy. However, diagnosis of IPCLs is complicated and subject to interobserver variability. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict IPCLs subtypes of precancerous lesions and superficial ESCC.  Methods:   Images of magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging from three hospitals were collected retrospectively. IPCLs subtypes were annotated on images by expert endoscopists according to Japanese Endoscopic Society classification. The performance of the AI system was evaluated using internal and external validation datasets (IVD and EVD) and compared with that of the 11 endoscopists.  Results:   A total of 7094 images from 685 patients were used to train and validate the AI system. The combined accuracy of the AI system for diagnosing IPCLs subtypes in IVD and EVD was 91.3% and 89.8%, respectively. The AI system achieved better performance than endoscopists in predicting IPCLs subtypes and invasion depth. The ability of junior endoscopists to diagnose IPCLs subtypes (combined accuracy: 84.7% vs 78.2%, P < 0.0001) and invasion depth (combined accuracy: 74.4% vs 67.9%, P < 0.0001) were significantly improved with AI system assistance.

Methods and results:   The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 10-year follow-up. Patients were stratified by diabetes status (non-DM and DM) and grafting strategy (MAG vs. SAG). A total of 3020 patients were included in the analysis; 716 (23.7%) had DM. Overall, 55.8% non-DM patients received MAG and 44.2% received SAG, while 56.6% DM patients received MAG and 43.4% received SAG. The use of MAG compared with SAG was associated with lower 10-year mortality for both non-DM [17.7 vs. 21.0%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.06] and DM patients (21.5 vs. 29.9%, adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.89; P for interaction = 0.12). For both groups, the rate of 10-year MACE was also lower for MAG vs. SAG. Overall, deep sternal wound infections (DSWIs) were uncommon but more frequent in the MAG vs. SAG group in both non-DM (3.3 vs. 2.1%) and DM patients (7.9 vs. 4.8%). The highest rates of DSWI were in insulin-treated patients receiving MAG (9.6 vs. 6.3%, when compared with SAG).

Then, single-incision LTBDE (SILTBDE) was adopted as a preferred technique since August 2013. This retrospective study aims to analyze the outcome of LTBDE in 7.7 years and to compare SILTBDE with four-incision LTBDE (4ILTBDE).  Methods:   Seventeen consecutive patients underwent LTBDE for MS McSherry type II from September 2011 to May 2019. Transfistulous removal of the impacted stone(s), choledochoscopic bile duct exploration, and primary closure of the gallbladder remnant were performed without biliary drainage.  Results:   The sex ratio is 12:5 (male: female) with an average age of 39.4 ± 10.3 (24-56) years. Ten patients (58.8%) had their diagnoses of MS established by preoperative imaging. According to the Csendes classification, three type II (17.6%), nine type III (52.9%), and five type IV (29.4%) were identified. The operative time was 264.8 ± 60.3 min (156-358 min). The stone clearance rate was 100%. The postoperative hospital stay was 4.7 ± 1.9 (2-10) days. No procedure was converted to an open operation. Two postoperative transient hyperamylasemia (11.8%) and one superficial wound infection (5.9%) occurred and all recovered well under conservative treatment (Clavien-Dindo grade I). During an average 2.2-year follow-up period, no biliary stricture or stone recurrence occurred. No significant difference exists between the SILTBDE and 4ILTBDE groups. Nevertheless, an insignificant trend of shorter postoperative hospital stay was observed in the former. A diagnosis of MS Csendes type IV implicates prolonged total and postoperative hospital stays (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   LTBDE is safe and efficacious for MS McSherry type II. It provides a simple solution for various types of MS and avoids undesirable complications following bilioenteric anastomosis. SILTBDE is comparable to 4ILTBDE for selected patients.

We aimed to compare the intraoperative and postoperative short-term outcomes of spleen-preserving splenic hilar lymphadenectomy (SPSHL) during robotic and laparoscopic total gastrectomy.  Methods:   From July 2016 to December 2020, the clinicopathological data of 115 patients who underwent robotic total gastrectomy combined with robotic SPSHL (RSPSHL) and 697 patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy combined with laparoscopic SPSHL (LSPSHL) were retrospectively analyzed. A 1:2 ratio propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the differences between the two groups to compare their outcomes. The Generic Error Rating Tool was used to evaluate the technical performance.  Results:   After PSM, the baseline preoperative characteristics of the 115 patients in the RSPSHL and 230 patients in the LSPSHL groups were balanced. The dissection time of the region of the splenic artery trunk (5.4 ± 1.9 min vs. 7.8 ± 3.6 min, P < 0.001), the estimated blood loss during SPSHL (9.6 ± 4.8 ml vs. 14.9 ± 7.8 ml, P < 0.001), and the average number of intraoperative technical errors during SPSHL (15.1 ± 3.4 times/case vs. 20.7 ± 4.3 times/case, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the RSPSHL group than in the LSPSHL group. The RSPSHL group showed higher dissection rates of No. 10 (78.3% vs. 70.0%, P = 0.104) and No. 11d (54.8% vs. 40.4%, P = 0.012) lymph nodes and significantly improved postoperative recovery results in terms of times to ambulation, first flatus, and first intake (P < 0.05). The splenectomy rates of the two groups were similar (1.7% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.539), and there was no significant difference in morbidity and mortality within postoperative 30 days (13.0% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.589).

Doppler monitoring systems which can evaluate vascular flow have been recently introduced in the endoscopic field. We developed the Doppler probe method (DOP) using the novel system and conducted a comparative study.  Methods:   Data were retrospectively collected at a tertiary hospital between January 2017 and May 2021. Patients who underwent DOP were matched to those who did not (no-DOP, 1:3 ratio). After successful ESD, DOP was performed, and coagulation was additionally performed as necessary. The primary outcome was the rate of 30-day delayed bleeding.  Results:   Fifty DOP patients were matched to 151 no-DOP patients. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the DOP group had lower rates of delayed bleeding (2.0% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.11; risk differences, 6.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-12.1%), readmission due to bleeding (0% vs. 2.7%), and blood transfusion (2.0% vs. 3.3%) compared to the no-DOP group. In the whole study population (n = 245), the log-rank test revealed that DOP was correlated to a lower incidence of delayed bleeding (P = 0.036). The Cox regression model revealed a marginally significant effect on delayed bleeding (hazard ratio = 0.17, 95% CI 0.022-1.26, P = 0.082). No procedure-related adverse events were observed.

However, there remain concerns regarding the higher risks of infective complications and antibody-mediated rejections. The aim of our study is to show longer-term follow-up on all ABOi and HLAi paediatric kidney transplant recipients (pKTR) in the UK.  Methods:   Questionnaires specifying kidney transplant type, desensitisation requirement and kidney allograft function were sent to 13 paediatric nephrology centres that performed kidney transplantation in children and young people under 18 years of age who received an ABOi and/or HLAi transplant between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2016. Patient and kidney allograft survival were compared between ABOi, HLAi and ABO/HLA compatible (ABOc/HLAc) groups.  Results:   Among 711 living donor kidney transplants performed in the UK, 23 were ABOi and 6 were HLAi. Patient survival was 87%, 100% and 96% in ABOi, HLAi and ABOc/HLAc groups, respectively, at median follow-up of 6.8 (3.6-14.0) years post-transplant. Death-censored kidney allograft survival was 100% in all 3 groups at last follow-up. There were no cases of primary non-function in ABOi or HLAi groups, but 2% in the ABOc/HLAc group. There was one reported case of Epstein-Barr viral-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  Conclusion:   Longer term follow-up has shown that ABOi and HLAi kidney transplantation are feasible for pKTR where no compatible donors are available, and that minimising desensitisation should be achieved where possible.

Patients were administered the following treatment regimen: 20 mg/d avatrombopag; if the PLT count was less than 50×10^9/L for at least 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 40 mg/d; if the PLT count was 200-400×10^9/L, the dose was reduced; and if the PLT count was greater than 400×10^9/L, avatrombopag was terminated. Umbilical cord MSCs (1×10^6 cells/kg) infusion was performed every week for 4-6 weeks. Among the 16 patients, 13 patients (81.3%) achieved a complete response (CR), 2 patients (12.5%) got a partial response (PR), and 1 patient (6.3%) had no response (NR). The median time to obtain CR was 32 (7-426) days after treatment with avatrombopag combined with umbilical cord MSCs. The time to reach 20×10^9/L≤ PLT <50×10^9/L in the 2 patients with PR was 52 and 230 days after treatment, respectively. One patient had a severe pulmonary infection and died of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Overall, our results indicated that combination of avatrombopag with MSCs can promote platelet recovery after transplantation, thereby improving the survival rate of patients and improving the quality of life of patients after transplantation, and providing a new method and strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia after allo-HSCT.""","""['Lidan Zhu', 'Jia Liu', 'Peiyan Kong', 'Shichun Gao', 'Lu Wang', 'Huanfeng Liu', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Li Gao', 'Yimei Feng', 'Ting Chen', 'Lei Gao', 'Xi Zhang']""","""[' Medical Center of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 May""","""Front Immunol""","""[""Avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in children's patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: A pilot study."", 'Pre-transplant thrombocytopenia predicts engraftment time and blood products requirement in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.', 'Phase II study of avatrombopag in thrombocytopenic patients with cirrhosis undergoing an elective procedure.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells versus mesenchymal stem cells combined with cord blood for engraftment failure after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a pilot prospective, open-label, randomized trial.', 'Clinical study of mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors in the treatment of refractory late onset hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanation.', ""Avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in children's patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: A pilot study."", 'Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells as treatment for poor graft function after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: A multicenter prospective analysis.']"""

To date, the risk factors for adverse events (AEs) and long-term outcomes of EUS-HGS have not been fully explored according to stent type. Therefore, we evaluated potential risk factors for AEs and long-term outcomes of EUS-HGS.  Methods:   In total, 120 patients who underwent EUS-HGS were retrospectively reviewed. A multivariate analysis through Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression model was used to identify the risk factors for stent dysfunction and AEs, respectively. Stent patency and patient survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plots with a log-rank test for each stent.  Results:   The technical and clinical success rates were 96.2% (102/106) and 83.0% (88/106). The median duration of stent patency was longer in self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) compared to plastic stents (PS) (158 vs. 108 days). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the type of stent was not associated with stent patency (Hazard ratios [HR] 0.997, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.525-1.896]) or overall survival. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that hilar MBO significantly associated with stent dysfunction (HR, 2.340; 95% CI, 1.028-5.326, p = 0.043) and late AEs.  Conclusions:   Given the lower incidence of AEs and better long-term outcomes of EUS-HGS, it can be considered a safe alternative to ERCP or percutaneous approaches regardless of which stent is used.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 58 patients with a postoperative pathologically confirmed AMLmf (observation group) and 140 patients with other common renal tumors (control group). Non-contrast-enhanced CT and contrast-enhanced CT data were evaluated. Radiomics features were extracted from manually delineated volume of interest (VOIs). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for feature screening. Five classifiers, including logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and logistic regression (LR), were used, with leave-out validation (128 training, 60 testing).

Sense of smell was scored as judged by the patient using scores 0 to 3 reflecting a percentage estimate of remaining smell.  Results:   Smell improved similarly in the Reboot and ESS groups over the first 9 months, which was maintained over 24 months in the Reboot, but not the ESS group (p = 0.007 after 18 months, p = 0.001 after 24 months). Furthermore, polyp recurrence rates were significantly lower in the Reboot group.

Methods:   From June 2019 to July 2020, 263 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunostomy at Samsung Medical Center. The individual fistula risk scores were calculated using a previously developed nomogram. The clinicopathological data of the patients were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   There were 81 patients in the low-risk group and 182 patients in the high-risk group. No statistically significant differences were found in the rates of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula between octreotide group and the control group in all patients (15.0% vs 14.7%, P = .963) and in the high-risk group (16.1% vs 23.6%, P = .206). In risk factor analysis, postoperative octreotide was not an independent risk factor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula in all patients and the high-risk group. Drain fluid amylase levels on the first postoperative day were significantly associated with clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, regardless of the individual risk.

Patients answered a structured questionnaire about their olfactory symptoms, with specific questions related to the presence of OF and its average frequency, amplitude, duration, time since most recent OF, and associated symptoms of self-reported OF. Patients also underwent clinical evaluation including a structured medical history and physical examination including nasal endoscopy.

Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength.  Hypothesis:   We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy.  Materials and methods:   Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases).  Results:   The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer.  Discussion:   Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective.

We explored the value of skull base invasion (SBI) subclassification in prognostic stratification and use of induction chemotherapy (IC) to optimize T2/T3 categorization for NPC patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 1752 NPC patients from two hospitals. Eight skull base bone structures were evaluated. Survival differences were compared between slight SBI (T3 patients with pterygoid process and/or base of the sphenoid bone invasion only) and severe SBI (T3 patients with other SBIs) with or without IC using random matched-pair analysis. We calculated the prognosis and Harrel concordance index (C-index) for the revised T category and compared IC outcomes for the revised tumor stages.  Results:   Compared to severe SBI, slight SBI showed better 5-year overall survival (OS) (81.5% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (71.5% vs. 83.0%, p = 0.002). Additional IC therapy did not significantly improve OS and PFS in slight SBI. The proposed T category separated OS, PFS, and locoregional recurrence-free survival in T2 and T3 categories with statistical significance. An improved C-index for OS prediction was observed in the proposed T category with combined confounding factors, compared to the AJCC T staging system (0.725 vs. 0.713, p = 0.046). The survival benefits of IC were more obvious in the advanced stage.  Conclusions:   NPC patients with slight SBI were recommended to downstage to T2 category. The adjustment for T category enabled better prognostic stratification and guidance for IC use.  Key points:   • For nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients in T3 category, slight skull base invasion was a significant positive predictor for OS and PFS. • NPC patients with slight SBI might not gain significant survival benefits from induction chemotherapy. • Downstaging slight SBI NPC patients to T2 category would make a more accurate risk stratification, improve the predicting performance in OS, and have a better guidance in the use of IC for patients in advanced stage.""","""['Shuqi Li#', 'Chao Luo#', 'Wenjie Huang', 'Siyu Zhu', 'Guangying Ruan', 'Lizhi Liu', 'Haojiang Li']""","""["" Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diagnosis and Therapy, 651 Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", "" Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diagnosis and Therapy, 651 Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China. liulizh@sysucc.org.cn."", "" Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diagnosis and Therapy, 651 Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China. lihaoj@sysucc.org.cn.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Subclassification of skull-base invasion for nasopharyngeal carcinoma using cluster, network and survival analyses: A double-center retrospective investigation.', 'Nodal grouping in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: prognostic significance, N classification, and a marker for the identification of candidates for induction chemotherapy.', 'Extent of paranasal sinus involvement and its prognostic value in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Proposed modification in the current UICC/AJCC staging system.', 'Prognostic Value and Grading of MRI-Based T Category in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Without Lymph Node Metastasis Undergoing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy.', 'Staging of T2 and T3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Proposed modifications for improving the current AJCC staging system.', 'Synergistic Association of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and Plasma Epstein-Barr Virus DNA Load on Distant Metastasis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Feasibility evaluation of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging in the diagnosis of skull-base invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.']"""

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising, but their trade-offs between sensitivity and precision frequently lead to missing small lesions.  Hypothesis:   Combining volume aware (VA) loss function and sampling strategy could improve BM detection sensitivity.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 530 radiation oncology patients (55% women) were split into a training/validation set (433 patients/1460 BM) and an independent test set (97 patients/296 BM).  Field strength/sequence:   1.5 T and 3 T, contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted fast gradient echo sequences.  Assessment:   Ground truth masks were based on radiotherapy treatment planning contours reviewed by experts. A U-Net inspired model was trained. Three loss functions (Dice, Dice + boundary, and VA) and two sampling methods (label and VA) were compared. Results were reported with Dice scores, volumetric error, lesion detection sensitivity, and precision. A detected voxel within the ground truth constituted a true positive.  Statistical tests:   McNemar's exact test to compare detected lesions between models. Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis to compare volume agreement between predicted and ground truth volumes. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.  Results:   Combining VA loss and VA sampling performed best with an overall sensitivity of 91% and precision of 81%. For BM in the 2.5-6 mm estimated sphere diameter range, VA loss reduced false negatives by 58% and VA sampling reduced it further by 30%. In the same range, the boundary loss achieved the highest precision at 81%, but a low sensitivity (24%) and a 31% Dice loss.  Data conclusion:   Considering BM size in the loss and sampling function of CNN may increase the detection sensitivity regarding small BM. Our pipeline relying on a single contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI sequence could reach a detection sensitivity of 91%, with an average of only 0.66 false positives per scan.

We used smartphone-based real-time assessments in 731 participants for 7 days and investigated how individuals' self-reported stress and mood fluctuated diurnally during lockdown in spring 2020. We found that age, gender, financial security, depressive symptoms and trait loneliness modulated the diurnal dynamics of participants' momentary stress and mood. For example, younger and less financially secure individuals showed an attenuated decline in stress as the day progressed, and similarly, more lonely individuals showed a diminished increase in calmness throughout the day.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients referred to the CCS from July 13, 2020, to March 05, 2021. We used descriptive statistics to report on the patient population and service metrics.  Results:   During the 34-week period, 96 patients accessed the CCS (median age, 61 years). The top reasons for CCS consultation were management of cancer pain, insomnia, and general interest. Medical cannabis was supported as an option in 44/96 patients. Reasons for not supporting PDC use included lack of indication, potential drug interaction/contraindication, or requiring treatment with first-line therapy. Of the 40 patients requiring a medical document, 22 initiated therapy. The most common product used was a 2:50 THC:CBD (Tetrahydrocannabinol:Cannabidiol) cannabis oil. At the date of last contact, few patients remained on therapy because of lack of benefit, patient choice, and/or hesitancy.  Conclusion:   Despite patients with cancer having interest in seeking PDCs for symptom management, only a few initiated and continued therapy.

Finally, decision analysis and clinical impact curve were used to determine the optimal decision point.Twenty-five (14.7%) of the 170 patients with pT1 ESCC exhibited LNM. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that smoking, carcinoembryonic antigen, vascular tumor thromboembolus, and tumor differentiation degree were independent risk factors for LNM.

The rate of HD was significantly higher in the MACE group (19% vs 6%, P < .01). In non-HD patients, the eGFR was significantly lower in the MACE group (51.2 vs 63.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .01). Overall, univariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between HD and MACE (HR 2.91, P = .01), as did the multivariate model (HR 2.90, P = .01). Of the MACE, more deaths occurred in HD patients (15.8% vs 2.9%, P = .03). Among non-HD patients, eGFR <45 (HR 2.70, P = .02), FFR (per 0.01, HR 0.87, P < .01), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (per 10 mg/dL, HR 1.17, P = .02) were independent predictors of MACE. Any revascularization was more common in patients with eGFR<45 than in those with eGFR ≥45 (21.4% vs 7.3%, P = .02). Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that the HD group showed a significantly lower MACE-free survival rate than the nonHD group (log-rank P < .01). In non-HD patients, the eGFR<45 group showed a lower MACE-free survival rate than the eGFR ≥45 group (log-rank P = .01).HD and reduced eGFR in non-HD patients were associated with adverse cardiac events after FFR-guided deferral of revascularization.""","""['Masashi Yokoi', 'Tsuyoshi Ito', 'Takafumi Nakayama', 'Hiroshi Fujita', 'Tomonori Sugiura', 'Yoshihiro Seo']""","""[' Department of Cardiology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 May""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Impact of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein on clinical outcomes after fractional flow reserve-guided deferral of revascularization.', 'Long-term outcomes of intermediate coronary stenosis in patients undergoing hemodialysis after deferred revascularization based on fractional flow reserve.', 'Comparison of Major Adverse Cardiac Events Between Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio and Fractional Flow Reserve-Guided Strategy in Patients With or Without Type 2 Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Clinical Events After Deferral of LAD\xa0Revascularization Following Physiological\xa0Coronary\xa0Assessment.', 'Safety of the Deferral of Coronary Revascularization on the Basis of Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio and Fractional Flow Reserve Measurements in Stable Coronary Artery Disease and Acute Coronary Syndromes.']"""

When fever occurs postoperatively in patients, surgeons are eager to rule out an infection. There are many reports about postoperative fever and infection; however, only a few have described the relationship between degenerative spinal disease and postoperative fever. This study aimed to investigate the causes of postoperative fever in patients with degenerative lumbar disease undergoing posterior screw fixation and interbody fusion and compare patients with non-pathologic fever and infected febrile patients.  Methods:   From March 2015 to February 2016, 263 patients with degenerative lumbar disease underwent posterior lumbar screw fixation and interbody fusion surgery in our institution. We performed risk factor analysis by categorizing patients as afebrile and febrile. Comparisons were made between afebrile patients and patients with non-pathologic fever, and an analysis was performed between patients with non-pathologic fever and patients with febrile infection. We compared each group by examining the demographic factors before surgery, surgery features, drain duration, and postoperative transfusion. The postoperative day (POD) of fever onset, postoperative fever duration, and blood sample results in patients with fever were investigated.  Results:   The drain duration was found to be an important factor between the afebrile febrile groups and between the non-pathologic fever and afebrile groups. POD of fever occurred earlier in the non-pathologic group than in the infection group (p = 0.04), and the duration of fever was shorter in the non-pathologic fever group than in the infection group (p = 0.01). Higher procalcitonin levels were observed at POD 5 in the infection group than in the non-pathologic fever group. (p < 0.01) The accidental dural rupture rate was higher in the infected group (p = 0.02); this was thought to be caused by the long non-ambulatory period after surgery.  Conclusion:   This study identified risk factors and differences between infectious diseases associated with postoperative fever. A significant risk factor for postoperative non-pathological fever was a shorter catheter drainage period. Fever after 3 days, fever for more than 4 days and higher procalcitonin levels after surgery suggest infection.""","""['Jung Jae Lee', 'Jeong Hee Kim', 'Ju Hee Jeon', 'Myeong Jong Kim', 'Byong Gon Park', 'Sang Ku Jung', 'Sang Ryong Jeon', 'Sung Woo Roh', 'Jin Hoon Park']""","""[' Department of Neurosurgery, Gangneung Asan Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Gangneung, Korea.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Seongnam Citizens Medical Center, Seongnam, Korea.', ' Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do 270-701, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Emergency Medicine, Gangneung Asan Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Gangneung, Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 May""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Comparison of open and minimally invasive techniques for posterior lumbar instrumentation and fusion after open anterior lumbar interbody fusion.', 'Posterior lumbar interbody fusion with cortical bone trajectory screw fixation versus posterior lumbar interbody fusion using traditional pedicle screw fixation for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: a comparative study.', 'Unilateral pedicle screw fixation versus its combination with contralateral translaminar facet screw fixation for the treatment of single segmental lower lumbar vertebra diseases.', 'Hybrid circumferential fixation for degenerative lumbosacral spine disease: posterior lumbar interbody fusion plus universal clamp rod-band instrumentation: a novel technique for lumbosacral fixation.', 'Effects of posterior lumbar nonfusion surgery with isobar devices versus posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery on clinical and radiological features in patients with lumbar degenerative diseases: a meta-analysis.', 'A Randomized Study on the Prophylactic Use of Acetaminophen to Prevent Fever after the Removal of Drainage Tubes for Lumbar Surgery.']"""

Whether endoscopic resection (ER) for GTC is safe and suitable and guidelines for treatment and follow-up remains unclear.  Methods:   Patients with GTC who underwent ER at Kanagawa Cancer Center Hospital between 1997 and 2020 were studied retrospectively to evaluate clinical characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes.  Results:   Twenty-two consecutive patients with 43 lesions were treated in 42 sessions of ER. Lesions were discovered at a median of 9.0 (0-21.8) years after esophageal surgery. Nine (40.9%) patients had multiple lesions at the time of the initial ER session. However, six (54.5%) of the 11 co-existing lesions were overlooked. The location of the middle third was an estimated risk factor for overlooking (p = 0.028). In endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) cases, the en bloc dissection rate was as high as 97.1%, and the rates of bleeding, perforation, and aspiration pneumonitis were 17.6%, 0%, and 2.9%, respectively. The bleeding rate was relatively higher than that in usual gastric ESD. Twelve patients (54.5%) experienced synchronous and/or metachronous multiple GTCs during their life span. Thirteen (61.9%) patients died during the median follow-up period of 5.9 (0.7-15.5) years. One patient (7.7%) died of GTC recurrence, 15.4 years after the initial non-curative ER date; 3 (23.1%) patients died of esophageal cancer recurrence, and 3 (23.1%) died of other organ malignancies. The 5-year overall survival rate was 85.0%, and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 100%.  Conclusions:   ER is feasible for GTCs. However, the rate of bleeding was high in ESD cases. Life-long endoscopic screening of metachronous lesions is desirable. Care should be taken not to overlook lesions in the middle third of the gastric tube.

DLR was compared with filtered back projection (FBP), statistical-based iterative reconstruction (SBIR), model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) Cardiac, and MBIR Cardiac sharp for objective image qualities of coronary CTA. Invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) and quantitative flow ratio (QFR) were used as the reference standards.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 83 patients with suspected NMD who underwent multiparametric MRI at 3 T with a subsequent muscle biopsy between 2015 and 2019. Qualitative T1-weighted and T2-TIRM images were graded by two neuroradiologists to be either pathological or normal. Mean and median water T2 relaxation times (water T2) were obtained from manually drawn volumes of interests in biopsied muscle from multi-echo sequence. Histopathologic pattern of corresponding muscle biopsies was used as a reference.  Results:   In 34 patients, the T1-weighted images showed clear pathological alternations indicating late-stage fatty infiltration in NMDs. In the remaining 49 patients without late-stage changes, T2-TIRM grading achieved a sensitivity of 56.4%, and mean and median water T2 a sensitivity of 87.2% and 97.4% to detect early-stage NMDs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.682, 0.715, and 0.803 for T2-TIRM, mean water T2, and median water T2, respectively. Median water T2 ranged between 36 and 42 ms depending on histopathologic pattern.  Conclusions:   Quantitative water T2 relaxometry had a significantly higher sensitivity in detecting muscle abnormalities than subjective grading of T2-TIRM, prior to late-stage fatty infiltration signal alternations in T1-weighted images. Normal-appearing T2-TIRM does not rule out early-stage NMDs. Our findings suggest considering water T2 relaxometry complementary to T2-TIRM for early detection of NMDs in clinical diagnostic routine.  Key points:   • Quantitative water T2 relaxometry is more sensitive than subjective assessment of fat-suppressed T2-weighted images for the early detection of neuromuscular diseases, prior to late-stage fatty infiltration signal alternations in T1-weighted images. • Normal-appearing muscles in fat-suppressed T2-weighted images do not rule out early-stage neuromuscular diseases. • Quantitative water T2 relaxometry should be considered complementary to subjectively rated fat-suppressed T2-weighted images in clinical practice.""","""['Noah Locher', 'Benedikt Wagner', 'Fabian Balsiger', 'Olivier Scheidegger']""","""[' Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ' Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging (SCAN), Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ' Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. olivier.scheidegger@insel.ch.', ' Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging (SCAN), Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. olivier.scheidegger@insel.ch.', ' Universitätsklinik für Neurologie, Inselspital, Freiburgstrasse, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland. olivier.scheidegger@insel.ch.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Water-Fat Separation in MR Fingerprinting for Quantitative Monitoring of the Skeletal Muscle in Neuromuscular Disorders.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Comparison of turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) with T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and T1-weighted spin-echo MR imaging in the early diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis in children.', 'T2-Weighted Dixon Turbo Spin Echo for Accelerated Simultaneous Grading of Whole-Body Skeletal Muscle Fat Infiltration and Edema in Patients With Neuromuscular Diseases.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Radiomics and machine learning applied to STIR sequence for prediction of quantitative parameters in facioscapulohumeral disease.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 90 consecutive patients who underwent CTV and ECV. Manually placed region-of-interest ECV (manual-ECV), rigid-registration ECV (rigid-ECV), and nonrigid-registration ECV (nonrigid-ECV) were calculated as ECV(%) = (1-haematocrit) × (ΔHUliver/ΔHUaorta), where ΔHU = subtraction of unenhanced phase from equilibrium phase (240 s). Manual-ECV was compared with CTV for the estimation of LF. The total liver volume to body surface area (TLV/BSA), splenic volume to BSA (SV/BSA), ratio of TLV to SV (TLV/SV), ratio of right liver volume to SV (RV/SV), and liver segmental volume ratio (LSVR) were measured. ROC analyses were performed for ECV and CTV.  Results:   After excluding 10 patients, seventy-eight (97.5%) out of 80 patients had a Child-Pugh score of 5 points, and two (2.5%) patients had a Child-Pugh score of 6 points. AUC of ECV showed no significant difference among manual-ECV, rigid-ECV, and nonrigid-ECV. TLV/BSA, SV/BSA, TLV/SV, and RV/SV had a higher correlation with LF grades than manual-ECV. AUC of SV/BSA was significantly higher than that of manual-ECV in F0-1 vs F2-4 and F0-2 vs F3-4. AUC of SV/BSA (0.76-0.83) was higher than that of manual-ECV (0.61-0.75) for all LF grades, although manual-ECV could differentiate between F0-3 and F4 at high AUC (0.75).

Methods:   We performed a prospective multicenter study of MWA and RFA for PHPT between August 2017 and October 2020 at five centers. Laboratory testing was performed pre- and post-ablation and followed for at least 6 months. The primary outcome was the cure rate. Secondary outcomes were complications and dynamic changes in serum levels of PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and ALP after ablation.  Results:   A total of 132 participants (mean age, 57.33 ± 13.90 years), with 141 parathyroid nodules (median maximal diameter, 1.55 cm) undergoing either MWA or RFA, were enrolled in the study. The technique success rate was 99.29% (140/141). The follow-up period was 6-36 months (median, 12 months). The cure rate was 80.30% (106/132). Pre-ablation PTH level was the independent factor associated with cure rate (Odds ratio (OR), 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07-0.69; p = 0.0090).

This study was aimed to investigate the influence of HH on reflux patterns and distal esophageal mucosal integrity in non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed PPI-refractory NERD patients referred to three tertiary referral centers who underwent high-resolution manometry and off-PPI 24-h impedance-pH monitoring (with or without bile spectrophotometry). Patients with HH ≥2 cm (HH group, n = 42) or no HH (non-HH group, n = 40) with similar esophageal acid exposure time (AET 6%-12%) were included.  Key results:   Age, gender, BMI, esophageal motility, AET, and esophageal clearance were similar between the two groups. The HH group had higher numbers of total reflux episodes (p = 0.015) with similar proportion of acid/non-acid reflux compared with the non-HH group. Mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) in the distal esophagus was significantly lower in the HH group than the non-HH group at both 5 cm (p = 0.002) and 3 cm (p = 0.015) above the lower esophageal sphincter. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HH, less non-acid reflux and lower post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index (PSPWI) were independently associated with lower MNBI. Among 31 patients tested with bile spectrophotometry, the HH group had significantly longer bile exposure time than the non-HH group (p = 0.011), and bile reflux inversely and significantly correlated with MNBI (rho = -0.75, p &lt; 0.001).  Conclusions and inferences:   Hiatus hernia, less non-acid reflux and lower PSPWI were associated with lower MNBI.

These techniques are rather complicated and success rates are not perfect. Therefore, the authors developed a novel technique, transtympanic soft tissue (TST) tympanoplasty, which does not require raising eardrums, and evaluated its surgical efficiency compared to perichondrium underlay (PU) tympanoplasty.  Study design:   A retrospective study was conducted in a single center.  Methods:   152 cases who underwent TST tympanoplasty (n = 70) or PU tympanoplasty (n = 82) between 2011 and 2020 were included in the study. Perforation location, pure tone audiometry, complications, and closure rates were analyzed according to the size of the TM perforations: moderate perforation (25-40%, n = 100) and large perforation (≥ 40%, n = 52).  Results:   For the moderate perforations, the closure rates of the TST (n = 45) and PU (n = 55) groups were 93.3% and 89.1%, respectively (p = 0.461), and even for the large perforations, the success rates were 88.0% in the TST group (n = 25) and 81.5% in the PU group (n = 27) (p = 0.515). The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) values of the TST group for moderate and large perforations were 5.3 ± 5.8 dB and 6.6 ± 5.7 dB, respectively. There was no significant difference in postoperative ABG between the two surgical procedures (p > 0.05). The total operation time for TST tympanoplasty was significantly shorter than that for PU tympanoplasty (p = 0.002).

Methods:   Data from 220 patients classified as diffuse glioma, NOS, between January 2011 and December 2020 were retrospectively included. Two neuroradiologists analyzed pre-surgical CT and MRI to assign gliomas to the three imaging-based risk types considering well-known imaging phenotypes (e.g., T2/FLAIR mismatch). According to the 2021 World Health Organization classification, the three risk types included (1) low-risk, expecting oligodendroglioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, and 1p/19q-codeleted; (2) intermediate-risk, expecting astrocytoma, IDH-mutant; and (3) high-risk, expecting glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated for each risk type. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis using 10-fold cross-validation with 100-fold bootstrapping was used to compare the performance of an imaging-based survival model with that of a historical molecular-based survival model published in 2015, created using The Cancer Genome Archive data.  Results:   Prognostication according to the three imaging-based risk types was achieved for both PFS and OS (log-rank test, p < 0.001). The imaging-based survival model showed high prognostic value, with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.772 and 0.650 for 1-year PFS and OS, respectively, similar to the historical molecular-based survival model (AUC = 0.74 for PFS and 0.87 for OS). The imaging-based survival model achieved high long-term performance in both 3-year PFS (AUC = 0.806) and 5-year OS (AUC = 0.812).  Conclusion:   Imaging-based risk stratification achieved histomolecular-level prognostication in diffuse glioma, NOS, and could aid in guiding patient referral for insufficient or unsuccessful molecular diagnosis.  Key points:   • Three imaging-based risk types enable distinct prognostication in diffuse glioma, NOS (not otherwise specified). • The imaging-based survival model achieved similar prognostic performance as a historical molecular-based survival model. • For long-term prognostication of 3 and 5 years, the imaging-based survival model showed high performance.""","""['Eun Bee Jang', 'Ho Sung Kim', 'Ji Eun Park', 'Seo Young Park', 'Yeo Kyung Nam', 'Soo Jung Nam', 'Young-Hoon Kim', 'Jeong Hoon Kim']""","""[' Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, 88 Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, 88 Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea. radhskim@gmail.com.', ' Department of Statistics and Data Science, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Shinchon Yonsei Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Pathology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Editorial comment: ""Diffuse glioma, not otherwise specified: imaging-based risk stratification achieves histomolecular-level prognostication"".', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Reproducible imaging-based prediction of molecular subtype and risk stratification of gliomas across different experience levels using a structured reporting system.', 'MR textural analysis on T2 FLAIR images for the prediction of true oligodendroglioma by the 2016 WHO genetic classification.', 'The T2-FLAIR-mismatch sign as an imaging biomarker for IDH and 1p/19q status in diffuse low-grade gliomas: a systematic review with a Bayesian approach to evaluation of diagnostic test performance.', 'A review of adult-type diffuse gliomas in the WHO CNS5 classification with special reference to Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant and Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q codeleted.', 'Clinical updates on gliomas and implications of the 5th edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system tumors.']"""

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 152 patients with ampullary stricture (98 benign and 54 malignant) who underwent contrast-enhanced CT were included. Various imaging findings of the ampulla, bile duct, main pancreatic duct, and periampullary area were evaluated and clinical findings including the presence of jaundice, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level, and history of cholecystectomy were collected. Among them, statistically significant findings were identified using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A nomogram was constructed to differentiate benign and malignant ampullary strictures and was internally validated.  Results:   Multivariable analysis revealed that jaundice (odds ratio [OR]: 17.33, p < 0.001), presence of an ampullary mass (OR: 24.40, p < 0.001), non-similar enhancement of the ampulla to the duodenum (OR: 31.96, p = 0.003), and proportional dilatation of the bile duct (OR: 7.98, p = 0.001) were independent significant factors for predicting the malignant ampullary stricture, and were used to construct a nomogram. Among them, non-similar enhancement of the ampulla to the duodenum showed the highest OR and predictor point on the nomogram. The calibration plots showed excellent agreement between the predicted probabilities and the actual rates of malignant ampullary strictures, on internal validation.  Conclusions:   Combination of clinical and imaging findings could aid in predicting malignant ampullary strictures using significant findings of jaundice, presence of ampullary mass, non-similar enhancement of the ampulla to the duodenum, and proportional dilatation of the bile duct.

Nebulized and oral medications offer an alternative drug delivery method that may provide therapeutic benefits and reduce medication expenditure. Objectives: Primary research objectives were to determine the cost per patient per claim per day for inhaler devices, nebulized medications, or oral corticosteroids and to estimate the monetary waste generated by using inhalers at the end of life. Design: A retrospective pharmacoeconomic analysis of claims adjudicated by a national hospice-centric pharmacy benefit manager between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Setting/Subjects: A total of 37,935 adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospice with a primary diagnosis of end-stage respiratory disease in the United States were included in the study. Results: A total of 295,451 claims for inhalers, nebulized medications, and oral corticosteroids were analyzed. The mean costs per patient per claim per day were $10.64 for inhalers, $3.28 for nebulized medications, and $1.02 for oral corticosteroids. These costs were significantly different from each other (all p values <0.001). Total monetary waste resulting from unused inhaler doses was $1,040,669, with 21.0%, 13.1%, and 7.3% of patients having claims for inhalers within 30, 14, and 7 days of discharge, respectively. Conclusions: Inhaler use near the end of life generates a significant amount of monetary waste. Using a combination of nebulized and oral medications could reduce health care costs. Nebulized medications may generate less waste since providers can tailor the dispensed supply to the patient's needs rather than using the standard one-month supply of inhaler devices.""","""['Maximillian H Stevenson', 'Bridget McCrate Protus', 'Amanda G Lovell', 'Junan Li', 'Maureen L Saphire']""","""[' Department of Medicine, Section of Palliative Care, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC, USA.', ' Clinical Services, Optum Hospice Pharmacy Services, Westerville, Ohio, USA.', ' The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ' Department of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Palliat Med""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Comparison of the effectiveness of inhaler devices in asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease: a systematic review of the literature.', 'A cautionary tale of multiple-dose drug products: Fluticasone and salmeterol combination inhaler waste.', 'Suicidal Ideation.', 'Systematic review and economic analysis of the comparative effectiveness of different inhaled corticosteroids and their usage with long-acting beta2 agonists for the treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children aged 12 years and over.']"""

Methods:   The data of 86 uterine sarcomas between July 2011 and December 2019 and 86 ALMs between June 2013 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. We extracted deep-learning features and radiomics features from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The two feature extraction methods, transfer learning and radiomics, were compared. Random forest was adopted as the classifier. T2WI features, DWI features, combined T2WI and DWI (mp-MRI) features, and combined clinical parameters and mp-MRI features were applied to establish T2, DWI, T2-DWI, and complex multiparameter (mp) models, respectively. Predictive performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   In the test set, the T2, DWI, T2-DWI and complex mp models based on transfer learning (AUCs range from 0.76 to 0.81, 0.80 to 0.88, 0.85 to 0.92, and 0.94 to 0.96, respectively) outperformed the models based on radiomics (AUCs of 0.73, 0.76, 0.79, and 0.92, respectively). Moreover, the complex mp model showed the best prediction performance, with the Resnet50-complex mp model achieving the highest AUC (0.96) and accuracy (0.87).  Conclusions:   Transfer learning is feasible and superior to radiomics in the differential diagnosis of uterine sarcomas and ALMs in our dataset. ML models based on deep learning features of nonenhanced mp-MRI and clinical parameters can achieve good diagnostic efficacy.  Key points:   • The ML model combining nonenhanced mp-MRI features and clinical parameters can distinguish uterine sarcomas from ALMs. • Transfer learning can be applied to differentiate uterine sarcomas from ALMs and outperform radiomics. • The most accurate prediction model was Resnet50-based transfer learning, built with the deep-learning features of mp-MRI and clinical parameters.""","""['Mengying Dai#', 'Yang Liu#', 'Yan Hu', 'Guanghui Li', 'Jian Zhang', 'Zhibo Xiao', 'Fajin Lv']""","""[' State Key Laboratory of Ultrasound in Medicine and Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering, Chongqing Medical University, Yixueyuan Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', ' Chongqing Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', ' Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', ' State Key Laboratory of Ultrasound in Medicine and Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering, Chongqing Medical University, Yixueyuan Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China. 5894526@qq.com.', ' Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China. 5894526@qq.com.', ' State Key Laboratory of Ultrasound in Medicine and Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering, Chongqing Medical University, Yixueyuan Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China. fajinlv@163.com.', ' Chongqing Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China. fajinlv@163.com.', ' Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China. fajinlv@163.com.', ' Institute of Medical Data, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China. fajinlv@163.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Machine Learning to Differentiate T2-Weighted Hyperintense Uterine Leiomyomas from Uterine Sarcomas by Utilizing Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Quantitative Imaging Features.', 'Diagnostic Algorithm to Differentiate Benign Atypical Leiomyomas from Malignant Uterine Sarcomas with Diffusion-weighted MRI.', 'A multiparametric MRI-based machine learning to distinguish between uterine sarcoma and benign leiomyoma: comparison with 18F-FDG PET/CT.', 'A combined radiomics and clinical variables model for prediction of malignancy in T2 hyperintense uterine mesenchymal tumors on MRI.', 'Voxel-based supervised machine learning of peripheral zone prostate cancer using noncontrast multiparametric MRI.', 'CT-based deep learning radiomics signature for the preoperative prediction of the muscle-invasive status of bladder cancer.', 'The diagnosis, classification, and treatment of sarcoma in this era of artificial intelligence and immunotherapy.']"""

The ECAAs were anatomically categorized using the Attigah and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) classifications. The possible study outcomes were restenosis or occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery after treatment and treatment-associated morbidity or mortality.The 41 patients were stratified into three groups according to the management strategies employed: surgical (n = 25, 61.0%), endovascular (n = 10, 24.4%), and conservative treatment (n = 6, 14.6%). A palpable, pulsatile mass was the most common clinical manifestation (n = 16, 39.0%), and degenerative aneurysms (n = 29, 65.9%) represented the most common pathogenetic or etiological mechanism. According to the Attigah classification, type I ECAAs (n = 24, 58.5%) were the most common. Using the PUMCH classification, type I ECAAs (n = 26, 63.4%) were the most common. There was a higher prevalence of Attigah type I ECAAs among patients who underwent surgical treatment compared with those who underwent endovascular treatment (64.0% vs 40.0%, P = .09), whereas patients with PUMCH type IIa aneurysms were more likely to receive endovascular treatment (12.0% vs 30.0%). False aneurysms were more likely to be treated using endovascular techniques (20% vs 70%, P = 0.02). Except for two early internal carotid artery occlusions (one each among patients who underwent surgical and endovascular treatments, respectively), there were no early or late restenoses or occlusions during follow-up. Cranial nerve injuries were noted in three patients after surgical treatment, and late ipsilateral strokes occurred in two patients (one each among patients who underwent endovascular and conservative treatment, respectively). There were no other treatment-associated complications or deaths during the study period.

Since January 2019, we have been conducting an early and proactive grip strength training program (EGTP). In this program, 20 minutes of grip strength training-using a gripper with a load of 0.7 kg-was initiated from 2 weeks after surgery; the load was then gradually increased. From 6 weeks postsurgery, daily home grip strength training was performed using a gripper with a load of 5 kg, provided to the patient.We investigated whether the introduction of the EGTP could lead to earlier recovery of grip strength. We also examined whether the EGTP caused postoperative correction loss at the fractured site, or contributed to the early improvement of wrist function.Thirty-nine patients who underwent surgery using VLPs for distal radius fractures were included in this study; 20 followed the EGTP (EGTP group) and 19 patients did not (NGTP group). For these patients, grip strength and range of motion of the wrist joint were evaluated both 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (qDASH) scores were also evaluated 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, corrective losses of radial inclination (RI), palmar tilt (PT), and ulnar variance (UV)-occurring from immediately postsurgery to 6 months after surgery-were evaluated.At both 3 and 6 months postoperatively, the grip strength of the EGTP group was significantly higher than that of the NGTP group. Regarding range of motion, only palmar flexion was significantly improved in the EGTP group at 3 months postoperatively. Conversely, no differences in corrective losses of RI, PT, and UV, or in qDASH scores, were observed between the two groups.The results of this study suggest that the EGTP can provide early recovery of grip strength and palmar flexion of the wrist without causing corrective loss at the fracture site.""","""['Yoshio Kaji', 'Konosuke Yamaguchi', 'Yumi Nomura', 'Kunihiko Oka', 'Osamu Nakamura', 'Yoichi Ishibashi', 'Tetsuji Yamamoto']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kagawa University Faculty of Medicine, Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Japan.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Kagawa Prefectural Shirotori Hospital, Mastubara, Higashikagawa City, Kagawa, Japan.']""","""2022""","""2022 May""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Corrective Osteotomy with Volar and Dorsal Fixation for Malunion of Intra-Articular Fracture of the Distal Radius: A Retrospective Study.', 'Is it really necessary to restore radial anatomic parameters after distal radius fractures?', 'Fixed-angle volar plates in corrective osteotomies of malunions of dorsally angulated distal radius fractures.', 'Surgical treatment of unstable distal radius fractures with volar locking plates.', 'Comparison of outcomes between partially healed and acute metaphyseally malaligned distal radial fracture treated by palmar locking plate fixation.']"""

Extended embryo culture to the blastocyst stage provides some theoretical advantages and disadvantages. There has been controversy. This study is sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of vitrified-warmed cleavage-stage and blastocyst-stage embryo transfers in patients undergoing Artificial Reproductive Technique treatments.  Material and method:   The study was performed on 2740 women undergoing frozen embryo thawing transfer. Patients' basic situation, status of frozen embryo transfer cycle, clinical pregnancy rate, early abortion rate, sex ratio of birth, and birth weight were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the main clinical results of recovery of frozen embryo on the cleavage stage and blastocyst stage. Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of blastocyst cryopreservation on Day 5, 6, or 7 after oocyte retrieval according to the day of blastocyst expansion were evaluated.  Results:   The implantation ratio of cleavage stage embryos was 21.62% compared with 43.52% on D5 (P < .05). The D5, D6, and D7 implanting rates were statistically different. The pregnancy rates were 57.56%, 51.76%, and 35.95% versus 37.79%, respectively for embryos cryopreserved on D5, D6, D7, and D3. The ectopic pregnancy rate and early abortion rate were statistically different between D5 and D3. The sex ratio, the birth weight, and birth defect were not statistically different among the four groups.  Conclusions:   Blastocyst transfer achieved a higher implantation rate than vitrified cleavage stage embryo and decreased ectopic pregnancy rate.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) in predicting surgical site infection (SSI) following instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) of lumbar degenerative diseases. This study enrolled patients who underwent PLIF and instrumentation for treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases between 2015 and 2020. Electronic medical records were inquired for data collection, with follow-up register for identifying SSI cases. The optimal cut-off for CAR was determined by constructing the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Patients with high- or low-CAR value were compared using the univariate analyses, and the association between CAR and the risk of SSI was investigated using multivariate logistics regression analysis. A total of 905 patients were enrolled, twenty-nine (3.2%) had developed an SSI with 72.4% occurring during index hospitalisation, and 11 (1.2%) had deep and 18 (2.0%) superficial SSIs. An SSI was associated with additional 10.7 days of index total hospital stay (P = .001). The CAR was 0-5.43 (median, 0.05), and the optimal cut-off was 0.09 and area under the curve was 0.720 (P < .001). 336 (37.1%) patients had a CAR ≥0.09 and 22 (6.5%) developed an SSI, with a crude risk of 5.6 relative to those with a low CAR. The multivariate analyses showed CAR ≥0.09 was associated with 8.06-fold increased risk of SSI, together with diabetes (P = .018), while hypertension was identified as a protective factor (OR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.11-1.00, P = .049).

Methods:   TCA, MCS, TFO and TFCS were measured in preoperative and postoperative radiographs of 107 bimalleolar ankle fractures and in 83 follow-up radiographs, accounting for a total of 297 radiographs and 1182 measurements. Preoperative radiographs were categorized according to Danis-Weber classification. For all included cases, basic demographic data, dates of radiographs and surgery, and type of fixation used were acquired. Variables associated with postoperative and follow-up total anatomical reconstitution (i.e., when the four assessed radiological parameters were normalized), normalization of each radiological parameter, and improvement in the number of normalized radiological parameters were identified through univariable Cox regression analysis.  Results:   In our sample, 23.8% of the ankle fractures in postoperative radiographs and 28% in follow-up radiographs achieved a complete anatomical restoration. Type C fractures (hazard ratio [HR]=0.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.02-0.7, P=0.021) were associated with lower chances of total anatomical reconstitution. The use of reconstruction plates (HR=0.1, 95% CI=0.03-0.7, P=0.014) and one third tubular plates (HR=0.2, 95% CI=0.03-0.8, P=0.026) decreased the chances of improving the number of normalized radiological parameters. Waiting days until surgery impaired total anatomical reconstitution (HR=0.8, 95% CI=0.6-0.9, P=0.012) and also reduced the chances of improving the number of normalized radiological parameters (HR=0.9, 95% CI=0.9-1.0, P=0.045).  Conclusion:   The radiological results for the treatment of bimalleolar fractures are time sensitive, and surgery should thus be performed as soon as possible, using adequate fixation materials, in order to achieve a better restoration of ankle anatomy.

Sparse published researches evaluated the prognostic value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) for ICI-associated myocarditis.  Methods:   In the single-center retrospective study, 52 patients with ICI-associated myocarditis and CMR were included from August 2018 to July 2021. The ICI-associated myocarditis was diagnosed by using the clinical criteria of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were comprised of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and complete heart block.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 171 days, 14 (27%) patients developed MACE. For patients with MACE, the global circumferential strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), global longitudinal strain (GLS), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were significantly worse and native T1 values and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) extent were significantly increased, compared with patients without MACE (p < 0.05). The GLS remained the independent factor associated with a higher risk of MACE (hazard ratio (HR): 2.115; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.379-3.246; p = 0.001) when adjusting for LVEF, LGE extent, age, sex, body mass index, steroid treatment, and prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy or radiation. After adjustment for LVEF, the GLS remained the independent risk factor associated with a higher rate of MACE among patients with a preserved LVEF (HR: 1.358; 95% CI: 1.007-1.830; p = 0.045).  Conclusions:   GLS could provide independent prognostic value over GCS, GRS, traditional CMR features, and clinical features in patients with ICI-associated myocarditis.  Key points:   • The global circumferential strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), and global longitudinal strain (GLS) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking were significantly impaired in patients with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis. • GLS was still significantly impaired in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. • The worse GLS was an independent risk factor over GCS, GRS, traditional CMR features, and clinical features for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with ICI-associated myocarditis.""","""['Shi-Hai Zhao#', 'Hong Yun#', 'Cai-Zhong Chen#', 'Yin-Yin Chen', 'Jin-Yi Lin', 'Meng-Su Zeng', 'Tian-Shu Liu', 'Cui-Zhen Pan', 'Hang Jin']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and Shanghai Institute of Medical Imaging, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', ' Department of Medical Imaging, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Cancer Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Cardiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Radiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and Shanghai Institute of Medical Imaging, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. mengsuzeng@sina.com.', ' Department of Medical Imaging, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. mengsuzeng@sina.com.', ' Department of Cancer Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. mengsuzeng@sina.com.', ' Department of Medical Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ' Department of Echocardiography, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. pcuizhen@126.com.', '0 Department of Radiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and Shanghai Institute of Medical Imaging, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. hangjin016@126.com.', '1 Department of Medical Imaging, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. hangjin016@126.com.', '2 Department of Cancer Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. hangjin016@126.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Strain in Suspected Myocarditis With Preserved LV-EF: A Comparison Between Patients With Negative and Positive Late Gadolinium Enhancement Findings.', 'Feature Tracking Myocardial Strain Incrementally Improves Prognostication in Myocarditis Beyond Traditional CMR Imaging Features.', 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance in immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis.', 'Cardiac MRI Findings in COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Myocarditis: A Pooled Analysis of 468 Patients.', 'What Is the Evidence of the Diagnostic\xa0Criteria and Screening of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Myocarditis?', 'Overcoming the cardiac toxicities of cancer therapy immune checkpoint inhibitors.', 'Cardiac imaging techniques for the assessment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced cardiotoxicity and their potential clinical applications.', 'Sintilimab induced ICIAM in the treatment of advanced HCC: A case report and analysis of research progress.']"""

And the correlation between the staging and the recidivism of cholesteatoma after grouping according to operation was evaluated.  Methods:   A total of 123 ears of 118 patients that underwent surgery for primary cholesteatoma from November 2008 to May 2020 were included in this retrospective study, and then classified and staged according to the EAONO/JOS, STAMCO, and ChOLE cholesteatoma staging system, respectively. Each indicator involved in the system above was analyzed separately to evaluate its prognostic value for cholesteatoma recidivism.  Results:   The type of surgical procedure performed (P = 0.020) was shown to be associated with cholesteatoma recidivism. Cholesteatoma location the supratubal recess (S1) (P = 0.026, HR = 3.614, 95% CI 1.137, 7.945), and the sinus tympani (S2) (P = 0.004, HR = 4.208, 95% CI 1.574, 11.250) were shown to be significantly associated with disease recidivism. When focusing on the CWU operation group, ossicular chain status in STAMCO stage (P = 0.043) and in the ChOLE stage (P = 0.018) were significantly associated with cholesteatoma recidivism. The results had shown no association between the three stages and cholesteatoma recidivism in the CWD and endoscopic surgery groups.  Conclusions:   Based on our study, the EAONO/JOS, STAMCO, and ChOLE Classifications have limited value in predicting cholesteatoma recidivism, in acquired middle ear cholesteatoma in children. Adding the pathological status of the ossicular chain may be useful for predicting the recidivism of cholesteatoma.

Methods:   From January 2019 through December 2020, 163 participants who underwent high-gradient 3-T MRI of the bladder were prospectively enrolled. In total, 108 participants with pathologically confirmed bladder cancer by transurethral resection were analyzed. Tumors were evaluated based on VI-RADS (scores 1-5) by two readers independently: an experienced radiologist (reader 1) and a senior radiology resident (reader 2). Conventional VI-RADS assessment included all three imaging types (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging [DCEI]). Also evaluated were NCE-VI-RADS comprising only non-contrast-enhanced imaging types (T2WI and DWI), and ""NCE-VI-RADS with dDLR"" comprising T2WI processed with dDLR and DWI. All systems were assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis and simple and/or weighted κ statistics.  Results:   Muscle invasion was identified in 23/108 participants (21%). Area under the curve (AUC) values for diagnosing muscle invasion were as follows: conventional VI-RADS, 0.94 and 0.91; NCE-VI-RADS, 0.93 and 0.91; and ""NCE-VI-RADS with dDLR"", 0.96 and 0.93, for readers 1 and 2, respectively.

In our study, we aimed to evaluate the incremental benefits of SZM features for the prognosis of lung ADC.  Methods:   A total of 298 patients were included and their pretreatment computed tomography images were analyzed in fivefold cross-validation. We built a risk model of overall survival using SZM features and compared it with a conventional radiomics risk model and a clinical variable-based risk model. We also compared it with other models incorporating various combinations of SZM features, other radiomics features, and clinical variables. A total of seven risk models were compared and evaluated using the hazard ratio (HR) on the left-out test fold.  Results:   As a baseline, the clinical variable risk model showed an HR of 2.739. Combining the radiomics signature with SZM feature was better (HR 4.034) than using radiomics signature alone (HR 3.439). Combining radiomics signature, SZM feature, and clinical variable (HR 6.524) fared better than just combining radiomics signature and clinical variables (HR 4.202). These results confirmed the added benefits of SZM features for prognosis in lung ADC.  Conclusion:   Combining SZM feature with the radiomics signature was better than using the radiomics signature alone and the benefits of SZM features were maintained when clinical variables were added confirming the incremental benefits of SZM features for lung ADC prognosis.

This study aimed to identify the preoperative clinical features that can be curatively treated with ESD in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) beyond the indication of ESD.  Methods:   From 2006 to 2016, 673 patients who underwent gastrectomy for EGC beyond the expanded indication for ESD based on preoperative assessments were retrospectively reviewed. We identified tumors curatively resected by ESD based on the postoperative pathologic findings. We also analyzed the clinical and pre-treatment features to determine the risk factors associated with curative resection of ESD.  Results:   39% of the patients (263/673) who had undergone gastrectomy had tumors of endoscopic curability A or B (eCuraA/B) that could be treated by ESD alone. In multivariate analysis, tumor size ≤ 10 mm (OR 0.240; 95% CI = 0.12-0.46), no ulceration (OR 0.500; 95% CI = 0.29-0.87), differentiated histology (OR 0.599; 95% CI = 0.43-0.84), and location in the distal two-thirds of the stomach (OR 0.499; 95% CI = 0.28-0.88) in pre-treatment assessment were identified as independent predictors of eCuraA/B. Considering the risk factors, 63.6% (7/11)/61.3% (19/31) of patients with a differentiated/undifferentiated tumor size ≤ 10 mm located in distal two-third of the stomach without ulceration were deemed as eCuraA/B.

A simplified method to estimate LSN score may be useful in the clinic.  Purpose:   To evaluate the regional analysis of LSN and processing time in a single axial liver MR image for staging liver fibrosis.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 210 subjects, a multicenter study.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T/noncontrast gradient echo T1WI.  Assessment:   Subjects were divided into five fibrosis groups (F0 = 29; F1 = 20; F2 = 32; F3 = 50; F4 = 79) based on the METAVIR fibrosis scoring system. The mean LSN (on three slices) and regional LSN (on one slice) measurements, and the processing times, are compared. The regional LSN scores in five regions-of-interests (ROI1-5 ) were analyzed in a single axial MRI at the level of the hilum by two independent observers.  Statistical tests:   Regional variations in LSN scores were compared using ANOVA with Tukey test. Agreement between the mean and regional LSN measurements was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and Bland-Altman plots. The diagnostic performance of mean and regional LSN scores according to fibrosis stage was evaluated with the AUROC. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Total processing time for a regional LSN measurement (3.6 min) was 75.5% less than that for mean LSN measurement (14.7 min). Mean LSN scores and all five regional LSN scores showed significant differences between fibrosis groups. Among regional LSN scores, ROI5 showed the highest AUROC (0.871 at cut-off 1.12) for discriminating F0-2 vs. F3-4 and the best correlation with mean LSN score (r = 0.800, -0.07 limit of agreement).

A steep increase in the frequency of early cancer and advanced adenoma detection has been evident these late years. Introducing more minimal invasive resection techniques may decrease procedure-related complications and mortality. We aimed to describe the results from introducing endoscopic full-thickness resection (eFTR) in a unit specialized in advanced endoscopic resection of colon neoplasias. Primary outcomes were R0 resection rate and complications.  Methods:   endoscopic full-thickness resection was introduced in our unit in 2017. Patients were referred for eFTR based on indications: (i) completion of resection after unexpected cancer, (ii) suspicion of or clinically confirmed early cancer (T1) without signs of dissemination, or (iii) adenomas not suitable for other endoscopic resection techniques due to difficult position or recurrence. Data on eFTR procedures and follow-up were retrieved from patient journals.  Results:   Thirty-seven eFTR procedures were commenced in the period of March 2017 until June 2020, and one of these was abandoned. The overall R0 resection rate was 83.3%. In subgroups of indications i-iii, it was 87.5, 80.0, and 80.0%, respectively. Three perforations and one case of late bleeding occurred. One patient died within 30 days due to late perforation. Six technical failures were evident including operator-induced failures. Five of the technical failures occurred in the first half of the procedures indicating the learning curve of the endoscopist.  Conclusion:   Implementation of the eFTR procedure has been largely successful, especially in patients referred for completion of resection after unexpected cancer. Complication rates were acceptable, and the technique and quality increased significantly during the study. Careful selection of patients for eFTR is crucial for achieving successful resection.

Methods:   Perioperative data of elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with HCC who underwent RLR or OLR between January 2010 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. A 1:2 propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed to minimize the differences between RLR and OLR groups.

Results:   Of the 427 elderly HCC patients included in this study, 113 underwent RLR and 314 underwent OLR. After the 1:2 PSM, there were 100 and 178 patients in the RLR and the OLR groups, respectively. The RLR group had a less estimated blood loss (EBL), a shorter postoperative length of stay (LOS), and a lower complications rate (all P < 0.05), compared with the OLR group before and after PSM. Univariable and multivariable analyses showed that advanced age and surgical approaches were not independent risk factors for long-term prognosis. The two groups of elderly patients who were performed RLR or OLR had similar OS (median OS 52.8 vs. 57.6 months) and RFS (median RFS 20.4 vs. 24.6 months) rates after PSM.

Implications on treatment outcomes: Lessons from Botswana""","""The two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP), are currently the core antiretroviral drugs for treatment of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa including Botswana. The drugs are metabolized by Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) liver enzyme. The CYP2B6 gene that encodes for metabolism of these drugs is known to be highly polymorphic. One of the polymorphism in the CYP2B6 gene, 516G>T, particularly the 516T allele, is known to confer poor metabolism of EFV and NVP. This may lead to high levels of plasma drug concentrations and development of treatment toxicities, like central nervous system toxicities, and cutaneous and hepatic toxicities, for EFV and NVP, respectively. The CYP2B6 516G allele on the other hand is associated with an extensive metabolism of the two NNRTIs drugs. We sought to establish association between possible developments of NNRTIs toxicities with CYP2B6 516G>T variation in Botswana.A total of 316 peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples were used in a retrospective view. All the samples were from participants on EFV/NVP-containing regimen with known toxicity output. TaqMan Real-Time PCR approach was applied for assessing CYP2B6 516 allele variation in cases with treatment toxicity and those without. Analysis was performed by chi-square statistics and logistic regression analysis.The rate of poor metabolizers among participants with toxicity and those without toxicity was 18.4% and 15.1%, respectively. The CYP2B6 516 genotype distribution comparisons between the participants with toxicity and those without were not statistically different (chi-square = .326; P = .568).CYP2B6 516 variation was not associated with NNRTI toxicity.

The purpose was (i) to cement vertically the sacral alae all along and within the lateral fracture lines, resembling the pillars of a tower, and (ii) to reinforce cranially with a horizontal S1 landing zone (or dense central bone) resembling the first level of the tower. An electromagnetic navigation system was used in combination with CT and fluoroscopic guidance to overtop extreme angulation challenges. All patients treated between January 2019 and October 2021 in a single tertiary center were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   A description of the technique is provided. Twelve female patients (median age: 80 years [range: 32 to 94]) were treated for sacral insufficiency fractures with the ""Eiffel Tower"" technique. The median treatment delay was 8 weeks (range: 3 to 20) and the initial median pain assessed by the visual analogue scale was 7 (range: 6 to 8). Pain was successfully relieved (visual analogue score < 3) for 9 patients (75%) and persisted for 2 patients (17%). One patient was lost during the follow-up. No complication was noted.  Conclusion:   The ""Eiffel Tower"" multimodal cementoplasty integrates recent technological developments, in particular electromagnetic navigation, with the purpose of reconstructing the biomechanical chain of the sacral bone.  Key points:   • Sacral insufficiency fractures are common and can be efficiently treated with percutaneous sacroplasty. • The long axis sacroplasty approach can be challenging given both the shape of the sacral bone and the angulation to reach the target lesion. • The ""Eiffel Tower"" technique is a novel approach using electromagnetic navigation to expand the concept of the long axis route, adding a horizontal S1 landing zone.""","""['Tom Boeken', 'Eimad Shotar', 'Évelyne Cormier', 'Déborah Puyraimond-Zemmour', 'Atika Talbi', 'Raphaël Bonaccorsi', 'Jugurtha Mahtout', 'Mehdi Drir', 'Frédéric Clarençon', 'Kévin Premat']""","""["" Department of Neuroradiology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Sorbonne University, APHP, 47, Bd de l'Hôpital, 75013, Paris, France."", ' Department of Rheumatology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Sorbonne University, APHP, Paris, France.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Sorbonne University, APHP, Paris, France.', ' Department of Anesthesiology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Sorbonne University, APHP, Paris, France.', ' Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', ' GRC BioFast, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', "" Department of Neuroradiology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Sorbonne University, APHP, 47, Bd de l'Hôpital, 75013, Paris, France. kevin.premat@aphp.fr.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['First experience using navigation-guided radiofrequency kyphoplasty for sacroplasty in sacral insufficiency fractures.', 'Sacroplasty: A Ten-Year Analysis of Prospective Patients Treated with Percutaneous Sacroplasty: Literature Review and Technical Considerations.', 'Additional Sacroplasty Does Not Improve Clinical Outcome in Minimally Invasive Navigation-Assisted Screw Fixation Procedures for Nondisplaced Insufficiency Fractures of the Sacrum.', 'Sacroplasty.', 'Sacral Fractures and Sacroplasty.']"""

Therefore, elective treatments at hospitals were cancelled and patients with chronic ailments were instructed to stay at home and minimise the time spent in public areas. The second was due to COVID-19-induced anxiety that deterred many patients from seeking care and adhering to periodic out-patient visits. In this study, we examined the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic diabetes who suffered from contaminated diabetic ulcers. We conducted a retrospective study with patients who had undergone amputations following diabetic ulcers during 2019-2020. The research group included diabetic amputees during the COVID-19 outbreak period ranging from March 2020 to December 2020. The control group included diabetic amputees from the corresponding period in 2019. Using the Wagner Scale, we measured the difference in the severity of ulcers upon the patient's initial admission. Additionally, we examined patient survival rates based on the size of amputations, by specifically focusing on the period between 1- and 6-months post-surgery. The results failed to suggest a clear and statistically significant worsening trend in the condition of patients in the research and control groups. Due to public lockdowns, transportation restrictions, scarcity of healthcare staff, and reduced adherence to exposure anxiety, patients with diabetic foot ulcers received inferior medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this study could not find a statistically significant difference in the mortality and major amputation rates in patients with diabetic ulcer before and during the pandemic.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the complication rates of same-day bilateral TKA (TKA bilat) with that of unilateral TKA (TKA unilat). The hypothesis was bilateral TKA increases the rate of early and late complications in a group of selected patients (ASA 1 or 2, less than 80 years of age).  Material and methods:   Retrospective comparative study of 91 bilat TKA and 182 unilat TKA cases operated on between 2009 and 2016 (1 bilat TKA paired with 2 controls). The patients were matched based on age, sex, indication and ASA score. The minimum follow-up was 2 years. Mortality along with early and late complications were documented. The secondary endpoints were implant survival, functional outcomes, and patient satisfaction.  Results:   The early mortality rate was zero in both groups. The early complication rate was lower in the bilat TKA group (9%) than in the unilat TKA group (22%) (p<0.001). The late complications did not differ between groups. Implant survival at 5 years was 99% (95% CI=[95.6-99.7]) in the bilat TKA group and 97% (95% CI=[92.8-98.8]) in the unilat TKA group. The autologous blood transfusion rate was 33% in the bilat TKA group and 2.2% in the unilat TKA group (p<0.001). There was no difference between groups in the satisfaction rate or the KOOS and New IKS scores. A larger share of patients in the unilat TKA group (54%) said they had forgotten about their knee than in the bilat TKA group (43%) (p=0.036).  Discussion:   There were few early complications in the bilat TKA group. There was no significant difference in the number of late complications, survival, functional scores, or patient satisfaction between the two groups. The transfusion rate was higher in the bilat TKA group, while the forgotten knee rate was higher in the unilat TKA group.  Conclusion:   Our hypothesis was not confirmed: in the context of this study, in patients who are ASA 1 or 2, and less than 80 years old, same-day bilateral TKA does not increase the complication rate relative to unilateral TKA.

Methods:   Retrospective study on 745 patients who underwent combined MRI-TBx plus SBx. Primary outcome was the upgrade to clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa; grade group ≥ 2) on SBx versus MRI-TBx. Variables (age, previous biopsy status, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, index lesion size/location, number of lesions, PSA, PSA density, prostate volume) associated with the primary outcome were identified by logistic regression and used for biopsy strategies. Clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   SBx detected 47 (6%) additional men with csPCa. The risk of detecting csPCa uniquely on SBx was significantly lower in men with PI-RADS 5 (versus PI-RADS 3: OR 0.30, p = 0.03; versus PI-RADS 4: OR 0.33, p = 0.01), and previous negative biopsy (versus previous positive biopsy: OR 0.40, p = 0.007), and increased with age (per 10 years: OR 1.64, p = 0.016). No significant association was observed for other variables. DCA identified the following strategies as most useful: (a) avoid SBx in men with PI-RADS 5 and (b) additionally in those with previous negative biopsy, resulting in avoiding SBx in 201 (27%) and 429 (58%), while missing csPCa in 5 (1%) and 15 (2%) patients, respectively.  Conclusion:   Not all men benefit equally from the combination of SBx and MRI-TBx. SBx avoidance in men with PI-RADS 5 and/or previous negative biopsy may reduce the risk of excess biopsies with a low risk of missing csPCa.  Key points:   • In men undergoing MRI-targeted biopsy, the risk of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) only on additional systematic biopsy (SBx) decreased in men with PI-RADS 5, previous negative biopsy, and younger age. • Using these variables may help select men who could avoid the risk of excess SBx. • If missing csPCa in 5% was acceptable, forgoing SBx in men with PI-RADS 5 and/or previous negative biopsy enabled the highest net reduction in SBx.""","""['Dominik Deniffel', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Stephanie Girgis', 'Gerard M Healy', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Robert Hamilton', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Ants Toi', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[' Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ' Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, 600 University Avenue, M5G 1X5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University Health Network, Sinai Health System and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' Division of Urology, Department of Surgical Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' University of Liverpool School of Medicine, Liverpool, UK.', ' Department of Pathology, Laboratory Medicine Program, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' Department of Surgery, Division of Urology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ' Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, 600 University Avenue, M5G 1X5, Toronto, ON, Canada. mahaider@radfiler.com.', ' Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University Health Network, Sinai Health System and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. mahaider@radfiler.com.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Towards a judicious use of perilesional biopsy in the era of MRI-targeting, parting of the ways from systematic prostate biopsy.', 'Should we combine systematic with MRI-targeted biopsy?

Methods:   A total of 2061 thyroid nodules (in 1859 patients) sampled with fine-needle aspiration or operation were retrospectively analyzed between January 2017 and July 2020. Two radiologists blinded to the pathologic diagnosis evaluated nodule features in five ultrasound categories and assigned TI-RADS scores by both ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS. Inter-rater agreement was assessed by asking another two radiologists to score a set of 100 nodules independently. The reference standard was postoperative pathological or cytopathological diagnosis according to the Bethesda system. Inter-rater agreement was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   AI TI-RADS assigned lower TI-RADS risk levels than ACR TI-RADS (p < 0.001) and had larger area under receiver operating characteristic curve (0.762 vs. 0.679, p < 0.001). The sensitivities of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS were similar (86.7% vs. 82.2%, p = 0.052), but specificity was higher with AI TI-RADS (70.2% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.001).

Methods:   This retrospective study was conducted on 488 patients who underwent biparametric MRI (bp-MRI), including T2-weighted imaging (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of diffusion-weighted imaging, and having biopsy-proven prostate cancer between August 2011 and July 2015. Forty-two of the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and the rest of 446 patients constitute the labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively. A deep learning model was built to predict the density of epithelium, epithelial nuclei, stroma, and lumen from bp-MRI, called MR-driven tissue density. On both the labeled validation set and the whole unlabeled dataset, the quality of MR-driven tissue density and its relation to bp-MRI signal intensity were examined with respect to different histopathologic and radiologic conditions using different statistical analyses.  Results:   MR-driven tissue density and bp-MRI of 446 patients were evaluated. MR-driven tissue density was significantly related to bp-MRI (p < 0.05). The relationship was generally stronger in cancer regions than in benign regions. Regarding cancer grades, significant differences were found in the intensity of bp-MRI and MR-driven tissue density of epithelium, epithelial nuclei, and stroma (p < 0.05). Comparing MR true-negative to MR false-positive regions, MR-driven lumen density was significantly different, similar to the intensity of bp-MRI (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   MR-driven tissue density could serve as a reliable histopathological measure of the prostate on bp-MRI, leading to an improved understanding of prostate cancer and cancer progression.  Key points:   • Semi-supervised deep learning enables non-invasive and quantitative histopathology in the prostate from biparametric MRI. • Tissue density derived from biparametric MRI demonstrates similar characteristics to the direct estimation of tissue density from histopathology images. • The analysis of MR-driven tissue density reveals significantly different tissue compositions among different cancer grades as well as between MR-positive and MR-negative benign.""","""['Minh Nguyen Nhat To', 'Jin Tae Kwak']""","""[' Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ' School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea. jkwak@korea.ac.kr.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Deep Learning Reconstruction Enables Highly Accelerated Biparametric MR Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'T1 and T2 MR fingerprinting measurements of prostate cancer and prostatitis correlate with deep learning-derived estimates of epithelium, lumen, and stromal composition on corresponding whole mount histopathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   From January 2017 to December 2017, 896 patients diagnosed with 930 breast cancers were enrolled in this retrospective study. Commercial AI-CAD was applied to digital mammograms and abnormality scores were obtained. We evaluated the abnormality score according to clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics. False-negative results were defined by abnormality scores less than 10.  Results:   The median abnormality score of 930 breasts was 87.4 (range 0-99). The false-negative rate of AI-CAD was 19.4% (180/930). Cancers with an abnormality score of more than 90 showed a high proportion of palpable lesions, BI-RADS 4c and 5 lesions, cancers presenting as mass with or without microcalcifications and invasive cancers compared with low-scored cancers (all p < 0.001). False-negative cancers were more likely to develop in asymptomatic patients and extremely dense breasts and to be diagnosed as occult breast cancers and DCIS compared to detected cancers.  Conclusion:   Breast cancers depicted with high abnormality scores by AI-CAD are associated with higher BI-RADS category, invasive pathology, and higher cancer stage.  Key points:   • High-scored cancers by AI-CAD included a high proportion of BI-RADS 4c and 5 lesions, masses with or without microcalcifications, and cancers with invasive pathology. • Among invasive cancers, cancers with higher T and N stage and HER2-enriched subtype were depicted with higher abnormality scores by AI-CAD. • Cancers missed by AI-CAD tended to be in asymptomatic patients and extremely dense breasts and to be diagnosed as occult breast cancers by radiologists.""","""['Si Eun Lee', 'Kyunghwa Han', 'Jung Hyun Yoon', 'Ji Hyun Youk', 'Eun-Kyung Kim']""","""[' Department of Radiology, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 363, Dongbaekjukjeon-daero, Giheung-gu, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Research Institute of Radiological Science, Center for Clinical Imaging Data Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Radiology, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 363, Dongbaekjukjeon-daero, Giheung-gu, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. ekkim@yuhs.ac.', ' Department of Radiology, Research Institute of Radiological Science, Center for Clinical Imaging Data Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. ekkim@yuhs.ac.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Application of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis on synthetic mammograms from breast tomosynthesis: comparison with digital mammograms.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Impact of breast density on computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer.', 'The added value of an artificial intelligence system in assisting radiologists on indeterminate BI-RADS 0 mammograms.', 'Supplemental Screening for Breast Cancer in Women With Dense Breasts: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force Internet.']"""

Edema in the peritumoral region (PTR) has been reported to be a negative prognostic factor in TNBC.  Purpose:   To determine whether quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) features from PTRs on reduced field-of-view (rFOV) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) predict the response to NAST in TNBC.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population/subjects:   A total of 108 patients with biopsy-proven TNBC who underwent NAST and definitive surgery during 2015-2020.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3.0 T/rFOV single-shot diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence (DWI).  Assessment:   Three scans were acquired longitudinally (pretreatment, after two cycles of NAST, and after four cycles of NAST). For each scan, 11 ADC histogram features (minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness and 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles) were extracted from tumors and from PTRs of 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm in thickness with inclusion and exclusion of fat-dominant pixels.  Statistical tests:   ADC features were tested for prediction of pCR, both individually using Mann-Whitney U test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and in combination in multivariable models with k-fold cross-validation. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Fifty-one patients (47%) had pCR. Maximum ADC from PTR, measured after two and four cycles of NAST, was significantly higher in pCR patients (2.8 ± 0.69 vs 3.5 ± 0.94 mm2 /sec). The top-performing feature for prediction of pCR was the maximum ADC from the 5-mm fat-inclusive PTR after cycle 4 of NAST (AUC: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.64, 0.84). Multivariable models of ADC features performed similarly for fat-inclusive and fat-exclusive PTRs, with AUCs ranging from 0.68 to 0.72 for the cycle 2 and cycle 4 scans.  Data conclusion:   Quantitative ADC features from PTRs may serve as early predictors of the response to NAST in TNBC.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated iodine contrast stool-tagged CTC scans of 30 consecutive patients (mean age: 69 ± 8 years) undergoing colorectal cancer screening obtained on a dual-layer spectral detector CT scanner. One reader identified locations of electronic cleansing artifacts (n = 229) on conventional and spectral cleansed images. Three additional independent readers evaluated these locations using a conventional cleansing algorithm (Intellispace Portal) and two experimental spectral cleansing algorithms (i.e., fully transparent and translucent tagged stool). For each cleansed image set, readers recorded the severity of over- and under-cleansing artifacts on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = none to 4 = severe) and readability compared to uncleansed images. Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests were used to assess artifact severity, type, and readability (worse, unchanged, or better).  Results:   Compared with conventional cleansing (66% score ≥ 2), the severity of overall cleansing artifacts was lower in transparent (60% score ≥ 2, p = 0.011) and translucent (50% score ≥ 2, p < 0.001) spectral cleansing. Under-cleansing artifact severity was lower in transparent (49% score ≥ 2, p < 0.001) and translucent (39% score ≥ 2, p < 0.001) spectral cleansing compared with conventional cleansing (60% score ≥ 2). Over-cleansing artifact severity was worse in transparent (17% score ≥ 2, p < 0.001) and translucent (14% score ≥ 2, p = 0.023) spectral cleansing compared with conventional cleansing (9% score ≥ 2). Overall readability was significantly improved in transparent (p < 0.001) and translucent (p < 0.001) spectral cleansing compared with conventional cleansing.  Conclusions:   Spectral cleansing provided more robust electronic stool cleansing of iodine-tagged stool at CTC than conventional cleansing.  Key points:   • Spectral-based electronic cleansing of tagged stool at CT colonography provides higher quality images with less perception of artifacts than does conventional cleansing. • Spectral-based electronic cleansing could potentially advance minimally cathartic approach for CT colonography.

The role of ADC histogram analysis in predicting the presence of spermatozoa, prior to testicular sperm extraction (TESE), was also investigated.  Methods:   Forty-one NOA men and 17 age-matched controls underwent scrotal MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Histogram analysis of ADC data of the whole testis was performed. Metrics including mean, standard deviation, median, mode, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of volumetric ADC histograms were calculated. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to assess differences in ADC histogram parameters between NOA histologic categories (hypospermatogenesis, severe hypospermatogenesis, early maturation arrest, and Sertoli cell-only syndrome) and normal testes and, between NOA with positive and negative sperm retrieval.  Results:   Normal testes had a lower mean, median, mode, 25th percentile (p < 0.001), and 75th percentile of ADC (p = 0.001), compared to NOA histologic phenotypes. NOA with hypospermatogenesis had a lower 25th percentile of ADC compared to NOA with severe hypospermatogenesis. Regression analysis revealed that the 25th percentile of ADC had a moderately negative correlation with NOA histologic phenotype. The median ADC proved the most significant metric (p = 0.007) to predict the presence of sperm.  Conclusions:   Testicular volumetric ADC histogram parameters may contribute in the identification of the subpopulation of NOA men with a specific type of spermatogenic arrest.  Key points:   • Volumetric ADC histogram analysis metrics may be used as noninvasive markers of impaired spermatogenesis in nonobstructive azoospermia. • The 25th percentile of ADC proved useful in discriminating between NOA testes with hypospermatogenesis and severe hypospermatogenesis. • The median ADC proved the most significant parameter to predict the presence of viable spermatozoa prior to TESE.""","""['Athina C Tsili', 'Loukas G Astrakas', 'Anna C Goussia', 'Nikolaos Sofikitis', 'Maria I Argyropoulou']""","""[' Department of Clinical Radiology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece. a_tsili@yahoo.gr.', ' Department of Medical Physics, Medical School, University of Ioannina, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece.', ' Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece.', ' Department of Urology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece.', ' Department of Clinical Radiology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Diffusion tensor imaging parameters in testes with nonobstructive azoospermia.', 'Testicular Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Magnetization Transfer Ratio: Can These MRI Parameters Be Used to Predict Successful Sperm Retrieval in Nonobstructive Azoospermia?', 'In vivo biochemical investigation of spermatogenic status: 1H-MR spectroscopy of testes with nonobstructive azoospermia.', 'Outcome of microdissection TESE compared with conventional TESE in non-obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review.', 'Hormonal markers as noninvasive predictors of sperm retrieval in non-obstructive azoospermia.']"""

Methods:   This is a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent laparoscopic MSA device placement between January 2018 and July 2020 after sleeve gastrectomy.  Results:   A total of twenty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty patients were female (91%) and two patients were male (9%). All patients were taking anti-reflux medications daily to control GERD symptoms prior to MSA device placement. There was a significant improvement in the mean GERD-HRQL survey scores when comparing scores prior to (43.8) and after (16.7) MSA device placement (p < 0.0001). Majority of the patients did well without any post-operative complications (77%). Nearly 82% of patients were no longer taking any anti-acid medications after MSA device placement (p < 0.0485).

The purpose of this retrospective study was to report results of arthroscopic burring of the apex of the hamate for hamatolunate impingement, whether isolated or not, in golf players, with a minimum of six months follow-up. Fifteen golf players (10 amateur, 2 semi-professional and 3 professional players), aged 40-61 years, with ulnar carpal pain implicating hamatolunate impingement with Viegas type-II carpal configuration, were included. Treatment consisted in arthroscopic burring of the apex of the hamate. At an average follow-up of 11 months (range, 6-24 months), all patients were satisfied with functional results, except 1 with persistent pain and stiffness; 93% returned to sport to their prior level. Mean range of motion was improved by 17 ° for wrist flexion (range, 15 ° to 30 °) and 15 ° for wrist extension (range, 10 ° to 25 °). All patients except 1 recovered grip strength, improving from 27 kg (range, 12-53) preoperatively to 35 kg (range, 17-61) at last-follow-up, and ulnar-sided pain was alleviated during golf practice. Return to prior sport level was possible by 5.5 months for professional players and by 9 months for amateurs.

Patients and methods:   Eighty-four consecutive men (66 ± 6.3 years) with a mean PSA level of 10.2 ± 7.4 ng/mL and at least one TZ-PI-RADS > 2 lesion were included. All patients had MRI-directed microUS and biopsy. Sensitivity and specificity of post-MRI microUS to visualize PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions, the cancer detection rate of TZ-sPCa, and tumor characteristics according to their visibility on microUS were evaluated. Interreader agreement for detecting microUS+ lesions was evaluated using Cohen's kappa test.  Results:   Of the 92 PI-RADS > 2 lesions, 71 (71/92; 77%) were visible on microUS and biopsy was performed without image fusion, which was required for the 21 invisible lesions (21/92; 22.8%). TZ-sPCa detection rate was 51.1% (47/92). Sensitivity and specificity of MRI-directed microUS were 83% (39/47; 95% CI: 69.2-92.4%) and 28.9% (13/45; 95% CI: 16.4-44.3%), on a per-lesion basis and 86.4% (38/45; 95% CI: 72.6-94.8%) and 27.5% (11/40; 95% CI: 14.6-43.9%) on a per-patient basis. Visible tumors on microUS exhibited a larger volume and a lower mean ADC value than non-visible tumors (15.8 ± 5.1 vs. 12.5 ± 3.6 mm and 0.82 ± 1.1 × 103 vs. 0.9 ± 1.4 × 10-3 mm2/s) (p = 0.02). Non-visible tumors showed a heterogeneous non-specific echotexture or were masked by the shadowing caused by corpora amylacea. Interreader agreement was almost perfect (kappa = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95). The main limitation is the single-center feature of the study.  Conclusion:   MRI-targeted transrectal microUS is effective to detect TZ-sPCa. TRUS-MRI image fusion helps overcome limitations due to TZ tissue heterogeneity.  Key points:   microUS can visualize the majority of MRI-detected PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions (sensitivity = 83%). Interreader agreement of MRI-directed microUS in the detection of TZ lesions appears excellent (kappa = 0.88). In 77% of PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions, biopsy was performed under microUS visual control.

Pegfilgrastim was approved in Japan in November 2014 to prevent febrile neutropenia (FN) and maintain RDI.In this retrospective study, we reviewed 334 patients with DLBCL who received 6 or more courses of R-CHOP and analyzed the differences in the RDI, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival between patients whose treatment started after November 2014 (postapproval group) and those whose treatment started before October 2014 (pre-approval group).The incidence of FN was lower (20% vs 38.3%, P < .001) and the RDI of R-CHOP was higher (86.8% vs 67.8%, P < .001) in the postapproval group. Pegfilgrastim was administered to many of these patients (76.8%) and was thought to have contributed to the high RDI maintenance in the postapproval group. Interrupted time-series analysis showed a significant rise of the RDI at the timing of pegfilgrastim approval in patients aged <70 years (estimated change: 18.1%, P < .001). The 5-year OS (85.7% vs 69.9%, P = .009) and progression-free survival (81.4% vs 64.4%, P = .011) were superior in the postapproval group. However, the differences were not significant in matched-pair analysis matching National Comprehensive Cancer Network-International Prognostic Index scores. Improved survival outcomes in this group were observed only among patients with Ann Arbor stage 3/4 (5-year OS: 83.7% vs 61.3%, P = .019) and high-risk on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-International Prognostic Index (5-year OS: 80.7% vs 32.4%, P = .014). Multivariate analysis showed that a high RDI and low lactate dehydrogenase were associated with superior OS (RDI ≥ 85%, hazard ratio: 0.48, P = .016; lactate dehydrogenase > institutional upper limit of normal, hazard ratio: 2.38, P = .005).The RDI of R-CHOP was able to be maintained at higher levels, the incidence of FN was lower, and significantly better clinical outcomes were achieved in clinically high-risk groups after pegfilgrastim approval.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the adverse reactions on blood coagulation of the administered pegylated Escherichia coli (E coli) asparaginase (PEG-ASP) to the NK/TL patients. Clinical data of 71 NK/TL patients (range 13-73 years), who received 239 cycles of chemotherapy treatment containing PEG-ASP in the Hematology Department of Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital of China from January 2016 to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Data of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FBG), and antithrombinIII (ATIII) were obtained at the time points routinely and statistically analyzed. There were statistical differences between the monitored parameters of baseline day0 (the day before use of PEG-ASP, named day0) and those of day3 (the 3rd day after treatment) to day6, and data showed all of the indicators could recover within 21 days. The events included PT prolonged in 33 patients (46.5%), APPT prolonged in 41 patients (57.7%, 20 patients with APTT >60 seconds), FBG decreased in 49 patients (69.0%, 12 patients with FBG <1 g/L), and ATIII decreased in 52 patients (73.2%). The patients' average number of cycles received was 2.3 for PT (>14 seconds), 2.5 for APTT (>35 seconds), 2.7 for FBG (<2 g/L), and 2.6 for D-dimer (>550 ng/mL). Compared with those at day0, PT and APTT prolonged sharply at day3 (P < .05), reached the peak at day12, maintained the prolonged level from day3 to day15, and gradually recovered at day 21. FBG and ATIII significantly decreased at day6 and day3 respectively (P < .05), both of them fell to the minimum at day12, and then returned the normal. The D-dimer levels were no significantly change during the whole treatment course. The APTT >60 seconds or FBG <1 g/L side effects were improved by symptomatic treatment of supplementation of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate infusion, no concomitant bleeding or thrombotic events emerging.

Methods:   Clinicopathological data on 62 SNADETs in 58 patients who underwent preoperative M-NBI/M-AANBI and endoscopic resection were retrospectively reviewed. The pathological results were classified into two categories, LGA and HGA/AC. We evaluated microvascular patterns (MVPs) and microsurface patterns (MSPs) observed by M-NBI and MSPs observed by M-AANBI for characterizing LGA and HGA/AC. The kappa value was calculated to assess the interobserver and intraobserver agreements of evaluation of M-AANBI images.  Results:   Pathologically, 38 lesions (61.3%) were LGA and 24 lesions (38.7%) were HGA/AC. HGA/AC tended to have irregular MVP and/or MSP on M-NBI. M-NBI diagnostic performance to distinguish HGA/AC from LGA showed 62.5% sensitivity, 68.4% specificity, and 66.1% accuracy. SNADETs had irregular MSP on M-AANBI. Three irregularity grades (iG) of MSP were observed by M-AANBI as follows: iG1, mild; iG2, moderate; iG3, significant. HGA/AC lesions had a significantly higher rate of iG3 than LGA lesions (p < 0.001). The iG2 was associated with HGA/AC in elevated lesions and LGA in depressed lesions. The diagnostic performance of M-AANBI was as follows: 95.8% sensitivity, 97.4% specificity, and 96.8% accuracy. The diagnostic accuracy of M-AANBI was significantly higher than that of M-NBI (p < 0.001). The kappa value for interobserver agreement on the diagnosis and irregularity grading of M-AANBI images was 0.742 and 0.719, respectively. These data indicate substantial interobserver agreement.

The clinical features have not been fully identified because clinical data on intracranial failure after HA-WBRT are limited. It is thus necessary to accumulate clinical data.We retrospectively analyzed cancer patients with brain metastases who were diagnosed between January 2014 and September 2020 at a regional referral hospital. The medical records of patients who underwent HA-WBRT were reviewed. The clinical features of intracranial recurrence were described. Dosimetry parameters were compared in terms of deviation from the recommended protocol of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Report 0933.Twenty-four eligible patients with brain metastases who underwent HA-WBRT were identified; 13 (54%) were male. Seventeen patients (71%) had lung cancer, 6 (25%) had breast cancer, and 1 (4%) had liver cancer. The median overall survival was 12 months. Three patients developed intracranial failure during clinical follow-up, and 2 relapsed with intracranial failure in the perihippocampal region at 13 and 22 months, respectively. The perihippocampal failure rate was about 8%.

One of the frequently encountered complication with this surgery is erosion of the acetabular cartilage. This study was conducted to investigate acetabular erosion after BHA according to the difference in diameter between femoral head and implanted cup at minimum 10-year follow-up.We retrospectively reviewed 117 patients (117 hips) undergoing BHA with fracture of neck of the femur. Their mean age was 77.8 years (range, 65-96 years) and male: female ratio was 32:85. Patients were divided into 3 groups; Group A - bipolar cup size > actual head size, Group B - cup size < head size, Group C - cup size = head size. The degree of both superior and medial acetabular cartilage erosion was identified and calculated on postoperative radiographs using line of acetabular margin and Kohler line.The mean superior and medial acetabular erosion were 1.62 ± 1.6 mm (range, 0-4.4) and 4.15 ± 2.7 mm (range, 0-8.2) in Group A, 1.30 ± 1.3 mm (range, 0-3.8) and 4.11 ± 2.7 mm (range, 0-7.8) in Group B, and 0.90 ± 1.1 mm (range, 0-2.6) and 3.16 ± 2.9 mm (range, 0-7.9) in Group C (P = .039 and P = .187, respectively).

The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Solitaire AB stent thrombectomy for acute cerebral infarction (ACI).  Methods:   A retrospective study was carried out in 96 ACI patients admitted to our department from January 2017 to January 2020. According to the treatment they received, they were divided into group A (conventional microcatheter mechanical thrombectomy, n = 48) and group B (Solitaire AB stent thrombectomy, n = 48). All patients were followed up for 3 months. Their pre- and post-operative nerve function indices were compared between the 2 groups. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale system, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and modified Rankin scale statistics.  Results:   Two groups of patients with NIHSS scores postoperative 3 and 30 days decreased significantly compared with preoperation. NIHSS score of group A 3 and 30 days postoperation was significantly higher than group B (P < .05).

Here, we investigated twelve patients with nephropathic cystinosis belonging to eight Tunisian families in order to analyze the clinical and genetic characteristics of Tunisian children with infantile nephropathic cystinosis.  Methods:   Clinical data were collected retrospectively. Molecular analysis of the CTNS gene was performed by Sanger sequencing.  Results:   We describe a new splicing mutation c.971-1G > C in the homozygous state in 6/12 patients which seems to be a founder mutation. The reported deletion of 23nt c.771_793 Del (p.Gly258Serfs*30) was detected in a homozygous state in one patient and in a heterozygous compound state with the c.971-1G > C mutation in 3/12 patients.

Methods:   Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models evaluated the association between lymph node variables based on MRI images and survival. Revisions for the N classification system were proposed and compared to the 8th edition AJCC staging system using Harrell's concordance index (C-index). The survival outcomes of induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and CCRT alone in patients with multiple CNNs were compared.  Results:   In 1319 patients enrolled, CNN was not an independent prognostic factor for the main survival outcomes, but multiple CNNs (three or more necrotic nodes) were independent prognostic factors for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.05; p = 0.020) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 1.78; p = 0.004), surpassing other nodal variables. On upgrading patients with multiple CNNs to revised N3 disease, the proposed N staging widened the differences in DMFS and PFS between N2 and N3 disease. The overall survival of patients with multiple CNNs who received CCRT plus induction chemotherapy was improved compared to that of those who received CCRT alone (76.1% vs. 55.7%; adjusted p = 0.030).  Conclusions:   Upgrading patients with multiple CNNs to stage N3 may improve prognostication of the current AJCC staging system. Multiple CNNs might be a potential marker for stratifying patients who would benefit from induction chemotherapy.

This study aims to retrospectively analyze patients with prenatally diagnosed CDCs to identify the optimal timing of operative correction and the importance of cyst size as a predictor of the appearance of symptoms related to the CDC.  Methods:   We reviewed 125 patients with a prenatal diagnosis of CDC who were admitted to Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center from July 2015 to July 2020. After dividing the patients into a symptomatic group (n = 37) and an asymptomatic group (n = 88), according to whether they had any clinical symptoms at the time of their operation, we compared their clinical data and postoperative outcomes. The asymptomatic group was divided into a <1 month group; a ≥1 month and <4 months group; and a ≥4 months group according to their postnatal age at operation; postoperative complications of the three groups were then compared. We were also interested in the effect of cyst size (width and length) for predicting the development of symptoms related to the CDC.  Results:   The time of onset of symptoms after birth was mainly concentrated in the first 3 months (48.6%). The median width and length of cysts measured by preoperative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the symptomatic group were greater than those in the asymptomatic group (43 mm vs 28 mm and 71 mm vs 45 mm, respectively; P < .05). The serum levels of the liver-related enzymes ALT, AST, and GGT, and the serum level of DBIL, were greater in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group (P < .05). The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and duration of postoperative hospital stay in the symptomatic group were greater than those in the asymptomatic group (P < .05). In the asymptomatic group, there were no statistically significant differences in the surgical data and postoperative complications between the <1 month group, the ≥1 month and <4 months group, and the ≥4 months group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the length of the cyst in predicting symptoms was 0.747, the best cut-off point was 5.2 cm, and the sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 70%, respectively. The AUROC of the width of the cyst was 0.704, the best cut-off point was 4.1 cm, and the sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 75%, respectively.  Conclusion:   We maintain that it is advantageous to receive surgical treatment in the asymptomatic period for patients with a prenatally diagnosed CDC. A cyst size of length >5.2 cm and width >4.1 cm suggested that clinical symptoms might appear, and that surgery should be carried out as soon as possible, even in the neonatal period.""","""['Xisi Guan', 'Junting Li', 'Zhe Wang', 'Jixiao Zeng', 'Wei Zhong', 'Jiakang Yu']""","""["" Department of Neonatal Surgery, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ' Department of Pediatric Surgery, Shaoguan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Shaoguan, Guangdong, China.', "" Department of Pediatric Surgery, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.""]""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Sci""","""['Timing of surgery for prenatally diagnosed asymptomatic choledochal cysts: a prospective randomized study.', 'The in-utero diagnosis of choledochal cyst: can postnatal imaging predict benefit from early surgical intervention?', 'Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prenatal Diagnosis of Choledochal Cysts: A Single-Center Retrospective Analysis.', 'Prenatally diagnosed choledochal cysts: observation or early surgery?', 'Different characteristics of infants diagnosed with congenital choledochal malformation prenatally or postnatally.', 'Choledochal Cyst Excision in Infants-A Retrospective Study.']"""

Our study aims to analyze the correlation between BMD of different sites and LDD in postmenopausal women, and explore the potential pathophysiological mechanism of them.One hundred ninety-five postmenopausal female patients were enrolled and divided into osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal bone mass groups. Their BMD and lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively analyzed. Two spine surgeons were selected to assess LDD according to Pfirrmann grading system.Based on lumbar BMD, LDD of normal bone mass group was more severe than the other 2 groups in L1/2 and L2/3 segments (P < .05). Based on hip BMD, LDD of each disc from L1/2 to L5/S1 had no significant difference among the 3 groups (P > .05). Lumbar BMD (L1-L4) was positively correlated with corresponding degree of LDD (L1/2-L4/5) (P < .05), whereas there was no correlation between hip BMD and degree of LDD (P = .328).There is a positive correlation between lumbar BMD and LDD in postmenopausal women, which is more obvious in the upper lumbar spinal segments (L1, L2).

Methods:   This retrospective study used 10 quantitative indices to capture subjective perceptions of radiologists regarding image layout and position of chest radiographs, including the chest edges, field of view (FOV), clavicles, rotation, scapulae, and symmetry. An automated assessment system was developed using a training dataset consisting of 1025 adult posterior-anterior chest radiographs. The evaluation steps included: (i) use of a CNN framework based on ResNet - 34 to obtain measurement parameters for quantitative indices and (ii) analysis of quantitative indices using a multiple linear regression model to obtain predicted scores for the layout and position of chest radiograph. In the testing dataset (n = 100), the performance of the automated system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute difference (MAD), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).  Results:   The stepwise regression showed a statistically significant relationship between the 10 quantitative indices and subjective scores (p < 0.05). The deep learning model showed high accuracy in predicting the quantitative indices (ICC = 0.82 to 0.99, r = 0.69 to 0.99, MAD = 0.01 to 2.75). The automatic system provided assessments similar to the mean opinion scores of radiologists regarding image layout (MAPE = 3.05%) and position (MAPE = 5.72%).  Conclusions:   Ten quantitative indices correlated well with the subjective perceptions of radiologists regarding the image layout and position of chest radiographs. The automated system provided high performance in measuring quantitative indices and assessing image quality.

Some preoperative risk factors (RF) have been postulated; however, few studies have evaluated these factors and the intraoperative complexity with the COS rate. The aim of the study was to evaluate the preoperative RF and intraoperative complexity using the Parkland grading scale (PGS) with the COS rate in LC.  Methods:   A retrospective study was done evaluating the demographic and surgical variables from the patients and LC videos from 8 different hospitals of Mexico City from December 2018 to January 2020. The evaluation of the PGS was done by 2 surgeons (one MI and one HPB surgeon); the PGS was also categorized as Non-Complex LC (nCLC, PGS1-2) and Complex LC (CLC, PGS 3-5). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of this factors with the COS rate.  Results:   430 LC were analyzed; 358 (78.61%) were women, 261 (60.7%) were elective and 169(39.3%) urgent LC, the mean age was 44.06 (SD ± 13.16) years. 21 (4.8%) LC were COS; the mean age of this group was 55 (SD ± 12.95), 3 (0.7%) were nCLC and 18 (4.19%) CLC, mean PGS of 3.76 (SD ± 1.09), the mean time to COS was 48.67 (SD ± 41.9), the estimated blood loss (EBL) was 258 (SD ± 260.22) and 6 (1.4%) intraoperative BDI were recognized on this group. Univariate analysis showed a significant association with the COS with male sex, older age, age > 45 years, presence of comorbidities, a higher PGS, a CLC, higher EBL and possible BDI; multivariate analysis produced a model using male sex, age, presence of comorbidities and a CLC with a 0.809 area under the ROC curve.

Methods:   The data from 105 newly diagnosed adult ITP patients administered with first-line of steroid treatment from October 2016 to May 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment responses were evaluated within 3 months after the onset of treatment.  Results:   Among the 105 patients, 80.00% (84/105) of patients presented with platelet glycoprotein-specific antibody positive; 44.76% (47/105) patients were anti-P-selectin positive, while 35.24% (37/105) were anti-P-selectin negative.

The etiology of the disease is still unknown. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte to HDL cholesterol ratio (MHR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have all been reported as inflammatory markers in recent studies. However, these inflammatory markers have not been explored in SD patients. This study aimed to explore inflammatory and hematological parameters in SD patients with healthy controls (HCs) and evaluate their possible relationship with disease severity.  Materials and methods:   One hundred patients who presented to our hospital were diagnosed with SD and 74 HCs were retrospectively included in our study. The seborrheic dermatitis area severity index (SDASI) score was used to assess the severity of the SD.  Results:   The patient group's mean PLR, MPV ve CRP levels were statistically significantly higher than the HCs (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the patients compared with the control group regarding RDW, NLR, MHR, and SII levels (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between NLR, PLR, MPV, monocyte/HDL cholesterol, SII levels with age, and SDASI in the patient group. There was a significant correlation between CRP with age and RDW with SDASI score.  Conclusion:   Hematological parameters and CRP are low-cost tests.

Sixty patients were treated by the same surgeon between 2008 and 2018, 30 of them receiving only standard umbilical transposition abdominoplasty (A group), and 30 having concurrent monsplasty (AM group), namely skin excess removal, pubic suspension and skin redistribution following superolateral vectors, re-establishment of superficial fascia continuity, with or without liposuction. Retrospective comparison of the two groups included: a subjective evaluation through administration of questionnaires (BODY-QTM, a questionnaire assessing functional and aesthetic improvements after surgery, a questionnaire assessing the overall satisfaction), and an objective evaluation of pre- and post-operative pictures to estimate mons pubis suspension and result stability. Four minor complications were recorded: 1 wound dehiscence in A group, 3 seromas in AM group. All measured outcomes were higher in AM group, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in almost all the questionnaire and BODY-QTM items, and the photographic assessment confirmed higher degree of mons pubis suspension and superior result stability in AM group. We presented a standardized approach to mons pubis reshaping during abdominoplasty, through a straightforward, safe and quick procedure. Our experience supports the significance of the concomitant correction of abdominal and mons pubis deformities, improving the results of the surgery from both a subjective and objective point of view.""","""['Pierfranco Simone', 'Luca Savani', 'Paolo Marchica', 'Paolo Persichetti']""","""[' Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Campus Bio-Medico of Rome University, Rome, Italy.', ' Clinic of Plastic Surgery, Department of Neuroscience, Padua University Hospital, Padua, Italy.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""J Plast Surg Hand Surg""","""['Safe monsplasty technique.', 'Monsplasty after massive weight loss: Assessment of its aesthetic and functional impact.', 'Using superficial fascial system suspension for the management of the mons pubis after massive weight loss.', 'Mons Pubis Lift (Monsplasty).', 'Abdominal Contouring and Combining Procedures.']"""

Purpose:   To investigate the agreement of rs-CVR and the CVR mapping with breath-hold MRI (bh-CVR) in patients with gliomas.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Twenty-five patients (12 males, 13 females; mean age ± SD, 48 ± 13 years) with gliomas.  Field strength/sequence:   Dynamic T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging during a breath-hold paradigm and during the rs on a 3-T scanner.  Assessment:   rs-CVR with various frequency ranges and resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA) were assessed. The agreement between each rs-based CVR measurement and bh-CVR was determined by voxel-wise correlation and Dice coefficient in the whole brain, gray matter, and the lesion region of interest (ROI).  Statistical tests:   Voxel-wise Pearson correlation, Dice coefficient, Fisher Z-transformation, repeated-measure analysis of variance and post hoc test with Bonferroni correction, and nonparametric repeated-measure Friedman test and post hoc test with Bonferroni correction were used. Significance was set at P < 0.05.  Results:   Compared with bh-CVR, the highest correlations were found at the frequency bands of 0.04-0.08 Hz and 0.02-0.04 Hz for rs-CVR in both whole brain and the lesion ROI. RSFA had significantly lower correlations than did rs-CVR of 0.02-0.04 Hz and a wider frequency range (0-0.1164 Hz). Significantly higher correlations and Dice coefficient were found in normal tissues than in the lesion ROI for all three methods.  Data conclusion:   The optimal frequency ranges for rs-CVR are determined by comparing with bh-CVR in patients with gliomas. The rs-CVR method outperformed the RSFA.

However, quantitative methods for estimating the severity of fibrosis due to lymphedema have not been established. We evaluated skin stiffness using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and aimed to identify stiffness-associated factors in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Methods and Results: Thirty-six women (mean age, 57.5 ± 1.78 years; range, 39-77 years) were retrospectively recruited for this study. The mid-arm and mid-forearm circumferences were measured. The percentage differences in arm and forearm circumferences were used as an indicator of the severity of lymphedema at the time of SWE measurement and the measurement taken when the symptoms were most severe. Not subcutaneous tissues but cutaneous tissues of the affected arm and forearm showed a significant increase in shear-wave velocity (SWV) compared with those of the unaffected side. However, SWV was not correlated with the severity of lymphedema as a percentage difference when symptoms were most severe. Body mass index and lymphedema duration showed no significant correlation with the SWV of cutaneous tissues on the affected upper extremities.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, consecutive patients with histologically proven PNENs underwent CEUS examination at the initial work-up between January 2010 and October 2020. Patients were randomly allocated to the training and test sets. Typical sonographic and enhanced images of PNENs were selected to fine-tune the SE-ResNeXt-50 network. A combined nomogram model was developed by incorporating the DL predictive probability with clinical factors using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The utility of the proposed model was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic, calibration, and decision curve analysis.  Results:   A total of 104 patients were evaluated, including 80 (mean age ± standard deviation, 47 years ± 12; 56 males) in the training set and 24 (50 years ± 12; 14 males) in the test set. The DL model displayed effective image recognition with an AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.62-1.00) in the test set. The combined nomogram model that incorporated independent clinical risk factors, such as tumor size, arterial enhancement level, and DL predictive probability, showed strong discrimination, with an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.69-1.00) in the test set with good calibration. Decision curve analysis verified the clinical usefulness of the combined nomogram.  Conclusions:   The combined nomogram model could serve as a preoperative, noninvasive, and precise evaluation tool to differentiate aggressive and non-aggressive PNENs.  Key points:   • Tumor size (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; p = 0.02), arterial enhancement level (OR, 0.04; p = 0.008), and deep learning predictive probability (OR, 288.46; p < 0.001) independently predicted aggressiveness of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms preoperatively. • The combined model predicted aggressiveness better than the clinical model (AUC: 0.97 vs. 0.87, p = 0.009), achieving AUC values of 0.97 and 0.85 in the training set and the test set, respectively.""","""['Jingzhi Huang', 'Xiaohua Xie', 'Hong Wu', 'Xiaoer Zhang', 'Yanling Zheng', 'Xiaoyan Xie', 'Yi Wang', 'Ming Xu']""","""[' Department of Medical Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', ' National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Key Laboratory for Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', ' Department of Medical Ultrasound, Division of Interventional Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No.58 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Guangzhou, 510080, China. xuming8@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']""","""2022""","""2022 Nov""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'A Combined Nomogram Model to Preoperatively Predict Histologic Grade in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Development and validation of a simple-to-use nomogram to predict liver metastasis in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: a large cohort study.', 'Preoperative Prediction of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Grading Based on Enhanced Computed Tomography Imaging: Validation of Deep Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Radiomic nomogram based on MRI to predict grade of branching type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a multicenter study.']"""

Purpose:   To establish an accelerated MRI protocol targeting the table time of 15 minutes for pancreatic cancer surveillance and test its performance in lesion characterization.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population:   A total of 30 participants were enrolled, who were undergoing follow-up care for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or newly diagnosed pancreatic cysts (≥10 mm) and were scheduled for or had recently undergone contrast-enhanced CT (CECT).  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T; heavily T2WI, 3D MRCP, DWI, dynamic T1WI, two-point Dixon.  Assessment:   In-room time and table time were measured. Seven radiologists independently reviewed image quality of MRI and then the presence of high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in addition to diagnostic confidence for accelerated MRI, CECT, and the noncontrast part of accelerated MRI (NC-MRI).  Statistical analysis:   Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and either the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was performed for continuous variables. The generalized estimated equation was used to compare the diagnostic performance of examinations on a per-patient basis. Interobserver agreement was evaluated via Fleiss kappa. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.  Results:   The in-room time was 18.5 ± 2.6 minutes (range: 13.7-24.9) and the table time was 13.9 ± 1.9 minutes (range: 10.7-17.5). There was no significant difference between the diagnostic performances of the three examinations (pooled sensitivity: 75% for accelerated MRI and CECT, 68% for NC-MRI, P = 0.95), with the highest significant diagnostic confidence for accelerated MRI (4.2 ± 0.1). With accelerated MRI, the interobserver agreement was fair to excellent for high-risk stigmata (κ = 0.34-0.98).

Methods:   Three radiology residents with minimal experience in bladder MRI served as readers. They blindly evaluated 200 studies divided into 4 subsets of 50 cases over a 3-month period. After 2 months, the first subset was reassessed, resulting in a total of 250 evaluations. An interactive training program was provided and included educational lessons and case-based practice. The learning curve was constructed by plotting mean agreement as the ratio of correct evaluations per batch. Inter-reader agreement and diagnostic performance analysis were performed with kappa statistics and ROC analysis.  Results:   As for the VI-RADS scoring agreement, the kappa differences between pre-training and post-training evaluation of the same group of cases were 0.555 to 0.852 for reader 1, 0.522 to 0.695 for reader 2, and 0.481 to 0.794 for reader 3.

To address this, the North American Consensus (NAC) group published evidence-based recommendations for HMBT.  Aims:   To evaluate results obtained using NAC recommendations for HMBT, compared to retrospective data that utilized guidelines previously recommended.  Methods:   HMBT data from 725 patients referred for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and/or carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) testing were analyzed. Data were compared regarding dose of substrate for SIBO testing (16 vs. 10 g lactulose, and 50 vs. 75 g glucose) and the effect of post-ingestion sampling period for malabsorption testing. The effect of different recommended cut-off values for SIBO were examined.  Results:   Substrate dose did not affect methane production. 10 g lactulose significantly reduced positive SIBO results compared to 16 g lactulose (42 vs. 53%, p = 0.04). 75 g glucose significantly increased positive results compared to 50 g glucose (36 vs. 22%, p = 0.04). Provoked symptoms were significantly more prevalent in patients testing positive by both North American Consensus and Ledochowski cut-off values. 34.5% of patients tested positive for CM at 180-min compared to 28% at 120-min (not significant, p = 0.19).  Conclusions and inferences:   10 g lactulose substrate produces fewer positive SIBO results than 16 g lactulose, while 75 g glucose dose produces more positive SIBO results than 50 g. Performing CM breath tests for 180 min increases number of positive results when compared to 120 min.

Especially in severe cases with higher degrees of correction, a relevant overlap between the osteotomized fragment and the pelvis might occur, leading to necessary fragment translation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the necessary translation as a function of the degree of correction using a statistical mean model of the pelvis according to the technique (classic PAO or reverse PAO).  Methods:   A mean statistical shape model of the pelvis and 2 extreme models were used to simulate rotation of the osteotomized fragment during a classic or reverse PAO and to calculate rotations from -20° to 20° in the frontal, sagittal, and transverse planes and a combination thereof. The depth and volume of the intersection between the mobilized fragment and the pelvis were calculated, and the minimum translation of the fragment necessary to avoid segment overlap was determined.  Results:   The maximum intersection distances between the pelvis and the 20° rotated fragment were 6.7 and 15.3 mm for adduction and abduction (frontal plane), 6.4 and 4.5 mm for internal and external rotation (transverse plane), and 27.8 and 9.2 mm for extension and flexion (sagittal plane). The necessary translations for 20° of fragment rotation were 7.0 and 12.8 mm for adduction and abduction (frontal plane), 4.8 and 5.0 mm for internal and external rotation (transverse plane), and 18.5 mm and 8.8 mm for extension and flexion (sagittal plane).  Conclusions:   Acetabular reorientation with the classic or reverse PAO results in translation of the fragment and in a consequent change in the rotational center. This finding is more pronounced with higher degrees of fragment reorientation in abduction and extension; it becomes especially pronounced in reverse PAO for acetabular retroversion or protrusio acetabuli, and might limit the ability to achieve the intended improvement in overall hip biomechanics.""","""['Philipp Kriechling', 'Laura Leoty', 'Philipp Fürnstahl', 'Dana Rahbani', 'Patrick O Zingg', 'Lazaros Vlachopoulos']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedics, Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.', ' Research in Orthopaedic Computer Science (ROCS), Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', ' Graphics and Vision Research Group (GraVis), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jun""","""J Bone Joint Surg Am""","""['Is Anterior Rotation of the Acetabulum Necessary to Normalize Joint Contact Pressure in Periacetabular Osteotomy?

Clinical data were collected and compared between the 2 groups.The geriatric group had a higher incidence of trauma and higher Injury Severity Scores than did the nongeriatric group. Fewer geriatric patients underwent surgical treatment (all patients: geriatric vs nongeriatric: 65.9% vs 70.7%; patients with severe trauma: geriatric vs nongeriatric: 27.6% vs 44.5%).

Methods:   This was a retrospective study, including patients with FED and cataract who underwent either F-DMEK (16 eyes of 15 patients) or manual DMEK (M-DMEK) (42 eyes of 37 patients) combined with cataract extraction. Outcome measures included visual acuity, graft detachment, graft survival, and endothelial cell loss.  Results:   The average follow-up in F-DMEK and M-DMEK was 57.1 ± 12.4 months and 58.5 ± 17.3 months, respectively ( P = 0.757). The rates of primary failure (0% vs. 9.5%, P = 0.567), secondary failure (0% for both), and graft rejection (0% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.533) did not differ significantly between the groups. Improvement in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was similar in F-DMEK and M-DMEK (0.32 ± 0.27 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and 0.35 ± 0.44 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, respectively, P = 0.165) and persisted at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years and at the last follow-up. The rates of graft detachment and rebubbling were significantly lower with 6.25% in F-DMEK and 33.3% in M-DMEK ( P = 0.035). Cell-loss rates were lower in F-DMEK compared with M-DMEK throughout the follow-up, significantly so up to 2 years with a difference of 8.6% at 1 year ( P = 0.023), 11.8% at 2 years ( P = 0.021), 7.6% at 3 years ( P = 0.088), 5.8% at 4 years ( P = 0.256), 13.6% at 5 years ( P = 0.169), and 7.1% at the final follow-up ( P = 0.341).

The impact of sex on the use of invasive cardiac angiography (ICA) after vasodilator stress cardiac MRI is unclear.  Purpose:   To evaluate the impact of sex on ICA use after vasodilator stress cardiac MRI.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 6229 consecutive patients (age [mean ± standard deviation] 65.2 ± 11.5 years, 38.1% women).  Field strength/sequence:   A 5-T; a steady-state free-precession cine sequence; stress first-pass perfusion imaging; late enhancement imaging.  Assessment:   Patients underwent vasodilator stress cardiac MRI for known or suspected CCS. The ischemic burden (at stress first-pass perfusion imaging) was computed (17-segment model).  Statistical tests:   Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the potential differential association between ischemic burden and use of cardiac MRI-related ICA across sex.  Results:   A total of 1109 (17.8%) patients were referred to ICA, among which there were significantly more men (762, 19.7%) than women (347, 14.6%). Overall, after multivariate adjustment, female sex was not associated with lower use of ICA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; confidence interval [CI] 95%: 0.84-1.18, P = 0.934). However, significant sex differences were detected across ischemic burden. Whereas women with nonischemic vasodilator stress cardiac MRI (0 ischemic segments) were less commonly submitted to ICA (OR = 0.49; CI 95%: 0.35-0.69) in patients with ischemia (>1 ischemic segment), adjusted use of ICA was more frequent in women than men (OR = 1.27; CI 95%: 1.1-1.5).  Data conclusions:   In patients with known or suspected CCS submitted to undergo vasodilator stress cardiac MRI, cardiac MRI-related ICA may be overused in men without ischemia.

High cut-off (HCO) and medium cut-off (MCO) dialysis membrane and cytokine adsorber (CytoSorb®) have been used to this purpose in clinical practice. The data on comparative effectiveness of those methods are scarce.  Methods:   In this single-center retrospective study, we included patients with AKI and concomitant rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin &gt;20,000 μg/L), who underwent at least one extracorporeal myoglobin removal procedure. The main outcome parameter was myoglobin reduction ratio, whereas albumin was assessed as a safety parameter.  Results:   We analyzed data for 15 patients, who underwent 28 procedures (13 HCO, 9 MCO, and 6 adsorber). Pre-treatment serum myoglobin levels were similar between the groups and myoglobin reduction was significant in HCO (p = 0.03) and MCO groups (p &lt; 0.01) and borderline significant in adsorber group (p = 0.06). Reduction ratios were comparable between the groups (median 0.64 (inter-quartile range IQR 0.13-0.72), 0.54 (IQR 0.51-0.61) and 0.50 (IQR 0.37-0.62), respectively, p = 0.83). Both pre- and post-procedure serum albumin levels were significantly lower in the MCO group. However, with routine albumin substitution in the HCO group only, serum albumin remained stable during the procedures in all subgroups.  Conclusions:   Novel MCO membrane might represent the optimal mode of treatment of severe rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, as it allows for efficient removal of myoglobin, avoids albumin supplementation and is associated with lower costs.

This is inherently linked to the process of myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification and impacts MBF accuracy but to an unclear extent.  Purpose:   To assess the impact of temporal resolution on quantitative perfusion and compare approaches for accounting for its variability.  Study type:   Prospective phantom and retrospective clinical study.  Population and phantom:   Simulations, a cardiac perfusion phantom, and 30 patients with (16, 53%) or without (14, 47%) coronary artery disease.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0 T/2D saturation recovery spoiled gradient echo sequence.  Assessment:   Dynamic perfusion data were simulated for a range of reference MBF (1 mL/g/min-5 mL/g/min) and HR (30 bpm-150 bpm). Perfusion imaging was performed in patients and a phantom for different temporal resolutions. MBF and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) were quantified without correction for temporal resolution or following correction by either MBF scaling based on the sampling interval or data interpolation prior to quantification. Simulated data were quantified using Fermi deconvolution, truncated singular value decomposition, and one-compartment modeling, whereas phantom and clinical data were quantified using Fermi deconvolution alone.  Statistical tests:   Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality, percentage error (PE) for measuring MBF accuracy in simulations, and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction to compare clinical MBF and MPR. Statistical significance set at P < 0.05.  Results:   For Fermi deconvolution and an example simulated 1 mL/g/min, the MBF PE without correction for temporal resolution was between 55.4% and -62.7% across 30-150 bpm. PE was between -22.2% and -6.8% following MBF scaling and between -14.2% and -14.2% following data interpolation across the same HR. An interpolated HR of 240 bpm reduced PE to ≤10%. Clinical rest and stress MBF and MPR were significantly different between analyses.  Data conclusion:   Accurate perfusion quantification needs to account for the variability of temporal resolution, with data interpolation prior to quantification reducing MBF variability across different resolutions.

Coping with a chronic ailment is a long-term process, which also depends on the personality of the individual. One important personality resource is ego-resiliency, that is, how flexible the person is in adapting to the impulse to control their environment.  Purpose:   The aim of the study was to determine whether ego-resiliency affects the perceived level of tinnitus annoyance.  Research design:   This was a questionnaire study combined with a retrospective analysis of medical data.  Study sample:   The study involved 176 people with diagnosed chronic tinnitus who volunteered to participate (53 men and 123 women aged 31-80 years).  Data collection and analysis:   The following tools were used: Ego-Resiliency Scale to measure ego-resiliency, Tinnitus Functional Index to assess the impact of tinnitus on daily life, and a survey of sociodemographics and tinnitus history.  Results:   The conducted research showed that men had higher ego-resiliency than women. Older subjects (older than 60 years) had higher ego-resiliency than younger ones. There was a negative correlation between ego-resiliency and the perceived annoyance of tinnitus. Regression analysis showed that a person's ability to cope and to tolerate negative emotions were the only factors of ego-resiliency that were a significant predictor of tinnitus annoyance.  Conclusion:   People with a high level of personal ability to cope and to tolerate negative emotions are likely to experience decreased tinnitus annoyance. Ego-resiliency levels should be considered when diagnosing and planning interventions for people with tinnitus. In psychological intervention programs for people with tinnitus, it is worthwhile developing ego-resiliency, paying particular attention to positive emotions which are crucial in building it.

However, the clinical value and applicability of EUS-PPG measurement in predicting histologically advanced hepatic fibrosis remain unknown.  Methods:   This was a single-center retrospective study on patients with various CLDs undergoing EUS-PPG and EUS-guided liver biopsy (EUS-bx) to assess if EUS-PPG measurements correlate with histological fibrosis stage and various surrogate markers for severity of CLDs and its safety. Cases with EUS-PPG were identified at the University of California Irvine, a tertiary endoscopy center, between January 2014 and March 2020.  Results:   In 64 patients, the mean age was 57.5; 40 (62.5%), males; mean Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, 5.9 and 10.4, respectively.

Patients and methods:   Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib 600 mg (n = 152) or crizotinib 250 mg (n = 151). cfDNA was quantified from baseline plasma samples, with patients stratified into ≤median and >median cfDNA biomarker-evaluable populations (BEP).

Results:   Median cfDNA concentration in the BEP was 11.53 ng/mL (n = 276). A positive correlation was found between cfDNA concentration and number of lesions, organ lesion sites, and tumor size (sum of longest diameter; all P < 0.0001).

Constrained prosthesis can be used for significant ligamentous laxity, but there is not much evidence on the appropriate level of restriction for unstable varus-valgus TKA. The objective of this study was to compare the outcome and survival at a minimum follow-up of five years between rotating hinge knee prosthesis (RHK) and constrained condylar knee prosthesis (CCK) for extension instability following primary TKA.  Hypothesis:   For symptomatic extension instability after primary TKA, good functional outcomes and survival can be achieved with both designs.  Material and methods:   Consecutive patients with unstable primary TKA who underwent revision with either RHK (n=34) or CCK (n=30) were retrospectively compared. Assessments were performed by the Knee Society Scores (KSS), and visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain and patient satisfaction. Radiological evaluation was made. Complications and re-operations were analyzed.  Results:   Mean post-operative follow-up was 10.3 (range 5-16) years for both groups. At the final follow-up, there was no significant difference between groups in the KSS-knee (p=0.228) or KSS-function (p=0.324) score, VAS-pain (p=0.563), VAS-satisfaction (p=0.780), major complication rate (p=0.194), or TKA survival at 10 years (p=0.091).

This study was undertaken to determine factors associated with negative resection margins.  Methods:   National Cancer Database was queried from 2010 to 2016 to identify patients with AJCC/ENSAT Stage I-III ACC who underwent adrenalectomy. Patient, tumor, facility, and operative characteristics were compared by margin status (positive-PM or negative-NM) and operative approach (open-OA, laparoscopic-LA, or robotic-RA). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with PM.  Results:   Eight hundred and eighty-one patients were identified, of which 18.4% had PM and 81.6% had NM. Patients with advanced pathologic T stage and pathologic N1 stage were more likely to have PM (vs. NM) (T3, 49.7% vs. 24.8%, p < 0.01; T4, 26.2% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.01; N1, 6.7% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.01).

We reviewed the records of 70 children with upper urinary tract stones who were treated with a mini-perc technique between July 2015 and April 2020. All puncture site selections and tract dilations were determined by Doppler ultrasonography. Patient age, height, weight, stone size, operation time, stone-free rate (SFR), postoperative complications, tubeless rate, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were recorded. Stone components were analysed using infrared spectroscopy. A total of 47 boys and 23 girls were included. Median weight and height of the patients were 18.5 kg and 110 cm, respectively. Median stone diameter was 2.0 cm. Median time to establish access was 4.0 min and median operation time was 25 min. Patients had median preoperative and postoperative haemoglobin levels of 121 and 113.5 g/L, median haemoglobin levels dropped to 8.0 g/L the day after surgery. No patient needed a blood transfusion. Eight children (11.4%) developed significant complications, including four cases with Clavien Grade I, one with Clavien Grade II, and three with Clavien Grade Ⅲ complications. One-day and 1-month follow-ups revealed a complete SFR of 95.7% (67/70) and 97.1% (68/70), respectively. Fifty-six patients (80.0%) did not require catheters of any type (total tubeless). Median LOS was 2.0 days. Ultrasound-guided mini-perc is safe and effective.

Objective:   To develop a new quantitative image marker computed from pre-intervention computed tomography perfusion (CTP) images and evaluate its feasibility to predict clinical outcome among AIS patients undergoing EMT after diagnosis of LVO.  Methods:   A retrospective dataset of 31 AIS patients with pre-intervention CTP images is assembled. A computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme is developed to pre-process CTP images of different scanning series for each study case, perform image segmentation, quantify contrast-enhanced blood volumes in bilateral cerebral hemispheres, and compute features related to asymmetrical cerebral blood flow patterns based on the cumulative cerebral blood flow curves of two hemispheres. Next, image markers based on a single optimal feature and machine learning (ML) models fused with multi-features are developed and tested to classify AIS cases into two classes of good and poor prognosis based on the Modified Rankin Scale. Performance of image markers is evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy computed from the confusion matrix.  Results:   The ML model using the neuroimaging features computed from the slopes of the subtracted cumulative blood flow curves between two cerebral hemispheres yields classification performance of AUC = 0.878±0.077 with an overall accuracy of 90.3%.

CMJ force-time asymmetries were measured over discrete movement phases (eccentric deceleration phase, concentric phase). Separate additive mixed effects models (additive mixed effects model [AMM]) were fit for each AI with a main effect for the surgical technique and a smooth term for the time since surgery (days). The models explained between 43% and 91% of the deviance in neuromuscular recovery after ACLR. The mean time course was generated from the AMM.

Methods:   This was a post hoc analysis of 65 pseudophakic subjects with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy who underwent DMEK surgery between December 2018 and April 2021 as part of the Advanced Visualization In Corneal Surgery Evaluation international multicenter randomized controlled trial. One eye per patient was included. Preoperatively and 1 day postoperatively, patients underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging. Using a grid consisting of 25 zones (ie, pachymetry map), corneal thickness and presence of a graft detachment were mapped for each patient. Detachments of any size were considered, regardless of subsequent clinical interventions. Missing data were imputed and subsequently divided into a training and test set. Two prediction methods were evaluated: one model based on absolute corneal thickness and a regression model.  Results:   A total of 65 eyes were included for analysis of which 33 developed any form of graft detachment. Preoperatively, no significant differences were observed between the groups ( P = 0.221). Corneal thickness in the corneal zones with a detached graft was significantly increased compared with corneal zones with an attached graft ( P < 0.001). The regression prediction model had an area under the curve of 0.87 (sensitivity: 0.79 and specificity: 0.75), whereas the absolute thickness cutoff model only reached 0.65.

Experimental design:   We established a multi-institutional dataset of previously treated patients with desmoid tumor across four U.S. sarcoma centers, including demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment regimens, and clinical and radiographic responses. CTNNB1 or APC mutation status was determined from prior pathology records, or archival tissue was requested and analyzed by Sanger sequencing and/or next-generation sequencing. Evaluable patients with mutation results were analyzed to determine clinical progression-free survival (cPFS), RECIST 1.1 PFS (rPFS), time to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed to identify differences in cPFS, rPFS, TTNT, and OS by mutation subtype, desmoid tumor location, and treatment regimen.  Results:   A total of 259 evaluable patients were analyzed for at least one of the survival outcomes, with 177 patients having mutation data. First- and second-line cPFS, rPFS, and TTNT were not significantly affected by mutation subtype; however, APC-mutant desmoid tumors demonstrated nonstatistically significant inferior outcomes. Extremity/trunk desmoid tumor location and treatment with doxorubicin-based, methotrexate/vinca alkaloids and sorafenib regimens were associated with better clinical outcomes compared with surgery or ""other"" therapies, including estrogen-receptor blockade and imatinib. OS was significantly worse with APC or CTNNB1 negative/other mutations.  Conclusions:   Mutation subtype did not affect responses to specific systemic therapies.

Currently, prognostic biomarkers for the detection and stratification of lung cancer are being investigated for clinical use. The surface protein cluster of differentiation 49b (CD49b) plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and invasion in different tumor entities and blocking CD49b improved the tumor immune response. Overexpression of CD49b has been associated with unfavorable survival rates in several malignant tumor entities, such as prostate cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the protein expression of CD49b in patients with different types of lung cancer and additionally to identify the influence of CD49b on clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival.Expression levels of CD49b were retrospective analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 92 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (AC), 85 cases of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQCLC) and 32 cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and patients' overall survival.A strong expression of CD49b was most seen in SQCLC (78%), followed by AC (48%) and SCLC (9%). All patients combined, strong expression of CD49b correlated significantly with poorer overall survival. However, an increased expression of CD49b correlated significantly with a poorer survival rate only in SQCLC. In AC and SCLC, no significant correlation could be demonstrated in this regard.In our study, CD49b expression was associated with poor overall survival in patients with SQCLC. Accordingly, CD49b could serve as a new prognostic biomarker and, moreover, be a potential new drug target in SQCLC.""","""['Anna Tirilomi', 'Omar Elakad', 'Sha Yao', 'Yuchan Li', 'Marc Hinterthaner', 'Bernhard C Danner', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Theodor Tirilomis', 'Hanibal Bohnenberger', 'Alexander von Hammerstein-Equord']""","""[' Department of Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, University Medical Center, Göttingen, Germany.', ' Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Göttingen, Germany.']""","""2022""","""2022 Feb""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene amplification and protein expression in human lung cancer.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'Expression and prognostic impact of alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked and death domain-associated protein in human lung cancer.', 'Role of Annexin A1 in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer Progression.', 'One carbon metabolism in human lung cancer.']"""

Development of scoliosis in pediatric AFM patients has been anecdotally reported, but associated risk factors or incidence have yet to be determined.  Methods:   Pediatric AFM patients treated over a 10-year period at a tertiary care center were identified. Patients were considered to have scoliosis if there was radiographic evidence of coronal curvature ≥15 degrees. Number of limbs affected, independent ambulation and head control, ventilator requirement at initial admission, and long-term ventilatory support (≥1 year) were recorded. Muscle strength and functional status were assessed by manual muscle testing (MMT) and Physical Abilities and Mobility Scale (PAMS), respectively.

Little information is known about the predictors for surgery after these bites.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 161 patients envenomed by N. atra, 80 of whom underwent surgery because of wound necrosis and infection. We compared the patients' variables between surgical and non-surgical groups. To construct a surgical risk score, we converted the regression coefficients of the significant factors in the multivariate logistic regression into integers. We also examined the deep tissue cultures and pathological findings of the debrided tissue.  Results:   A lower limb as the bite site, a ≥3 swelling grade, bullae or blister formation, gastrointestinal (GI) effects, and fever were significantly associated with surgery in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The surgical risk scores for these variables were 1, 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively. At a ≥3-point cutoff value, the model has 71.8% sensitivity and 88.5% specificity for predicting surgery, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88. The histopathological examinations of the debrided tissues supported the diagnosis of snakebite-induced NSTI. Twelve bacterial species were isolated during the initial surgery and eleven during subsequent surgeries.  Discussion and conclusions:   From the clinical perspective, swelling, bullae or blister formation, GI effects, and fever appeared quickly after the bite and before surgery. The predictive value of these factors for surgery was acceptable, with a ≥3-point risk score. The common laboratory parameters did not always predict the outcomes of N. atra bites without proper wound examination.

Methods:   All patients operated on at 8 Italian cardiac surgery centres in the period 2009-2019 with available data for the calculation of EuroSCORE II and ACEF II were included in the study. Mortality was recorded and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for the overall study population and for different patient subgroups according to the type of surgery.  Results:   A total of 14 804 patients were enrolled [median age of 70 (62-77) years, 35.4% female], and among these, 3.1% underwent emergency surgery. Thirty-day mortality was 2.84% (n = 420).

Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing pIOL explantation with corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) <2000 cells/mm 2 at the time of the procedure were retrospectively reviewed in a single tertiary center. All patients were treated between April 2016 and October 2020 at a high-volume referral-based tertiary hospital. The primary outcome was the change in corneal endothelial parameters, including ECD, over long-term follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in corrected distance visual acuity and analysis of prognostic factors.  Results:   This study included 44 eyes from 28 patients with an average age of 42.5 ± 7.8 years (range: 27-63). Mean ECD before explantation was 1375.4 ± 468.2 cells/mm 2 (range: 622-1996), and the average duration of follow-up after explantation was 20.5 months (6-58.2). Two years after explantation, ECD had significantly decreased by more than 25% to 1019.6 ± 368.6 (608-1689; P < 0.01). However, there was no significant change in corrected distance visual acuity (20/23-20/22, P = 0.59).

The FDG uptake of SPN was evaluated using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on PET/CT. The mean Hounsfield unit (HU) for each SPN was evaluated over the region of interest on nonenhanced and enhanced CT images. The change in mean HU (HUpeak-pre) was quantified by subtracting the mean HU of the preenhanced CT from that of the post-enhanced CT. TDR was defined as the ratio of the tumor area, which disappears at a mediastinal window, to the tumor area of the lung window.

However, the formation of esophageal stricture after ESD is one of its important complications. In this paper, we intend to identify the risk factors of esophageal stricture to develop a nomogram model to predict the risk of esophageal stricture and validate this model.A total, 159 patients were included in this study, including 21 patients with esophageal stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age greater than 60 years, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, the extent of esophageal mucosal defect greater than 1/2, and postoperative pathological type of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were independent risk factors for predicting esophageal stricture. We constructed a nomogram model to predict esophageal stenosis by these 4 independent predictors.The prediction performance of the model was verified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.889, and the sensitivity and specificity were 80.00% and 91.28%, respectively, indicating that the prediction performance of the model was good; The calibration curve constructed by internal cross-validation suggested that the predicted results of the nomogram agreed well with the actual observed values.The nomogram model has a high accuracy for predicting esophageal stricture after esophageal ESD and is extremely important to reduce or avoid the occurrence of esophageal stricture.

To reduce mortality rate, accurate detection and diagnose of suspicious pancreatic tumors at an early stage plays an important role.  Objective:   To develop and test a new radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme of computed tomography (CT) images to detect and classify suspicious pancreatic tumors.  Methods:   A retrospective dataset consisting of 77 patients who had suspicious pancreatic tumors detected on CT images was assembled in which 33 tumors are malignant. A CAD scheme was developed using the following 5 steps namely, (1) apply an image pre-processing algorithm to filter and reduce image noise, (2) use a deep learning model to detect and segment pancreas region, (3) apply a modified region growing algorithm to segment tumor region, (4) compute and select optimal radiomics features, and (5) train and test a support vector machine (SVM) model to classify the detected pancreatic tumor using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method.  Results:   By using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an evaluation index, SVM model yields AUC = 0.750 with 95% confidence interval [0.624, 0.885] to classify pancreatic tumors.  Conclusions:   Study results indicate that radiomics features computed from CT images contain useful information associated with risk of tumor malignancy.

Certain morphological and preoperative parameters, such as birth weight below 2.5 kg, restrictive atrial septal defect, extracardiac anomalies and the diameter of the ascending aorta, were found to be associated with the LOS in the ICU. Analysis using early postoperative haemodynamic variables revealed that systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, serum lactate levels and reduced ventricular function at 2 days postoperatively were associated with the LOS in the ICU. Birth weight <2.5 kg (P = 0.010), a restrictive atrial septal defect (P = 0.001) and smaller ascending aorta (P = 0.039) were associated with death in the ICU.

Methods:   In this randomized controlled trial, the en bloc resection and reconstruction were performed in 36 patients with distal femoral primary bone tumor. Patients were divided into 2 groups randomly according to the application of antibiotic bone cement coating, which included antibiotic cement coating group (16 cases) and control group (18 cases). There were 10 men and 6 women in anti-infection group, aged from 18 to 54 years (23.47 ± 3.53), and there were 12 men and 6 women in control group, aged from 19 to 56 years (24.16 ± 4.32). The tumor type, age, sex, and Enneking stage were enrolled with well-matched of the 2 groups of patients. There was no difference between bundles and routine standard care for each group. The antibiotic cement was coated on the surface of polyethylene jacket with punched holes during operation. The peri-prosthetic infection, local recurrence and distant metastasis were followed up and limb functions were evaluated by Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 (MSTS93) scoring system.  Results:   Patients were followed up till 34.7 months (range 18∼62 months). There was no periprosthetic infection in anti-infection group. Four cases in control group showed deep infection.

We evaluated [177Lu]Lu-BL02 in MCL models, and evaluated its potential for therapy in Z138 MCL xenografts.  Results:   Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CXCR4 expression were correlated with poor survival in patients with MCL and characterized by unique underlying molecular signatures. [68Ga]Ga-BL02 uptake correlated with CXCR4 expression, and localized lesions in a metastatic xenograft model. [177Lu]Lu-BL02 showed high uptake in MCL xenografts. Therapy studies with a single dose in the Z138 model showed tumor regression and improved survival compared with a control group. Upon regrowth, the treated mice experienced concurrent metastasis alongside localized xenograft regrowth, and recurrent lesions showed enhanced CXCR4 signaling.  Conclusions:   CXCR4 is an independent factor of poor prognosis for MCL and a promising target for imaging and radioligand therapy.

We classified patients with an MP of <40% at final follow-up in the Good group and those with an MP of ≥40% in the Poor group. The Good group included 10 children (14 hips), and the Poor group included 8 children (8 hips). No preoperative differences were found in the means of all the radiographical parameters. However, MP was significantly different between the groups from 1 year postoperatively. ARA showed improvement 5 years after surgery in the Good group. Change MP in the Good group was maintained from immediately after surgery to the final follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that preoperative break in SL and Change MP immediately after surgery were parameters to predict MP at the final follow-up. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the cut-off values were estimated to be 19.2 mm for preoperative SL and 79.0% for Change MP immediately after surgery.

Results:   A total of 2257 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; among them, 127 were consulted by a neurologist during their hospital stay. Fifteen patients received a consultation for possible drug interactions. Among the remaining 112 patients, the reason for neurology consultation was i. exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity vs ii. new-onset neurological manifestations. The median age was 68.5 ± 14.2 years, and 60.7% were men. Dementia and stroke were the leading neurological comorbidities. COVID-19 disease was more severe in the patients with the new-onset neurological comorbidity than in patients with exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity (p = 0.07). Serum creatinine kinase levels were higher in the new-onset patient group (p < 0.05). Exacerbation of previous neurological disease or new neurological impairment were jointly and severely related to high mortality (overall 35/112 vs 275/2145, p < 0.001; exacerbation 12/45 vs 275/2145 p < 0.01; new-onset 23/67 vs 275/2145, p < 0.001).

Methods:   All consecutive IVF/ICSI cycles (fresh and frozen) involving single embryo transfer (SET) resulting in a live birth between 2015 and 2019 were retrospective analyzed. Logistic regression was used to model the effect on the SSR of maternal and specific ART characteristics.  Results:   Six thousand nine hundred twenty-two women were included with the crude SSR of 54.8%. The impact of BT on SSR is influenced by the fertilization method used. After adjustment for potential confounders, the SSR in the ICSI BT group was significantly higher when compared to ICSI cleavage-stage embryo SET (aOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10-1.40, P < 0.001). However, this effect was not detected among SBT with IVF treatment (aOR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97-1.12, P = 0.260).

A strategy that was based on the validated QTc risk scoring tool and replacing medication knowledge vendor alerts with custom QTc prolongation alerts was implemented.  Methods:   This is a retrospective quasi-experimental study with a pre-intervention period (August 2019 to October 2019) and post-intervention period (December 2019 to February 2020). The custom alert was implemented in November 2019.  Results:   In the pre-implementation group, 361 (19.3%) patients developed QTc prolongation, and in the post-implementation group, 357 (19.6%) patients developed QTc prolongation (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.87-1.20, p = 0.81). The odds ratio of an action taken post-implementation compared with pre-implementation was 18.90 (95% CI: 14.03-25.47, p <0. 001).

Whether these differences persist within clinical trials is unknown. We examined survival, by age, in patients receiving response-adapted therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma on Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials.  Methods:   Patients (aged 1-21 years) diagnosed with classical Hodgkin lymphoma and enrolled between Sept 23, 2002, and Jan 19, 2012, on one of three phase 3 COG trials in the USA and Canada were eligible for inclusion. The three COG trials were defined by risk group according to Ann Arbor stage, B-symptoms, and bulk (AHOD0431 [low risk; NCT00302003], AHOD0031 [intermediate risk; NCT00025259], or AHOD0831 [high risk; NCT01026220]). The outcomes of this study were event-free survival (death, relapse, or subsequent neoplasm) and overall survival. Cox proportional hazards models estimated survival, adjusting for disease and treatment factors both overall and in patients with mixed cellularity or non-mixed cellularity (nodular sclerosing and not-otherwise-specified) disease.  Findings:   Of 2155 patients enrolled on the three trials, 1907 (88·4%; 968 [50·8%] male and 939 [49·2%] female; 1227 [64·3%] non-Hispanic White) were included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 7·4 years (IQR 4·3-10·2), older patients (aged ≥15 years) had worse unadjusted 5-year event-free survival (80% [95% CI 78-83]) than did younger patients (aged <15 years; 86% [83-88]; HR 1·38 [1·11-1·71]; p=0·0038). Older patients also had worse unadjusted 5-year overall survival than did younger patients (96% [95% CI 95-97] vs 99% [98-99]; HR 2·50 [1·41-4·45]; p=0·0012). In patients with non-mixed cellularity histology, older patients had a significantly increased risk of having an event than did younger patients with the same histology (HR 1·32 [1·03-1·68]; p=0·027). Older patients with mixed cellularity had significantly worse 5-year event-free survival than did younger patients in unadjusted (77% [95% CI 65-86] for older patients vs 94% [88-97] for younger patients; HR 2·93 [1·37-6·29]; p=0·0039) and multivariable models (HR 3·72 [1·56-8·91]; p=0·0032). Overall, older patients were more likely to die than younger patients (HR 3·08 [1·49-6·39]; p=0·0025).  Interpretation:   Adolescents (≥15 years) treated on COG Hodgkin lymphoma trials had worse event-free survival and increased risk of death compared with children (<15 years).

Methods:   Eighty-three patients met the criterion of having previously irradiated OSCC treated via curative intent re-RT for recurrent or new primary OSCC. The exclusion criteria were a suboptimal dose (<45 Gy) for the first RT and palliative intent for the second irradiation. Re-RT was defined as at least 75% volume at second RT after receiving at least 45 Gy at the first RT.  Results:   The 2-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 20% and 28%. For LRPFS, four predictors were noted through univariate analyses: performance status (PS) (p = 0.001), a dose of at least 60 Gy (p = 0.001), stage IVB (p = 0.020), and surgery before re-RT (p = 0.041). In multivariate analyses, only PS (p = 0.005) and a dose of at least 60 Gy (p = 0.001) remained significant. For OS, PS (p = 0.001) and a dose of at least 60 Gy (p = 0.042) were still independently associated predictors, but surgery before re-RT became marginally beneficial (p = 0.053). For patients with a poor PS (ECOG = 2-3), the 2-year OS was only 4.5%. Twenty-nine percent of the patients experienced severe late complications (≥Grade 3), and 18% had new episodes of osteoradionecrosis during their follow-up.  Conclusion:   We identified PS and a re-RT dose ≥60 Gy as predictors for LRPFS and OS. Surgery before re-RT might improve OS. However, the treatment results of re-RT for OSCC were suboptimal.

All patients with axial lower back who received the preliminary diagnosis of lumbar facet joint-mediated pain and refractory to conservative therapy underwent diagnostic medial branch blocks. CRFA was recommended to those patients who responded favorably to two sets of diagnostic medial branch blocks. Pain scores in numeric rating scale (NRS) were recorded pre-treatment and post-treatment at different time-points. The primary outcome measure was to report descriptive NRS score and average % improvement from baseline at each time point. A significant pain relief was determined by a decrease of ≥50% of mean NRS. Secondary outcome measure was the time to repeat treatment with subsequent CRFA. Adverse events were also recorded.Primary outcome measure determined as the improvement in NRS, for at least 50% or more, was achieved in both 1st (4-8 weeks) and 2nd (>2-6 months) follow-up (FU) with 60.5% and 53.6% reduction in NRS respectively.

We retrospectively analyzed neurosurgical procedures between January 2015, and December 2019, in a single regional hospital. The definition of an unplanned return to the operating room was a patient who underwent two operations within 30 days when the second procedure was not planned, staged, or related to the natural course of the disease.A total of 4365 patients were identified in our analysis, of which 93 (2%) had an unplanned return to the operating room within 30 days of their initial surgery during admission. The most common reason for an unplanned return to the operating room for a cranial procedure was hemorrhage, followed by hydrocephalus and subdural effusion, which accounted for 49.5%(46/93), 12%(11/93), and 5.4%(5/93) of cases, respectively. In spinal procedures, the most common cause of return was a residual disc, followed by surgical site infection, which accounted for 5.4%(5/93) and 4.3%(4/93) of cases, respectively. The overall median time interval for unplanned returns to the operating room was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-9).Lowering the rate of postoperative hemorrhage in cranial surgery and postoperative residual disc in spine surgery was crucial as an internal audit in a 5-year single institute follow-up.

However, patients occasionally experience delayed postoperative recovery. Although several prognostic factors associated with long-term outcomes have been identified, the factors associated with delayed recovery after trapeziectomy with LRTI have not been identified.  Hypothesis:   When we define major disability in the early postoperative period at 3 months after LRTI surgery as delayed recovery, some preoperative factors can influence with delayed recovery. Moreover, delayed recovery can influence the long-term therapeutic outcome.  Patients and methods:   Thirty thumbs that underwent trapeziectomy with LRTI (mean follow-up period, 29.3 months) were retrospectively analyzed. Major disability was defined by both DASH and Hand20 scores≥35 after surgery, and patients were divided into groups 1 (major disability; n=9) and 2 (no major disability; n=21) according to the scores at 3 months after surgery. Preoperative data, including age, sex, preoperative symptom duration, dominant hand surgery, concurrent surgery with LRTI, previous orthopedic surgery, employment, stage of osteoarthritis, thickness of the trapezium, metacarpophalangeal hyperextension deformity, DASH score, Hand20 score, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain, grip strength, pinch strength, and range of motion of the thumb were compared between groups to identify the factors indicating a poor prognosis at 3 months after surgery. We also compared the clinical outcomes at the 12-month and final follow-up.  Results:   Dominant hand surgery, previous orthopedic surgery, and preoperative poor DASH score were significantly more frequent in group 1, while the other factors did not show significant intergroup differences. Moreover, group 1 showed significantly poorer DASH score, grip and pinch strength, and active flexion of the thumb metacarpal joint at both the 12-month and final follow-up. This group also showed significantly poorer Hand20 and VAS scores at the final follow-up.  Discussion:   Dominant hand surgery, previous orthopedic surgery, and preoperative poor DASH score were associated with poor recovery at 3 months after trapeziectomy with LRTI. Moreover, major disability at 3 months after surgery influenced poor clinical outcomes at the 12-month and final follow-ups. These data could be useful for counseling patients regarding the expected recovery duration and outcomes after LRTI surgery.

Associations between the correction angle from the standing-flexion position to prone position and postoperative standing-flexion correction angle were determined by linear regression analysis.Pre- and postoperative ATR for the standing-flexion position showed a moderate association (r = 0.64, P < .01). A similar correlation was seen for pre-operative prone-position ATR and postoperative standing-flexion ATR (r = 0.56, P < .01). In linear regression analysis, there was significant proportional error between the correction angle from the standing-flexion position to prone position and postoperative standing-flexion correction angle (β = 0.40, P < .01).In conclusion, pre-operative ATR in either standing-flexion or prone position and postoperative standing-flexion ATR displayed moderate associations.

Patient concerns:   An 80-year-old man complained of distorted vision and decreased visual acuity (VA) in his left eye for 12 months.  Diagnosis:   We conducted quantitative functional evaluation on the area of RS and SRD using the Humphrey visual field analyzer. Fundus examination and optical coherence tomography showed SRD and RS in connection with the optic disc. The best-corrected logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) VA was 0.7.  Interventions:   The patient underwent JPL treatment combined with pars plana vitrectomy. During surgery, posterior vitreous detachment and tamponade were created with sulfur hexafluoride.  Outcomes:   After surgery, SRD (and subsequently RS) gradually reduced and had completely disappeared at 31 months. VA gradually improved and was 0.0 (logMAR) at 28 months. The analysis of the mean macular thickness of the central 3-mm diameter showed that the macula thickness recovered to 300 μm at 17 months postoperatively. Retinal sensitivity began to improve at 24 months postoperatively and had increased at 48 months postoperatively.  Lessons:   In conclusion, vitrectomy with JPL treatment for ODP-M had a favorable anatomical outcome as well as a long-term functional outcome.

LPCV transposition was considered feasible in patients in whom the diuretic loading test revealed a decrease in the pelvic volume after correction of vascular compression as well as absence of structural changes in the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and hemodynamic compromise of the lower renal pole. The fascial flap was passed below the LPCV to form a ""hammock"". The free edge of the flap was sutured to its base.Group 1 consisted of 102 (69.9%) patients (median age: 7.9 years) undergoing dismembered Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty, while group 2 included 44 (30.1%) patients (median age: 8.4 years) treated with upward transposition and the new technique to fix the LPCV. No intra-operative complications or conversions occurred in either group. Redo-pyeloplasty was performed in 3 (2.9%) children of group 1 and 1 (2.3%) child of group 2. Renal ultrasonography conducted 12 months after surgery revealed similar anteroposterior diameters of the renal pelvis in groups 1 (7.9 ± 8.1 mm) and 2 (6.0 ± 2.9 mm).

All blood samples were collected on admission. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to detect the serum level of STC1. Spearman analysis was used to explore the relationship between STC1 and clinical severity. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the prognostic role of STC1 in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to investigate the power of STC1 in predicting outcome in aSAH patients.Serum STC1 concentration was significantly higher in aSAH patients than in healthy individuals. Serum concentration of STC1 positively correlated with Hunt-Hess grade (r = 0.62, P < .01) and Fisher grade (r = 0.48, P < .01), and negatively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale on admission (r = -0.45, P < .01).

Moreover, patients with poor outcome had higher concentration of STC1 than patients with good outcome (11.82 ± 0.62 vs 8.21 ± 0.35,P < 0.01). Results of univariate and multivariate logistic analysis revealed that Hunt-hess III-IV, DCI, and high STC1 level were independent risk factors associated with poor outcome of patients with aSAH.

The 24-h urine protein (24hUP), serum albumin (ALB), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase levels on the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months of treatment and phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) level before and after treatment were compared in both groups.We recruited 64 patients who were assigned to either the GC group (n = 31) or TWP group (n = 33). No difference in baseline indicators between the two groups were observed (P > .05). After 12 months, the 24hUP levels of both groups significantly decreased compared with that at baseline (P < .01). At the end of the sixth month, 24hUP of the TWP group were less and reduced more quickly than those in the GC group (P < .05), but there is no difference at the other time point (P > .05). After treatment, the number of patients who up to the standard of TG and the ALB levels in both groups increased (P < .05), the LDL-C levels and the number of patients positive for PLA2R in both groups were reduced (P < .05), and no significant difference was observed in the overall changes of 24hUP, ALB and LDL-C levels, TG compliance rate, and PLA2R positive rate between both groups (P > .05). During treatment, no patient in either group had hepatorenal dysfunction, one case in the TWP group and two cases in the GC group experienced side effects, but no apparent difference in the side effects were observed between both groups (P > .05).Two therapeutic schemes have the advantage of reducing urinary protein excretion in patients with IMN.

Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and one-year mortality. Secondary outcomes included IE complications and relapses.From 3467 patients included in the GAMES database, 295 (8.5%) received LNZ. After excluding 3 patients, 292 were grouped as follows for the analyses: 99 (33.9%) patients in LNZ < 7 days, 11 (3.7%) in LNZ high-impact, and 178 (61%) in LNZ-NHI. In-hospital mortality was 51.5%, 54.4%, and 19.1% respectively. In the propensity analysis, LNZ high-impact group presented with respect to matched controls not treated with LNZ higher in-hospital mortality (54.5% vs 18.2%, P = .04). The multivariate analysis showed an independent relationship of LNZ use with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 9.06, 95% confidence interval 1.15--71.08, P = .03).Treatment with LNZ is relatively frequent, but most cases do not fulfill our high-impact criteria.

A wide variety of masks are used during CPAP therapy. The aim of the study is to compare polysomnography outcomes during titration for different types of masks (oronasal, nasal and pillow) and assess the impact on PAP titration.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed all CPAP titration polysomnography for one year. Anthropometric data and baseline apnea severity were documented.  Results:   A total of 497 patients were evaluated. Nasal masks were used in 82.3% (n = 409), pillow in 14.1% (n = 70) and oronasal in 3.6% (n = 18). There was no difference according to body mass index and baseline apnea-hypopnea index among the groups. The oronasal group was older and had higher titrated CPAP pressure, higher residual apnea-hypopnea index, lower sleep efficiency, more superficial N1 sleep and longer wake time after sleep onset. All other polysomnography outcomes were similar among the groups. The mean CPAP level was 11.6 ± 2.1 cm H2O for the oronasal mask, 10.1 ± 2.1 cm H2O for the nasal mask and 9.8 ± 2.2 cm H2O for the pillow. The residual apnea-hypopnea index was 10.4 ± 7.9 for the oronasal mask, 5.49 ± 5.34 events/h for the nasal mask and 4.98 ± 5.48 events/h for the pillow. The baseline apnea-hypopnea index was correlated with of a higher CPAP pressure for all the groups (p < 0.001 for the nasal group, p = 0.001 for the pillow group and p = 0.049 for the oronasal group). Body mass index and residual AHI were correlated with of a higher CPAP pressure for the nasal and pillow groups only (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The interface can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of PAP titration. Patients with oronasal masks have higher CPAP pressure, higher residual apnea-hypopnea index, lower sleep efficiency and higher wake time after sleep onset.

The presence of residual perfusion abnormalities post-EVT may be associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown in response to mechanical disruption of the endothelium from multiple-pass thrombectomy. We hypothesize that multiple-pass versus single-pass thrombectomy is associated with a higher rate of residual hypoperfusion and increased lesion growth at 24 h.  Materials and methods:   For this analysis, we included patients presenting to one of two stroke centers between January 2015 and February 2018 with an acute ischemic stroke within 12 h from symptom onset if they had a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation documented on magnetic resonance angiography or CTA, baseline MRI pre-EVT with imaging evidence of hypoperfusion, underwent EVT, and had a post-EVT MRI with qualitatively interpretable perfusion-weighted imaging data at 24 h. MRI Tmax maps using a time delay threshold of >6 s were used to quantitate hypoperfusion volumes. Residual hypoperfusion at 24 h was solely defined as Tmax volume >10 mL with >6 s delay. Complete recanalization was defined as modified treatment in cerebral infarction visualized on angiography at EVT completion. Hyperintense acute reperfusion injury marker was assessed on post-EVT pre-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery at 24 h. Major early neurological improvement was defined as a reduction of the admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by ≥8 points or a score of 0-1 at 24 h. Good functional outcome was defined as 0-2 on the modified Rankin Scale on day 30 or 90.  Results:   Fifty-five patients were included with median age 67 years, 58% female, 45% Black/African American, 36% White/Caucasian, median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 19, large vessel occlusion locations: 71% M1, 14.5% iICA, 14.5% M2, 69% treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Of these, 58% had multiple-pass thrombectomy, 39% had residual perfusion abnormalities at 24 h, and 64% had severe hyperintense acute reperfusion injury marker at 24 h. After adjusting for complete recanalization, only multiple-pass thrombectomy (odds ratio, 4.3 95% CI, 1.07-17.2; p = 0.04) was an independent predictor of residual hypoperfusion at 24 h. Patients with residual hypoperfusion had larger lesion growth on diffusion-weighted imaging (59 mL vs. 8 mL, p < 0.001), lower rate of major early neurological improvement (24% vs. 70%, p = 0.002) at 24 h, and worse long-term outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale at 30 or 90 days, 5 versus 2 (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that incomplete reperfusion on post-EVT MRI is present even in some patients with successful recanalization at the time of EVT and is associated with multiple-pass thrombectomy, lesion growth, and worse outcome.

To generate hypotheses about RPE participation in fibrosis, we correlate histology to clinical imaging in an eye with prominent black pigment in fibrotic scar secondary to nvAMD.  Methods:   Macular findings in a white woman with untreated inactive subretinal fibrosis due to nvAMD in her right eye were documented over 9 years with color fundus photography (CFP), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After death (age 90 years), this index eye was prepared for light and electron microscopy to analyze 7 discrete zones of pigmentation in the fibrotic scar. In additional donor eyes with nvAMD, we determined the frequency of black pigment (n = 36 eyes) and immuno-labeled for retinoid, immunologic, and microglial markers (RPE65, CD68, Iba1, TMEM119; n = 3 eyes).  Results:   During follow-up of the index eye, black pigment appeared and expanded within a hypoautofluorescent fibrotic scar. The blackest areas correlated to melanotic cells (containing large spherical melanosomes), some in multiple layers. Pale areas had sparse pigmented cells. Gray areas correlated to cells with RPE organelles entombed in the scar and multinucleate cells containing sparse large spherical melanosomes. In 94% of nvAMD donor eyes, hyperpigmentation was visible. Certain melanotic cells expressed some RPE65 and mostly CD68. Iba1 and TMEM119 immunoreactivity, found both in retina and scar, did not co-localize with melanotic cells.  Conclusion:   Hyperpigmentation in CFP results from both organelle content and optical superimposition effects. Black fundus pigment in nvAMD is common and corresponds to cells containing numerous large spherical melanosomes and superimposition of cells containing sparse large melanosomes, respectively. Melanotic cells are molecularly distinct from RPE, consistent with a process of transdifferentiation. The subcellular source of spherical melanosomes remains to be determined. Detailed histology of nvAMD eyes will inform future studies using technologies for spatially resolved molecular discovery to generate new therapies for fibrosis. The potential of black pigment as a biomarker for fibrosis can be investigated in clinical multimodal imaging datasets.""","""['Ling Chen', 'Dongfeng Cao', 'Jeffrey D Messinger', 'Thomas Ach', 'Daniela Ferrara', 'K Bailey Freund', 'Christine A Curcio']""","""[' The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Chongqing Eye Institute, Chongqing Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Chongqing, PR China; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA.', ' Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA.', ' Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', ' Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', ' Vitreous Retina Macula Consultants of New York, New York, NY, USA; Department of Ophthalmology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', ' Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA.

This reduction was predicted in an in vitro study in our laboratory, which has previously shown a 20.4% reduction in KAP.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted of the radiation exposure to compare the measured KAP recorded during the period when conventional magnification with automatic brightness and dose control was used on a Siemens Artis Zee X-ray machine with a flat panel detector and when magnification settings were avoided by using a large screen to enlarge and project a non-magnified image by digital magnification. The analysis was carried out for patients having a diagnostic coronary angiogram and those having an interventional coronary procedure.  Results:   For diagnostic coronary angiograms the median KAP per procedure in the period using conventional magnification was 2124.5 µGy.m2 compared to 1401 µGy.m2 when image matrix magnification was used, a 34% reduction (p < 0.0001). For interventional coronary procedures, the median KAP per procedure in the period using conventional magnification was 3791 µGy.m2 compared to 2568.5 µGy.m2 when image matrix magnification was used, a 32% reduction (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Avoiding using conventional magnification in the cardiac catheter laboratory and using a large screen to magnify images was associated with a statistically significant greater than 30% reduction in KAP.  Advances in knowledge:   This paper is the proof in clinical practice of a theoretical conclusion that radiation dose (KAP) is reduced by use of Image matrix magnification using a large viewing screen without the need to use X-ray tube magnification without significant loss of image resolution in interventional cardiology.

We hypothesize that clinical factors besides albumin and protein in the blood that cause laboratory errors might be associated with sodium ion level difference between the 2 methods in very-low-birth-weight infants during early life after birth. Among very-low-birth-weight infants who were admitted to Jeonbuk National Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Units from October 2013 to December 2016, 106 neonates were included in this study. Arterial blood sample was collected within an hour after birth. Blood gas analyzer and biochemistry autoanalyzer were performed simultaneously. Seventy-six (71.7%) were found to have sodium ion difference exceeding 4 mmol/L between 2 methods. The mean difference of sodium ion level was 5.9 ± 6.1 mmol/L, exceeding 4 mmol/L. Based on sodium ion level difference, patients were divided into >4 and ≤4 mmol/L groups. The sodium level difference >4 mmol/L group showed significantly (P < .05) higher sodium level by biochemistry autoanalyzer, lower albumin, lower protein, and higher maximum percent of physiological weight than the sodium level difference ≤4 mmol/L group. After adjusting for factors showing significant difference between the 2 groups, protein at birth (odds ratio: 0.835, 95% confidence interval: 0.760-0.918, P < .001) and percent of maximum weight loss (odds ratio: 1.137, 95% confidence interval: 1.021-1.265, P = .019) were factor showing significant associations with sodium level difference >4 mmol/L between 2 methods. Thus, difference in sodium level between blood gas analyzer and biochemistry autoanalyzer in early stages of life could reflect maximum physiology weight loss.

The aim of this study was to describe the radiologic pattern of these tumors and correlate this pattern with histopathologic findings.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective, noninterventional study included 10 children diagnosed with a CNS tumor, either by ribonucleic acid-sequencing analysis or deoxyribonucleic acid methylation analysis. Clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic data were collected. A neuropathologist reviewed 9 tumor samples. Preoperative images were analyzed in consensus by 7 pediatric radiologists.  Results:   All tumors were relatively large (range, 4.7-9.2 cm) intra-axial peripheral masses with well-defined borders and no peritumoral edema. All tumors showed mild and heterogeneous enhancement and marked restriction on DWI of the solid portions. Perfusion imaging showed a relatively lower CBF in the tumor than in the adjacent normal parenchyma. Nine of 10 tumors showed areas of necrosis, with the presence of hemorrhage in 8/10 and calcifications in 4/7. Large intratumoral macroscopic veins were observed in 9/10 patients. No intracranial or spinal leptomeningeal dissemination was noted at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   CNS tumors with a BCL6 corepressor gene internal tandem duplication present as large intra-axial peripheral masses with well-defined borders, no edema, restricted diffusion, weak contrast enhancement, frequent central necrosis, hemorrhage and calcifications, intratumoral veins, and no leptomeningeal dissemination at the time of diagnosis.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of host and tumor factors in development of DM.  Materials and methods:   After IRB approval, 1369 patients with OSCC undergoing primary surgery were eligible for the study. The primary endpoint was the development of distant metastasis (DM). Patients were pathologically staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th Edition. Pre-operative peripheral blood counts were used to calculate neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).  Results:   Median follow-up was 39 months (range 1-221). DM were identified in 126 patients during follow-up. When analyzed as a time-dependent covariate, neck recurrence (NR) was a significant predictor of DM (HR 16.35, 95% CI: 11.39-23.47, p < 0.001). NLR, margin status, vascular invasion, perineural invasion (PNI), grade, pT, number of metastatic lymph nodes, level IV involvement, and extra nodal-extension (ENE) were also significant. In multivariable analysis, NLR, margins, PNI, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and ENE maintained independent predictive capacity. Patients with NLR ≥ 5.7 were 3 times more likely to develop DM compared to NLR ≤ 2.9 (95% CI: 1.74-5.59, p < 0.001), patients with ≥ 5 metastatic lymph nodes were 2 times more likely to develop DM (95% CI: 1.18-3.60, p = 0.011), and those with ENE were 4 times more likely (95% CI: 2.67-8.20, p < 0.001) when compared to pNx/pN0 patients.

The management of IMT has not been standardized.  Methods:   A retrospective multicenter study was conducted on all pediatric patients treated for IMT between 2000 and 2019.  Results:   This series included 39 cases of IMT, with a median age at diagnosis of 7 years (range 20 days to 16 years). Tumor location included pelvis-abdomen (n = 16), thorax (n = 14), head and neck (n = 7), and limbs (n = 2). One patient had metastatic disease. Immunochemistry showed 21/39 (54%) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive tumors. Somatic tyrosine kinase rearrangement was present in 31/36 (86%) of the tumors analyzed: 21 ALK, five ROS1, and five NTRK. Immediate surgery was performed in 24 patients (62%), with adjuvant therapy for three patients. Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant therapy was possible in 10 cases. Exclusive systemic therapy was delivered to four patients; one patient with orbital IMT was managed by watchful waiting. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range 5-124), eight (20%) recurrences/progressions occurred after surgery (seven after primary surgery and one after delayed surgery), after a median interval of 7 months (range 2-21), all in thoracic locations.

Management is guided by research reported over 50 years ago when chronic aspirin toxicity was common and accounted for significant morbidity. We investigate our experience of aspirin overdose and the effectiveness of charcoal and bicarbonate administration over 20 years.  Methods:   This is a retrospective series of acute aspirin overdose from two toxicology units from January 2000 to September 2019. Acute aspirin ingestions > 3000 mg were identified in each unit's database. Excluded were cases of chronic exposure, hospital presentation > 24 hours after ingestion, and cases without a salicylate concentration. Included in our analysis was demographic data, clinical effects, investigations, complications, and treatment.  Results:   There were 132 presentations in 108 patients (79 females (73%)). The median age was 28 years (range: 13-93 years). The median dose ingested was 7750 mg (IQR: 6000-14,400 mg). There were 44 aspirin-only ingestions. Mild toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hyperventilation) occurred in 22 with a median dose of 160 mg/kg. Moderate toxicity (acid-base disturbance, confusion) occurred in 16 with a median ingested dose of 297 mg/kg. There were no cases of severe toxicity (coma or seizures) due to aspirin alone. The median peak salicylate concentration was 276 mg/L (IQR: 175-400 mg/L, range: 14-814 mg/L). There was a moderate association between dose ingested and peak concentration (Pearson r = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45-0.68). Activated charcoal was administered in 36 (27%) cases, which decreased the median peak salicylate concentration (34.2 to 24.8 mg/L/g (difference: 9.4, 95% CI: 1.0-13.1)). Bicarbonate was administered in 34 (26%) presentations, decreasing the median apparent elimination half-life from 13.4 to 9.3 h (difference: 4.2 h, 95% CI: 1.0-6.5 h).  Conclusions:   Acute aspirin overdose caused only mild to moderate effects in this series.

However, medium-vessel occlusions are often challenging to detect, especially for unexperienced readers. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and interrater agreement of the detection of medium-vessel occlusions using single-phase and multiphase CTA.  Materials and methods:   Single-phase and multiphase CTA of 120 patients with acute ischemic stroke (20 with no occlusion, 44 with large-vessel occlusion, and 56 with medium-vessel occlusion in the anterior and posterior circulation) were assessed by 3 readers with varying levels of experience (session 1: single-phase CTA; session 2: multiphase CTA). Interrater agreement for occlusion type (large-vessel occlusion versus medium-vessel occlusion versus no occlusion) and for detailed occlusion sites was calculated using the Fleiss κ with 95% confidence intervals. Accuracy for the detection of medium-vessel occlusions was calculated for each reader using classification tables.  Results:   Interrater agreement for occlusion type was moderate for single-phase CTA (κ = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.56-0.62) and almost perfect for multiphase CTA (κ = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.78-0.83).

We tried to develop a physiologic MR imaging-based spatial habitat analysis to identify regions associated with treatment resistance to facilitate the prediction of tumor response after initial chemotherapy in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.  Materials and methods:   Eighty-one patients with pathologically confirmed primary central nervous system lymphoma were enrolled. Pretreatment physiologic MR imaging was performed, and K-means clustering was used to separate voxels into 3 spatial habitats according to ADC and CBV values. Associations of spatial habitats and clinical and conventional imaging predictors with time to progression were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. The performance of statistically significant predictors for time to progression was assessed using the concordance probability index.  Results:   The 3 spatial habitats of hypervascular cellular tumor, hypovascular cellular tumor, and hypovascular hypocellular tumor were identified. A large hypovascular cellular habitat was most significantly associated with short time to progression (hazard ratio, 2.83; P = . 017).

Retrospective analyses using stored dried blood specimens have been limited, mainly due to a lack of biochemical information on the long-term stability of acylcarnitines and amino acids in stored specimens. We studied the characteristic profiles of the stability of amino acid, free carnitine, and acyl carnitines in dried blood specimens stored in a refrigerator after newborn screening.  Methods:   Dried blood specimens from 198 healthy newborns, which had been stored in a refrigerator at 5 °C after newborn screening, were prospectively subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analyses after 1, 3, 6 months, 1 and 2 years of storage. We also retrospectively re-analyzed the stored samples from 90 newborns, which had been analyzed and stored at 5 °C for 4 years.  Results:   We found that proline (Pro) and tyrosine (Tyr) were stable for 2 years, and that alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), and phenylalanine (Phe) decayed with linear regression. The C0 increased during the time-course of 2 years, whereas most acylcarnitines gradually decayed and some showed a linear correlation. The retrospective analysis of samples stored for 4 years revealed that Ala, Phe, Pro and Tyr were almost stable, leucine (Leu), valine (Val) decayed with linear regression, C0 increased, and C10, C12, C14, C14:1, C16, C18, C18:1 decreased, while maintaining a linear correlation.

Methods:   This was a retrospective analysis of the data of 73 patients with NPC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before treatment from January 2010 to December 2014. The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of NPC and the PLR within 1 week before treatment were both measured. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the differences between the SUVmax and PLR among the different clinical characteristics of patients with NPC and the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate; according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the best cutoff values of the SUVmax and PLR were obtained and used to group patients. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test were used to conduct univariate analysis of 5-year PFS in patients with NPC, and Cox regression was used to conduct multivariate analysis; differences in the 5-year PFS of patients with different SUVmax values combined with the PLR were compared.  Results:   The SUVmax and PLR of patients with disease progression within 5 years were higher than those of patients without disease progression (p = 0.006 and p = 0.026). SUVmax = 9.7 and PLR = 132.98 had the best prognostic diagnostic efficiency for patients. Cox multivariate analysis showed that the SUVmax and PLR are independent factors affecting the prognosis of NPC. The 5-year PFS of patients with SUVmax <9.7 was significantly higher than that of patients with SUVmax ≥9.7 in the high PLR group (PLR ≥132.98) and in the low PLR group (PLR <132.98) (59.3% vs 29.4%, p = 0.033 and 90.9% vs 42.9%, p = 0.006, respectively). For patients with SUVmax <9.7, the 5-year PFS of the high PLR group was significantly lower than the low PLR group (59.3% vs 90.9%, p = 0.016); for patients with SUVmax ≥9.7, there was no significant difference in 5-year PFS between the high PLR group and the low PLR group (29.4% vs 42.9%, p = 0.406).  Conclusions:   Both the SUVmax of the primary tumor and the PLR before treatment have an important influence on the prognosis of NPC. Combining the SUVmax and the PLR can more accurately predict the prognosis of patients with NPC.  Advances in knowledge:   In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of combining pretreatment tumor 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT imaging and PLR in NPC patients.

Although the risk of malignancy, among other complications, is well recognized and occurs most frequently after ureterosigmoidostomies and cystoplasties, data on the histopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of these tumors are scant. This study aims to evaluate the clinicopathological features of secondary tumors arising after urologic reconstruction procedures. Eleven cases were identified among five collaborating academic institutions. The average age was 51.7 years, and the M:F ratio was 8:3. Surgical procedures included 7 ileal conduits, 2 gastrocystoplasties, 1 augmentation cystoplasty not otherwise specified (NOS), and 1 Indiana pouch. Median time from reconstruction to malignancy was 36 years. Malignancy included adenocarcinoma in 10 patients (intestinal type in 6, gastric in 2, signet-ring cell in 1, undetermined type after neoadjuvant treatment in 1) and squamous cell carcinoma in 1. By immunohistochemistry, the adenocarcinomas were CK7 (45%), CK20 (89%), CK903 (78%), CDX2 (89%), SATB2 (67%), and beta-catenin (100%) positive. GATA-3 was negative in all cases. Pathologic stage was T1 (30%), T2 (40%), T3 (20%), and T4 (10%). Regional lymph node and distant metastasis were present in 60% and 20%, respectively. Treatment included multimodality therapy in most patients. On follow-up (mean, 27.4 months), 2 patients were dead (1 of disease), 3 were alive with disease, 4 were alive without disease, and 2 were lost to follow-up.

Methods:   This was a retrospective study conducted with computed tomography imaging of the paranasal sinuses of 390 pediatric patients referred over a six-year period in Sakarya and Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine. Patients were divided into 3 groups as 1-6, 6-12, and 12-18 years old. The depth of the olfactory fossa was measured and classified according to the Keros classification. The incidence of Keros asymmetries was also investigated.  Results:   The distribution of the depth of a total of 780 olfactory fossa according to the Keros classification was 24.7% Keros I, 65.9% Keros II, and 9.4% Keros III. When the groups were evaluated with each other and within each group, it was seen that the prevalence of Keros I type was significantly higher in the first group (p<0.05), and the prevalence of Keros type II was significantly higher in the second and third groups (p<0.05). Apart from this, the number of Keros type III increased in the third group compared to the first two groups and showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Among all patients, asymmetry of the olfactory fossa was detected in 29 patients (7.4%). Although the number of olfactory fossa asymmetry was low in group I, it was not significantly different between the groups (p>0.05).  Conclusion:   In our study, high Keros I rate and low Keros III rate in children aged 1-6 were remarkable.

Materials and methods:   Among prospectively registered consecutive patients with acute embolic anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion treated with thrombectomy, we analyzed 108 patients admitted from January 2015 to December 2019 who underwent evaluation of leptomeningeal collateral status on pretreatment CTA. Clinical characteristics, extent of leukoaraiosis on MR imaging, embolic stroke subtype, time of imaging, occlusive thrombus characteristics, presenting stroke severity, and clinical outcome were collected.

The diagnostic accuracy of transcranial Doppler flow velocity values in detecting angiographic vasospasm in patients requiring urgent endovascular intervention has not been established.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of patients with aneurysmal SAH who underwent transcranial Doppler (index test) within 24 hours of conventional angiography (reference test). The judgment of 33%, 50%, and 66% degree of vessel narrowing on angiography was independently established by multiple neuroendovascular clinicians. Vessel-specific per-segment and per-patient transcranial Doppler velocities were studied using receiver operating characteristic curves, the Youden index, and minimal acceptable sensitivity models. Optimal mean flow-velocity thresholds were explored to calculate sensitivity and specificity using a per-patient judgment of vasospasm of at least 50% angiographic narrowing in any large arterial segment except A1.  Results:   In 221 patients, vasospasm was found in 15%, 8%, and 4% of arteries when the degree of reference angiographic luminal narrowing was 33%, 50%, and 66%, respectively. Mean flow velocities were significantly higher in vasospastic segments (P = . 001), but per-segment exploratory analyses yielded unsound mean flow velocity thresholds. The Youden and minimal acceptable sensitivity models proposed mean flow velocity thresholds of approximately 160 cm/s for the anterior circulation and 80 cm/s for the posterior circulation in the per-patient diagnosis of angiographic vasospasm (≥50%), yielding a sensitivity of 80%-90% (95% CI, 0.77-0.96), but with a corresponding specificity of 50% (95% CI, 0.40-0.56).

Periarticular external fixation (PAEF) appears to produce good results, but the outcomes with the TL-HEX Trauma™ (Orthofix®, Verona, Italy) have not yet been evaluated. We performed a study with the following objectives: 1) evaluate time to union and union rate; 2) determine clinical and radiological results; 3) detect complications.  Hypothesis:   PAEF will produce comparable fracture union to other external fixator techniques for tibial pilon fractures.  Methods:   A single center, retrospective study, was done between June 2016 and December 2018. Patients who had a tibial pilon fracture operated with a PAEF were included if they had a minimum of 12 months' follow-up. Forty-seven patients were included; the mean follow-up was 2.45 years (1.2-3.7). The primary endpoint was the time to union and union rate at the final assessment. The secondary endpoints were the joint range of motion, residual pain (VAS), functional scores (AOFAS and SF12) and complication rate.  Results:   The union rate was 70% (33/47) and the mean time to union was 201±79 days (89-369). The range of motion was significantly reduced relative to the contralateral side. Twenty patients had residual pain that averaged 2.9 (1-6) on the VAS. The mean AOFAS score was 74 points (51-95). Twenty patients (43%) suffered at least one complication.  Discussion:   While a PAEF helps to avoid skin complications, in our study, it was associated with a lower union rate and longer time to union than in other published studies. This difference is likely due to a higher rate of open fractures and high-energy trauma in our study, different protocol for return to weightbearing and a different external fixator than other studies. This is the first study reporting the results of the TL-HEX Trauma in this indication.

This study aimed to estimate diagnostic and therapeutic costs of patients with a diagnosis of or suspected of COVID-19 disease admitted to hospitals in northeast Iran.  Methods:   This descriptive and analytical research was conducted as a retrospective study using the data collected from 2980 patients admitted to 30 hospitals from February to April 2020 in Iran. For data collection, an appropriate data capture tool was designed to record detailed resource use. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the treatment costs and sociodemographic, disease severity, and underlying diseases. Data were analyzed using Excel 2017 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and SPSS version 21 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).  Results:   The inpatient costs per patient were Int$416, of which 74% were paid by social health insurance systems, 19% by the government, and 7% by the patients. The largest cost components were hoteling (37%) and medicine (36%). The 4 subscales of age, sex, underlying disease, and severity predicted 48.6% of the cost variance.  Conclusion:   Understanding the economic consequences of diseases can help policymakers to make plans to reduce out-of-pocket payments and make plans for funding. Since COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease and there is no definitive cure for the disease, the discovery of an effective medicine may alter medical costs and reduce the hospital length of stay, therefore significantly reducing treatment costs.""","""['Hosein Ebrahimipour', 'Hassan Haghparast-Bidgoli', 'Shapour Badiee Aval', 'Seyed Javad Hoseini', 'Sara Jamili', 'Zahra Ebnehoseini', 'Marjan Vejdani', 'Amin Adel']""","""[' Social Determinates of Health Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, England, UK.', ' Department of Complementary and Chinese Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', ' Health Management and Economics Research Center, Health Management Research Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

For primary PAs: The mean patient age was 50 years (female/male: 2/1), the median size was 2.1 cm (range: 0.5 to 9.0 cm), and the most common location was the parotid (92%). Tumors showed the following: complete encapsulation (25%), involvement of the surrounding salivary gland/fat (74%), hypercellularity (26%), ≥10 pseudopods (15%), squamous metaplasia (43%), mitoses (49%), intravascular tumor deposit (n=1), close proximity to nerves (n=2), positive margin (15%), and suboptimal resection (2%). The recurrence rate was 3.4% and malignant transformation was <1%. On univariate analysis, age below 30, mitosis ≥3/10 HPFs, squamous metaplasia, hypercellularity, and suboptimal resection correlated with recurrence-free survival. On multivariate analysis, only age below 30, mitosis ≥3/10 HPF and suboptimal resection predicted recurrence. For recurrent PAs: The resected primary PAs were fragmented in 58%.

Reviewers classified green pixelation according to anatomic location, shape (linear, stippled, angular, oval), and height and width ratio. In session 2, green pixelation confined to the tendon was evaluated (shape, height and width ratio, occupied area in the tendon, accompanied peritendinous green pixelation).  Results:   In session 1, while tophi were noted at various locations, almost all clumpy artifacts were located at the tendon (99%, p < 0.0001). Most clumpy artifacts were linear, stippled, and wide, while most tophi were angular and oval (p < 0.05). In session 2, the shape of green pixelation from clumpy artifacts and tophi was significantly different (p < 0.0001) and most clumpy artifacts occupied less than 50% of the tendon (p = 0.02), and most tophi were accompanied by peritendinous green pixelation (p < 0.0001). Univariant logistic regression showed that tophi were significantly correlated with peritendinous deposits, angular and oval shape, and more than 50% of the tendon (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Clumpy artifacts can be differentiated from tophi in DECT. Clumpy artifacts typically are located in the tendon with a linear or stippled shape, wide, and less than 50% of a tendon's cross-section. Tophi, on the other hand, typically are oval, larger than 50% of the tendon's cross-section, and associated with adjacent peritendinous green pixelation.

It is identified by radiologists through visual inspection of preoperative MR imaging scans and has been shown to identify isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant 1p/19q noncodeleted gliomas with a high positive predictive value. We have developed an approach to quantify the T2-FLAIR mismatch signature and use it to predict the molecular status of lower-grade gliomas.  Materials and methods:   We used multiparametric MR imaging scans and segmentation labels of 108 preoperative lower-grade glioma tumors from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Clinical information and T2-FLAIR mismatch sign labels were obtained from supplementary material of relevant publications. We adopted an objective analytic approach to estimate this sign through a geographically weighted regression and used the residuals for each case to construct a probability density function (serving as a residual signature). These functions were then analyzed using an appropriate statistical framework.  Results:   We observed statistically significant (P value = .05) differences between the averages of residual signatures for an isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant 1p/19q noncodeleted class of tumors versus other categories. Our classifier predicts these cases with area under the curve of 0.98 and high specificity and sensitivity. It also predicts the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign within these cases with an under the curve of 0.93.  Conclusions:   On the basis of this retrospective study, we show that geographically weighted regression-based residual signatures are highly informative of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and can identify isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status with high predictive power. The utility of the proposed quantification of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign can be potentially validated through a prospective multi-institutional study.""","""['S Mohammed', 'V Ravikumar', 'E Warner', 'S H Patel', 'S Bakas', 'A Rao', 'R Jain']""","""[' From the Departments of Biostatistics (S.M., A.R.) ukarvind@umich.edu.', ' Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics (S.M., V.R., E.W., A.R.).', ' Department of Radiology & Medical Imaging (S.H.P.), University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia.', ' Departments of Radiology (S.B.).', ' Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (S.B.), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ' Radiation Oncology (A.R.).', ' Michigan Institute for Data Sciences (A.R.).', ' Department of Biomedical Engineering (A.R.), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', ' Departments of Radiology (R.J.).', '0 Neurosurgery (R.J.), New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""AJNR Am J Neuroradiol""","""['The T2-FLAIR-mismatch sign as an imaging biomarker for IDH and 1p/19q status in diffuse low-grade gliomas: a systematic review with a Bayesian approach to evaluation of diagnostic test performance.', 'Advanced imaging parameters improve the prediction of diffuse lower-grade gliomas subtype, IDH mutant with no 1p19q codeletion: added value to the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign.', 'The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign as a predictor of IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-noncodeleted lower-grade gliomas: a systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Radiogenomic association between the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and IDH mutation status in adult patients with lower-grade gliomas: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Predictive accuracy of T2-FLAIR mismatch sign for the IDH-mutant, 1p/19q noncodeleted low-grade glioma: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The immunotherapy advancement targeting malignant blastomas in early childhood.', 'Generalized Geographically Weighted Regression Model within a Modularized Bayesian Framework.', 'A Pipeline for the Implementation and Visualization of Explainable Machine Learning for Medical Imaging Using Radiomics Features.']"""

This study aimed to compare the MRI findings at follow-up between EBP effective and non-effective groups and to identify imaging findings that predict EBP treatment failure.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients who received EBP treatment for spinal CSF leakage. These patients were stratified into two groups: EBP effective (n = 27) and EBP non-effective (n = 21) using the results of the 3 month MRI as the end point.  Results:   Compared to the EBP non-effective group, the patients in the EBP effective group had a lower spinal CSF leakage number (2.67 vs 12.48; p = 0.001), lower spinal epidural fluid accumulation levels (3.00 vs 7.48; p = 0.004), brain descend (11.11% vs 38.10%; p = 0.027), pituitary hyperemia (18.52% vs 57.14%; p = 0.007), and decreased likelihood of ≥three numbers of spinal CSF leakage (25.93% vs 90.48%; p = 0.001) in the post-EBP MRI. Clinical non-responsiveness (OR: 57.84; 95% CI: 3.47-972.54; p = 0.005) and ≥three numbers of spinal CSF leakage (OR: 15.13; 95% CI: 1.45-159.06; p = 0.023) were associated with EBP failure. Between these variables, ≥three numbers of spinal CSF leakage identified using the post-EBP MRI demonstrated greater sensitivity in predicting EBP failure compared to clinical non-responsiveness (90.48% vs 61.9%).  Conclusion:   The number of spinal CSF leakage identified using the post-EBP MRI with a cut-off value of three is an effective predictor of EBP failure.

The best classifiers that distinguished helpful approaches were further analyzed using qualitative coding according to a grounded theory approach.  Results:   NLP reliably and accurately classified the perceived helpfulness of caregivers' feeding strategies (82%) and provided information about features of helpful parent strategies using recollections of adults with varying degrees of food avoidance. Strategies perceived as forceful were regarded as not helpful. Positive and encouraging strategies were perceived as helpful in improving attitudes toward food and minimizing social discomfort around eating. Although food variety improved, adults still struggled with a degree of avoidance/restriction.  Discussion:   Adults perceived that positive parent feeding strategies were helpful even though they continued to experience some degree of food avoidance.

We measured peak intensity (PEAK), time-to-peak (TP), area under the curve (AUC) and mean transit time (MTT) of renal CEUS in each patient. Each parameter was performed by two independent observers. The interobserver reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and Bland-Altman plots by mean difference with 95% limits of agreement (LOAs).

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a CT-based radiomics nomogram for the pre-operative differentiation of RO from chRCC.  Methods:   A total of 141 patients (84 in training data set and 57 in external validation data set) with ROs (n = 47) or chRCCs (n = 94) were included. Radiomics features were extracted from tri-phasic enhanced-CT images. A clinical model was developed based on significant patient characteristics and CT imaging features. A radiomics signature model was developed and a radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. A radiomics nomogram model incorporating the Rad-score and independent clinical factors was developed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic performance was evaluated and validated in three models using ROC curves.  Results:   Twelve features from CT images were selected to develop the radiomics signature. The radiomics nomogram combining a clinical factor (segmental enhancement inversion) and radiomics signature showed an AUC value of 0.988 in the validation set. Decision curve analysis revealed that the diagnostic performance of the radiomics nomogram was better than the clinical model and the radiomics signature.  Conclusions:   The radiomics nomogram combining clinical factors and radiomics signature performed well for distinguishing RO from chRCC.

Radiation therapy (RT) has an important role because SCV nodes are not routinely surgically dissected. However, optimal locoregional management, contemporary outcomes, and prognostic factors are not well defined.  Methods and materials:   We reviewed the data of patients with cN3c breast cancer treated at our institution between 2014 and 2019 with curative intent, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant RT. All patients received comprehensive regional RT, including to the SCV nodes. Institutional guidelines recommend a 10-Gy or 16-Gy boost to resolved and unresolved N3 nodes, respectively. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), and supraclavicular recurrence-free survival (SCRFS) were analyzed.  Results:   Data from 173 consecutive patients were analyzed with a median follow-up time of 2.8 years. The median age was 54 years, 76 patients (44%) were estrogen receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, 100 patients (58%) had T3/4 disease, and 10 patients (6%) underwent a neck dissection. In addition, 156 patients (90%) received a cumulative SCV dose of ≥60 Gy. The 5-year OS, SCRFS, LRRFS, and RFS rates were 73%, 95%, 86%, and 50%, respectively. The 5-year OS rate for a cumulative SCV dose of ≥60 Gy versus <60 Gy was 75% versus 39% (P = .04). In the multivariable analysis, a cumulative SCV dose of ≥60 Gy, extranodal extension, receptor status, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status were associated with OS. The 5-year SCRFS rates with and without neck dissection were 100% versus 95% (P = .57). Among patients with a postchemotherapy SCV node size of ≥1 cm without neck dissection, the 5-year SCRFS rate was 83%.  Conclusions:   In one of the largest series of patients with cN3c breast cancer, multimodality therapy using adjuvant RT with a SCV boost resulted in a 5-year LRRFS rate of 86%. There is a limited role for neck dissection as the 5-year SCRFS rate was 95% overall and 83% for residual SCV disease ≥1 cm after chemotherapy with RT alone. A cumulative SCV dose of ≥60 Gy was associated with improved OS, but not SCRFS, LRRFS, or RFS. A SCV boost should be considered in these patients as treatment was well-tolerated. Despite advances in systemic therapy, nearly half of patients developed distant metastases, highlighting the need for close observation after treatment.""","""['Kevin Diao', 'Lauren M Andring', 'Carlos H Barcenas', 'Puneet Singh', 'Huong Carisa Le-Petross', 'Valerie K Reed', 'Jay P Reddy', 'Elizabeth S Bloom', 'Neelofur R Ahmad', 'Lauren L Mayo', 'George H Perkins', 'Melissa P Mitchell', 'Kevin T Nead', 'Welela Tereffe', 'Benjamin D Smith', 'Wendy A Woodward']""","""[' Department of Radiation Oncology.

This work presents a learning-based method to synthesize DECT images from SECT image for proton radiotherapy.  Methods:   The proposed method uses a residual attention generative adversarial network. Residual blocks with attention gates were used to force the model to focus on the difference between DECT images and SECT images. To evaluate the accuracy of the method, we retrospectively investigated 70 head-and-neck cancer patients whose DECT and SECT scans were acquired simultaneously. The model was trained to generate both a high and low energy DECT image based on a SECT image. The generated synthetic low and high DECT images were evaluated against the true DECT images using leave-one-out cross-validation. To evaluate our method in the context of a practical application, we generated SPR maps from synthetic DECT (sDECT) using a dual-energy based stoichiometric method and compared the SPR maps to those generated from DECT. A dosimetric comparison for dose obtained from DECT was performed against that derived from sDECT.  Results:   The mean of mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and normalized cross-correlation for the synthetic high and low energy CT images was 36.9 HU, 29.3 dB, 0.96 and 35.8 HU, 29.2 dB, and 0.96, respectively. The corresponding SPR maps generated from synthetic DECT showed an average normalized mean square deviation of about 1% with reduced noise level and artifacts than those from original DECT. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics for the clinical target volume agree within 1% between the DECT and sDECT calculated dose.  Conclusion:   Our method synthesized accurate DECT images and showed a potential feasibility for proton SPR map generation.

Patient concerns:   A 46-year-old woman was referred to our hospital after incidental finding of multiple pulmonary cavitations with surrounding areas of ground glass opacity on a thoraco-abdominal computed tomography-scan performed for abdominal pain. Retrospectively, the patient also reported mild hemoptysis occurring 4 months ago.  Diagnoses:   Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan revealed moderate and homogeneous [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake in pulmonary cavitations (maximum standardized uptake value 5.7). The diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis was confirmed by histological examination of surgical resection of a left lower lobe cavitation.  Interventions and outcome:   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues associated with add-back therapy was started. Four months after initiating pharmacological treatment, the chest computed tomography-scan showed a dramatic decrease in lung cavitations size.  Lessons:   Thoracic endometriosis is a rare disorder requiring a multidisciplinary management including gynaecologist, pulmonologist, radiologist, nuclear physician, pathologist and thoracic surgeon for early diagnosis and treatment.

This can be explained by the small number of studies using an adapted model.  Methods:   We used two original designs to study the female and male effects on embryo development: (1) based on embryos from donor oocytes (TL-DO), and (2) from donor sperm (TL-DS). Firstly, we analyzed the female and male similarities using an ad hoc intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), then we completed the analysis with a multivariable model to assess the association between both male and female factors, and early embryo kinetics. A total of 572 mature oocytes (TL-DO: 293; TL-DS: 279), fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and incubated in a TL (Embryoscope®) were included from March 2013 to April 2019; 429 fertilized oocytes (TL-DO: 212; TL-DS: 217) were assessed. The timings of the first 48 h have been analyzed.  Results:   The similarities in the timings thought to be related to the female component were significant: (ICC in both DO-DS designs respectively: tPB2: 9-18%; tPNa: 16-21%; tPNf: 40-26%; t2: 38-24%; t3: 15-20%; t4: 21-32%). Comparatively, those related to male were lower. Surprisingly after multivariable analyses, no intrinsic female factors were clearly identified. However, in TL-DO design, oligozoospermia was associated with a tendency to longer timings, notably for tPB2 (p = 0.026).

Methods:   This retrospective study included all patients with PNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before video-assisted thoracoscopic urgery (VATS) resection from June 2016 to December 2019 in our institution. The microcoil distal end was less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the microcoil proximal end was in the pleural cavity (the pleural cavity group) or chest wall (the chest wall group). The length of microcoil outside the pleura was measured and divided into less than 0.5 cm (group A), 0.5 to 2 cm (group B) and more than 2 cm (group C). Microcoil dislocation was defined as complete retraction into the lung (type I) or complete withdrawal from the lung (type II). The rate of microcoil dislocation between different groups was compared.  Results:   A total of 519 consecutive patients with 571 PNs were included in this study. According to the position of microcoils proximal end on post-marking CT, there were 95 microcoils in the pleural cavity group and 476 in the chest wall group. The number of microcoils in group A, B, and C were 67, 448 and 56, respectively. VATS showed dislocation of 42 microcoils, of which 30 were type II and 12 were type I. There was no statistical difference in the rate of microcoil dislocation between the pleural cavity group and the chest wall group (6.3% vs 7.6%, x2 = 0.18, p = 0.433). The difference in the rate of microcoil dislocation among group A, B, and C was statistically significant (11.9%, 5.8%, and 14.3% for group A, B, and C, respectively, x2 = 7.60, p = 0.008). In group A, 75% (6/8) of dislocations were type I, while all eight dislocations were type II in group C.  Conclusions:   During CT-guided microcoil localization of PNs, placing the microcoil proximal end in the pleura cavity or chest wall had no significant effect on the incidence of microcoil dislocation. The length of microcoil outside the pleura should be 0.5 to 2 cm to reduce the rate of microcoil dislocation.  Advances in knowledge::   CT-guided microcoil localization can effectively guide VATS to resect invisible and impalpable PNs. Microcoil dislocation is the main cause of localization failure. The length of microcoil outside the pleura is significantly correlated with the rate and type of microcoil dislocation. Placing the microcoil proximal end in the pleura cavity or chest wall has no significant effect on the rate of microcoil dislocation.""","""['Zhen-Guo Huang', 'Cun-Li Wang', 'Hong-Liang Sun', 'Shu-Zhu Qin', 'Chuan-Dong Li', 'Bao-Xiang Gao']""","""[' Department of Radiology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', ' Department of Radiology, Baotou Third Hospital, Baotou, China.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Br J Radiol""","""['CT-Guided Microcoil Localization of Small Peripheral Pulmonary Nodules to Direct Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection without the Aid of Intraoperative Fluoroscopy.', 'CT-guided microcoil localization for pulmonary nodules before VATS: a retrospective evaluation of risk factors for pleural marking failure.', 'Peripheral lung nodules: fluoroscopically guided video-assisted thoracoscopic resection after computed tomography-guided localization using platinum microcoils.', 'CT-guided localization of small pulmonary nodules using adjacent microcoil implantation prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection.', 'CT-guided preoperative localization of ground glass nodule: comparison between the application of embolization microcoil and the locating needle designed for pulmonary nodules.']"""

The underlying physiological mechanisms by which chronic stress confers this increased risk remain unclear. The present study aimed to characterize the impact of chronic and race-related stress exposure on regulatory mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in response to acute stress, to examine John Henryism as potential moderator of this relationship, and to investigate the association between ANS reactivity and subsequent drug use among a sample of African American emerging adults (18-25 years old) in the Southern United States (U.S.).  Method:   Participants (N = 276) completed self-report measures of chronic and race-related stress and John Henryism and underwent a laboratory-based stressor. ANS reactivity was assessed via heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance levels (SCL). At 90-day follow-up, retrospective reports of drug use were provided.  Results:   Race-related stress was associated with greater SCL reactivity. John Henryism moderated the relationship between chronic stress exposure and HRV reactivity. SCL reactivity was associated with higher rates of alcohol and marijuana use at 90-day follow-up. HRV reactivity was associated with tobacco use at 90-day follow-up.  Conclusions:   Chronic stress exposure and active coping may interact to affect regulatory mechanisms of the ANS. ANS (dys)regulation may be an important endophenotype for increasing drug use vulnerability among African American emerging adults.

There is no technique to quantify aortic growth in a three-dimensional (3D) manner. Purpose To validate a CT-based technique for quantification of 3D growth based on deformable registration in patients with TAA. Materials and Methods Patients with ascending and descending TAA with two or more CT angiography studies between 2006 and 2020 were retrospectively identified. The 3D aortic growth was quantified using vascular deformation mapping (VDM), a technique that uses deformable registration to warp a mesh constructed from baseline aortic anatomy. Growth assessments between VDM and clinical CT diameter measurements were compared. Aortic growth was quantified as the ratio of change in surface area at each mesh element (area ratio). Manual segmentations were performed by independent raters to assess interrater reproducibility. Registration error was assessed using manually placed landmarks. Agreement between VDM and clinical diameter measurements was assessed using Pearson correlation and Cohen κ coefficients. Results A total of 38 patients (68 surveillance intervals) were evaluated (mean age, 69 years ± 9 [standard deviation]; 21 women), with TAA involving the ascending aorta (n = 26), descending aorta (n = 10), or both (n = 2). VDM was technically successful in 35 of 38 (92%) patients and 58 of 68 intervals (85%). Median registration error was 0.77 mm (interquartile range, 0.54-1.10 mm). Interrater agreement was high for aortic segmentation (Dice similarity coefficient = 0.97 ± 0.02) and VDM-derived area ratio (bias = 0.0, limits of agreement: -0.03 to 0.03). There was strong agreement (r = 0.85, P < .001) between peak area ratio values and diameter change. VDM detected growth in 14 of 58 (24%) intervals. VDM revealed growth outside the maximally dilated segment in six of 14 (36%) growth intervals, none of which were detected with diameter measurements. Conclusion Vascular deformation mapping provided reliable and comprehensive quantitative assessment of three-dimensional aortic growth and growth patterns in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms undergoing CT surveillance.

Sudden chest pain may lead to a risk of misdiagnosis as an acute coronary syndrome and may lead to subsequent antiplatelet therapy (APT). We used the Chinese Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS) Collaboration Database to study the effects of APT on clinical outcomes.  Methods:   The AAS database is a retrospective multicentre database where 31 of 3092 patients had APT with aspirin or clopidogrel or both before surgery. Before and after propensity score matching (PSM), the incidence of complications and mortality was compared between APT and non-APT patients by using a logistic regression model. The sample remaining after PSM was 30 in the APT group and 80 in the non-APT group.  Results:   The sample remaining after matching was 30 in the APT group and 80 in the non-APT group. We found 10 cases with percutaneous coronary intervention in the APT group (33.3%). The APT group received more volume of packed red blood cells, 8.4 ± 6.05 units; plasma, 401.67 ± 727 ml, and platelet transfusion (14.07 ± 8.92 units). The drainage volume was much more in the APT group (5009.37 ± 2131.44 ml, p = .004). Mortality was higher in APT group (26% vs. 10%, p = .027). The preoperative APT was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio: 6.808, 95% confidence interval: 1.554-29.828, p = .011).  Conclusion:   APT before ATAAD repair was associated with more transfusions and higher early mortality.

Methods:   A mixed-methods analysis of pediatric home pulse oximetry orders prescribed through the institutional home healthcare provider at a large US children's hospital 6/2018-7/2019 was retrospectively reviewed to determine prescribed alarm parameter limits and recommended interventions. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with pediatric providers managing patients receiving home oxygen and pulse oximetry were conducted to identify opportunities to improve home pulse oximetry prescribing practices. Interviews were analyzed using a modified content analysis approach to identify recurring themes.  Results:   A total of 368 children received home pulse oximetry orders. Orders were most frequently prescribed on noncardiac medical floors (32%). Attending physicians were the most frequent ordering providers (52%). Frequency of use was prescribed in 96% of orders, however, just 70% were provided with specific instructions for interventions when alarms occurred. Provider role and clinical setting were significantly associated with the presence of a care plan. Provider interviews identified opportunities for improvement with the device, management of alarm parameter limits, and access to home monitor data.  Discussion:   This study demonstrated significant variability in home pulse oximetry prescribing practices. Provider interviews highlighted the importance of the provider-patient relationship and areas for improvement.

Hence, increased SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these patients.Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients.

Experimental design:   We generated a library of 10 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoid lines: five each from treatment-naïve and FOLFIRINOX-treated patients. We first assessed the histologic, genetic, and transcriptional characteristics of the organoids and their matched primary PDAC tissue. Next, the organoids' response to treatment with single agents-5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin-of the FOLFIRINOX regimen as well as combined regimen was evaluated. Finally, global mRNA-seq analyses were performed to identify FOLFIRINOX resistance pathways.  Results:   All 10 patient-derived PDAC organoids recapitulate histologic, genetic, and transcriptional characteristics of their primary tumor tissue. Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX-treated organoids display resistance to FOLFIRINOX (5/5), irinotecan (5/5), and oxaliplatin (4/5) when compared with treatment-naïve organoids (FOLFIRINOX: 1/5, irinotecan: 2/5, oxaliplatin: 0/5). 5-Fluorouracil treatment responses between naïve and treated organoids were similar. Comparative global transcriptome analysis of treatment-naïve and FOLFIRINOX samples-in both organoids and corresponding matched tumor tissues-uncovered modulated pathways mainly involved in genomic instability, energy metabolism, and innate immune system.  Conclusions:   Resistance development in neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX organoids, recapitulating their primary tumor resistance, suggests continuation of FOLFIRINOX therapy as an adjuvant treatment may not be advantageous for these patients.

Microsurgical replantation remains the gold standard of thumb reconstruction techniques. The non-microsurgical technical variants of thumb reconstruction described so far aim to create a neo-thumb of adequate length, stable, opposable, sensitive, and last but not least esthetically pleasing appearance. Avulsion of the distal phalanx and the absence of the nail will determine a functional deficit but also an unesthetic appearance. When replantation is not possible or the patient refuses to ""sacrifice"" another anatomical region for thumb reconstruction, the ""reposition-flap"" technique can be used. Although often controversial, this surgical technique deserves proper attention and should be used in some cases. We studied a group of 32 patients with distal thumb amputations. In patients with amputations in zone II according to Tamai, with interphalangeal joint preservation, the thumb was reconstructed using ""reposition-flap"" with an O'Brien flap in 15 cases. In the remaining 17 cases where the amputation was at the level of the interphalangeal joint, we used the same technique, but the thumb neopulp was reconstructed with the Littler heterodigital neurovascular flap harvested from the ulnar border of the middle finger in 11 cases or radial border of the ring finger in 6 cases. The results were evaluated from a functional (Kapandji score), sensitive (2-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein test) but also esthetically (patient satisfaction) point of view. Donor site morbidity, cold intolerance, the presence of nail dystrophy, and bone resorbtion were also assessed. The disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score was evaluated for each patient.

However, the relationship between VAH and ischemic stroke remains unknown. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of VAH in patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke who were followed up in a neurology clinic and to determine if it can potentially be a risk factor for atherosclerotic stenosis in vertebrobasilar circulation.This retrospective study included 609 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020. Demographic of patients, risk factors, radiological and clinical characteristics were evaluated.Posterior circulation was very common in patients with VAH, and the most common locations of atherosclerotic stenosis were V1 and V4 segments of the vertebral artery and the middle segment of basilar artery. Analysis of the risk factors for atherosclerotic stenosis in patients with posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke suggested that VAH was an independent risk factor.Findings of the study suggest that VAH pre-disposes atherosclerotic stenosis in vertebrobasilar circulation, although its mechanism remains unknown. Hemodynamic parameters associated with atherosclerosis could not be measured in vivo. Thus, to better understand the underlying mechanism, conducting studies that examine blood flow parameters with high-resolution magnetic resonance angiography in patients diagnosed with acute cerebral ischemia patients with VAH is warranted.""","""['Yasemin Dinç', 'Rifat Özpar', 'Büşra Emir', 'Bahattin Hakyemez', 'Mustafa Bakar']""","""[' Uludağ University Medicine Faculty, Department of Neurology, Turkey.', ' Uludağ University Medicine Faculty, Department of Radiology, Turkey.', ' Izmir Katip Celebi University, Department of Biostatistic, Turkey.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Relationship between Vertebral Artery Hypoplasia and Posterior Circulation Ischemia.', 'Association between vertebral artery hypoplasia and posterior circulation stroke.', 'The effect of vertebral artery hypoplasia in posterior circulation infarction in young patients.', 'Is vertebral artery hypoplasia a predisposing factor for posterior circulation cerebral ischemic events?

However, the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) with regard to PCa has rarely been mentioned.To investigate the capability of the MLR to predict PCa.Patients who were pathologically diagnosed with PCa in our hospital and healthy control subjects who conformed to the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Patient data were recorded, including age, complete blood counts, blood biochemistry, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The differences in these data between the groups were analyzed and the diagnostic value of the MLR was compared with PSA.Our study included a total of 100 patients with PCa and 103 healthy control subjects. Patients with PCa presented with a significantly higher NLR, MLR, and PLR compared to control subjects. However, the hemoglobin and lymphocyte levels were lower (P < .05) in PCa patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of PSA and ratio of free/total serum prostate-specific antigen were 0.899 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.857-0.942) and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.818-0.926), respectively, while the AUC of the MLR was 0.852 (95% CI: 0.798-0.906), which was higher than that of the NLR, PLR, and any other blood parameters. Additionally, the optimal cut-off value of the MLR for PCa was 0.264, with a specificity of 87.4% and a sensitivity of 72.0%. An evaluation of the diagnostic value of MLR + PSA gave an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI: 0.902-0.970). However, the AUC of MLR + PSA + f/tPSA was 0.996 (95% CI: 0.991-1.000). The diagnostic value of MLR + NLR + PSA gave an AUC of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.913-0.977), and the specificity is 0.971.PSA remains the most important diagnostic indicator. MLR combined with PSA and f/tPSA has the higher predictive value than PSA. It suggests that MLR may be another good predictive indicator of PCa.

Development of methods to mitigate checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis is required.The contributions of PD-L1, PD-L2, and VEGF to the pathogenesis of pneumonitis were examined in an IL2- plus IL18-induced mouse pneumonitis model (IL pneumonitis model). Furthermore, the incidences of pneumonitis were retrospectively examined in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with the anti-PD-L1 mAb atezolizumab plus chemotherapy, with or without the anti-VEGF mAb bevacizumab, in the phase III IMpower150 trial. PD-1 signal blockade by anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 antibodies aggravated pneumonitis in the IL pneumonitis model. An anti-VEGF antibody prevented PD-1 signal blockade from aggravating pneumonitis in this model. PD-1 signal blockade induced interstitial T-cell infiltration in the lungs, but VEGF blockade did not affect this T-cell infiltration. The anti-VEGF antibody protected against vascular-to-alveolar leakage of protein and fluid due to PD-1 signal blockade in a murine model. In the IMpower150 trial, incidence rates of pneumonitis of any grade were 4.3% in the group without bevacizumab and 2.8% in the group with bevacizumab. In patients with pneumonitis, outcomes of ""Not recovered/Not resolved"" were reported for 29.4% in the group without bevacizumab compared with 9.1% in the group with bevacizumab.

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy and complication rates of treatment using suture tape circumferential cerclage (STCC) and metallic wire circumferential cerclage (MWCC) for the surgical treatment of displaced transverse patellar fractures (TPFs).  Hypothesis:   The hypothesis is that the use of the suture tape would be associated with a significantly lower rate of re-operation than metallic cerclage but no differences in other clinical outcomes.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective comparative analysis of the clinical outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing fixation of TPFs with either MWCC or STCC between January 2017 and December 2018 was undertaken. All patients underwent evaluation with standardised radiographs at one, three, and six months after surgery to determine rates of union, non-union, loss of fixation and malunion. All patients underwent a final clinical evaluation at 18 months postoperatively to evaluate clinical scores and complications.  Results:   A total of 26 patients were included in the study. Thirteen patients underwent STCC and 13 underwent MWCC. There were no complications in the STCC group. In the MWCC group, one patient underwent hardware removal at 2 months postoperatively due to painful prominence. There was no significant difference in re-operation rates between the STCC and MWCC groups (p=1). There were no cases of non-union, malunion or loss of fixation throughout the series. At the final clinical follow-up of 18months, there were no significant differences in KSS, KOOS or Böstman scores between the groups.  Conclusion:   No significant differences were identified when comparing the clinical outcomes of fixation of AO/OTA 34C1/2 fractures with suture tape or metallic cerclage fixation concerning re-operation rates, union rates, loss of fixation and functional outcome measures.

Decreases in platelets following CRRT initiation are common and are associated with mortality, but associations with renal recovery are unclear. Our objective was to determine if platelet nadir or the degree of platelet decrease following CRRT initiation was associated with renal nonrecovery.  Methods:   This is a secondary analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) trial. Primary predictors were platelet nadir discretized by median value and percent platelet decrease following CRRT initiation, with cut points evaluated by decile from 30 to 60%. The 2 primary outcomes were time to RRT-independence and RRT-free days. Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU)-free, and hospital-free days.  Results:   Time to RRT independence censored for death was achieved less frequently in patients with low platelet nadir (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.91) and in those with >50% platelet decrease (HR 0.84, CI 0.72-0.97). RRT-free days were lower in both low platelet nadir (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, CI 0.90-0.97) and >50% platelet decrease (OR 0.91, CI 0.88-0.95). These groups also had higher rates of 28- and 90-day mortality and fewer ICU-free and hospital-free days. Thrombocytopenia at CRRT initiation was also associated with renal nonrecovery, although the clinical effect was small.  Conclusions:   Platelet nadir <100 × 103/µL and platelet decrease by >50% following CRRT initiation were both associated with lower rates of renal recovery.

Research design and methods:   With Cox proportional hazards models we examined the relationship between initial T2DM remission and percent total weight loss (%TWL) after bariatric surgery. Categories of %TWL were included in the model as time-varying covariates.  Results:   Of patients (N = 5,928), 73% were female; mean age was 49.8 ± 10.3 years and BMI 43.8 ± 6.92 kg/m2, and 57% had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Over an average follow-up of 5.9 years, 71% of patients experienced initial remission of T2DM (mean time to remission 1.0 year). With 0-5% TWL used as the reference group in Cox proportional hazards models, patients were more likely to remit with each 5% increase in TWL until 20% TWL (hazard ratio range 1.97-2.92). When categories >25% TWL were examined, all patients had a likelihood of initial remission similar to that of 20-25% TWL. Patients who achieved >20% TWL were more likely to achieve initial T2DM remission than patients with 0-5% TWL, even if they were using insulin at the time of surgery.  Conclusions:   Weight loss after bariatric surgery is strongly associated with initial T2DM remission; however, above a threshold of 20% TWL, rates of initial T2DM remission did not increase substantially. Achieving this threshold is also associated with initial remission even in patients who traditionally experience lower rates of remission, such as patients taking insulin.""","""['Douglas Barthold', 'Elizabeth Brouwer', 'Lee J Barton', 'David E Arterburn', 'Anirban Basu', 'Anita Courcoulas', 'Cecelia L Crawford', 'Peter N Fedorka', 'Heidi Fischer', 'Benjamin B Kim', 'Edward C Mun', 'Sameer B Murali', 'Kristi Reynolds', 'Tae K Yoon', 'Robert E Zane', 'Karen J Coleman']""","""[' 1Department of Pharmacy, The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ' 2Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA.', ' 3Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, WA.', ' 4Departments of Health Services and Economics, The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ' 5Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.', ' 6Regional Nursing Research Program, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA.', ' 7Department of Surgery, Kaiser Permanente San Bernardino Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Ontario, CA.', ' 8Department of Surgery, Kaiser Permanente South Bay Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Harbor City, CA.', ' 9Center for Healthy Living, Kaiser Permanente San Bernardino Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Fontana, CA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Diabetes Care""","""['Weighing in on Type 2 Diabetes Remission.', 'Five-Year-Results of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenojejunal Bypass for Weight Loss and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.', 'Metabolic effects of bariatric surgery on patients with type 2 diabetes: a population-based study.', 'Comparative Safety and Effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy for Weight Loss and Type 2 Diabetes Across Race and Ethnicity in the PCORnet Bariatric Study Cohort.', 'Effect of revisional bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Factors affecting relapse of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery in Sweden 2007-2015: a registry-based cohort study.', 'The Evolution of Diabetes Treatment Through the Ages: From Starvation Diets to Insulin, Incretins, SGLT2-Inhibitors and Beyond.', 'Remission and Relapse of Dyslipidemia After Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Population.', 'Total Diet Replacement Within an Integrated Intensive Lifestyle Intervention for Remission of Type 2 Diabetes: Lessons From DiRECT.', 'Cohort profile: The Bariatric Experience Long Term (BELONG): a long-term prospective study to understand the psychosocial, environmental, health and behavioural predictors of weight loss and regain in patients who have bariatric surgery.']"""

Methods:   Forty two adult patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups: FIO2 < 0.7 or >0.85. Under stable general anesthesia, thermodilution-derived cardiac output (TD-CO), SvO2, venous partial pressure of oxygen, hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and blood pH levels were recorded before surgical incision.  Results:   Significant differences in FIO2 values were observed between the 2 groups (0.56 ± 0.08 in the <70% group and 0.92 ± 0.03 in the >0.85 group; P < .001). The increasing FIO2 values lead to increases in SvO2, venous partial pressure of oxygen, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen, with little effects on cardiac output and hemoglobin levels. When comparing to TD-CO, the calculated Fick-CO in both groups had moderate Pearson correlations and similar linear regression results. Although the FIO2 <0.7 group presented a less mean bias and a smaller limits of agreement, neither group met the percentage error criteria of <30% in Bland-Altman analysis.  Conclusion:   Increased FIO2 may influence the interpretation of SvO2 and the exacerbation of Fick-CO estimation, which could affect clinical management.

Due to overlapping clinical risk factors, identifying high-risk patients with OSA who are likely to develop CVD remains challenging. We aimed to identify baseline clinical factors associated with the future development of CVD in patients with OSA.  Study design:   Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 967 adults aged 45 to 84 years and enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Six machine learning models were created using baseline clinical factors initially identified by stepwise variable selection. The performance of these models for the prediction of additional risk of CVD in OSA was calculated. Additionally, these models were evaluated for interpretability using locally interpretable model-agnostic explanations.  Results:   Of the 967 adults without baseline OSA or CVD, 116 were diagnosed with OSA and CVD and 851 with OSA alone 10 years after enrollment. The best performing models included random forest (sensitivity 84%, specificity 99%, balanced accuracy 91%) and bootstrap aggregation (sensitivity 84%, specificity 100%, balanced accuracy 92%). The strongest predictors of OSA and CVD versus OSA alone were fasting glucose >91 mg/dL, diastolic pressure >73 mm Hg, and age >59 years.  Conclusion:   In the selected study population of adults without OSA or CVD at baseline, the strongest predictors of CVD in patients with OSA include fasting glucose, diastolic pressure, and age.

High levels of adenosine in tumors can suppress immune cell function, and strategies to target the pathway involved in its production have emerged. CD73 is a key enzyme involved in adenosine production. This led us to identify a novel humanized antagonistic CD73 antibody, mAb19, with distinct binding properties. mAb19 potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD73 in vitro, resulting in an inhibition of adenosine formation and enhanced T-cell activation. We then investigated the therapeutic potential of combining CD73 antagonism with other immune modulatory and chemotherapeutic agents. Combination of mAb19 with a PD-1 inhibitor increased T-cell activation in vitro Interestingly, this effect could be further enhanced with an agonist of the adenosine receptor ADORA3. Adenosine levels were found to be elevated upon doxorubicin treatment in vivo, which could be blocked by CD73 inhibition. Combining CD73 antagonism with doxorubicin resulted in superior responses in vivo Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of rectal cancer patient samples demonstrated an upregulation of the adenosine pathway upon chemoradiation, providing further rationale for combining CD73 inhibition with chemotherapeutic agents.This study demonstrates the ability of a novel CD73 antibody to enhance T-cell function through the potent suppression of adenosine levels.

The index obtained from texture analysis on PET images is related to pathological change that the neuronal loss of the nigrostriatal tract is heterogeneous according to the disease state. The aim of this study is to evaluate various heterogeneity indices of F-18 FP-CIT PET images in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and to access the diagnostic accuracy of the indices using machine learning (ML).  Methods:   This retrospective study included F-18 FP-CIT PET images of 31 PD and 31 age-matched health controls (HC). The volume of interest was delineated according to iso-contour lines around standardized uptake value (SUV) 3.0 g/ml for each region of the striatum by PMod 3.603. One hundred eight heterogeneity indices were calculated using CGITA to find indices from which the PD and HC were classified using statistical significance. PD group was classified by constructing a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional phase space quantifier using these heterogeneity indices. We used 71 heterogeneity indices to classify PD from HC using ML for dimensional reduction.  Results:   The heterogeneity indices for classifying PD from HC were size-zone variability, contrast, inverse difference-moment, and homogeneity in the order of low P value. Three-dimensional quantifiers composed of normalized-contrast, code-similarity, and contrast were more clearly classified than 2-dimensional ones. After 71-dimensional reduction using PCA, classification was possible by logistic regression with 91.3% accuracy. The 2 groups were classified with an accuracy of 85.5% using the support vector machine and 88.4% using the random forest. The classification accuracy using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting was 95.7%, and feature importance was highest in order of SUV bias-corrected kurtosis, size-zone-variability, intensity-variability, and high-intensity-zone-variability.  Conclusion:   It was confirmed that PD patients is more clearly classified than the conventional 2-dimensional quantifier by introducing a 3-dimensional phase space quantifier. We observed that ML can be used to classify the 2 groups in an easy and explanatory manner. For the discrimination of the disease, 24 heterogeneity indices were found to be statistically useful, and the major cut-off values of 3 heterogeneity indices were size-zone variability (1906.44), intensity variability (129.21), and high intensity zone emphasis (800.29).""","""['Hyun Jin Yoon', 'Kook Cho', 'Woong Gon Kim', 'Young-Jin Jeong', 'Ji-Eun Jeong', 'Do-Young Kang']""","""[' Department of Nuclear Medicine, Dong-A University Medical Center, Dong-A University College of Medicine, 26 Daesingongwon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, Korea.', ' Institute of Convergence Bio-Health, Dong-A University, 26 Daesingongwon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan, Korea.', ' College of General Education, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea.', ' Economic Survey, Gyeongin Regional Statistics Office, Gwacheon, Korea.', ' Department of Translational Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 Sep""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""[""Direct comparison of FP-CIT SPECT and F-DOPA PET in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls."", ""Right putamen and age are the most discriminant features to diagnose Parkinson's disease by using 123I-FP-CIT brain SPET data by using an artificial neural network classifier, a classification tree (ClT)."", ""The phase value of putamen measured by susceptibility weighted images in Parkinson's disease and in other forms of Parkinsonism: a correlation study with F18 FP-CIT PET."", ""Precise Evaluation of Striatal Oxidative Stress Corrected for Severity of Dopaminergic Neuronal Degeneration in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Study with 62Cu-ATSM PET and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT."", ""Test-retest reproducibility of dopamine transporter density measured with 18FFP-CIT PET in patients with essential tremor and Parkinson's disease.""]"""

Recent data suggest worse oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive radical hysterectomy than after open radical hysterectomy in stage I cervical cancer.  Objective:   We aimed to compare 4.5-year disease-free survival after open vs minimally invasive radical trachelectomy.  Study design:   This was a collaborative, international retrospective study (International Radical Trachelectomy Assessment Study) of patients treated during 2005-2017 at 18 centers in 12 countries. Eligible patients had squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma; had a preoperative tumor size of ≤2 cm; and underwent open or minimally invasive (robotic or laparoscopic) radical trachelectomy with nodal assessment (pelvic lymphadenectomy and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy). The exclusion criteria included neoadjuvant chemotherapy or preoperative pelvic radiotherapy, previous lymphadenectomy or pelvic retroperitoneal surgery, pregnancy, stage IA1 disease with lymphovascular space invasion, aborted trachelectomy (conversion to radical hysterectomy), or vaginal approach. Surgical approach, indication, and adjuvant therapy regimen were at the discretion of the treating institution. A total of 715 patients were entered into the study database. However, 69 patients were excluded, leaving 646 in the analysis. Endpoints were the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate (primary), 4.5-year overall survival rate (secondary), and recurrence rate (secondary). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate disease-free survival and overall survival. A post hoc weighted analysis was performed, comparing the recurrence rates between surgical approaches, with open surgery being considered as standard and minimally invasive surgery as experimental.  Results:   Of 646 patients, 358 underwent open surgery, and 288 underwent minimally invasive surgery. The median (range) patient age was 32 (20-42) years for open surgery vs 31 (18-45) years for minimally invasive surgery (P=.11). Median (range) pathologic tumor size was 15 (0-31) mm for open surgery and 12 (0.8-40) mm for minimally invasive surgery (P=.33). The rates of pelvic nodal involvement were 5.3% (19 of 358 patients) for open surgery and 4.9% (14 of 288 patients) for minimally invasive surgery (P=.81). Median (range) follow-up time was 5.5 (0.20-16.70) years for open surgery and 3.1 years (0.02-11.10) years for minimally invasive surgery (P<.001). At 4.5 years, 17 of 358 patients (4.7%) with open surgery and 18 of 288 patients (6.2%) with minimally invasive surgery had recurrence (P=.40). The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates were 94.3% (95% confidence interval, 91.6-97.0) for open surgery and 91.5% (95% confidence interval, 87.6-95.6) for minimally invasive surgery (log-rank P=.37). Post hoc propensity score analysis of recurrence risk showed no difference between surgical approaches (P=.42). At 4.5 years, there were 6 disease-related deaths (open surgery, 3; minimally invasive surgery, 3) (log-rank P=.49). The 4.5-year overall survival rates were 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.6-99.7) for open surgery and 99.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.0-99.8) for minimally invasive surgery.  Conclusion:   The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates did not differ between open radical trachelectomy and minimally invasive radical trachelectomy.

Although microsurgery is the gold standard treatment to control the symptoms of CM, resection carries high risk in some situations, especially eloquent areas. The objective was to evaluate annual hemorrhage rates (AHRs) before and after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment of cerebral CM in different locations.  Methods:   A total of 195 patients (119 women and 76 men) with CM treated at the Gazi University Gamma Knife Center between April 2005 and June 2017 were analyzed. The mean ± SD follow-up period was 67.4 ± 31.1 months (range 12 days to 170 months). AHR before SRS, AHR after SRS, morbidity associated with radiation, seizure control rate after SRS, lesion volume, coexistence with developmental venous anomaly, and SRS treatment parameters were analyzed, with evaluation of radiological data and clinical charts performed retrospectively. The seizure control rate was assessed using the Engel outcome scale.  Results:   The AHR before SRS was 15.3%. Application of SRS to these patients significantly reduced the AHR rates to 2.6% during the first 2 years after treatment and to 1.4% thereafter. Favorable seizure control (Engel class I and II) after radiosurgery was achieved in 23 patients (88.5%) with epilepsy. Radiation-related temporary complications occurred in 15.4% of patients, and permanent morbidity occurred in 4.6%.

HGTCs are aggressive: the 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and 20-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 89%, 76%, 60%, and 35%, respectively. Although DSS was similar between HGTC-PDTC and HGTC-nonPDTC patients, HGTC-PDTC was associated with higher rate of radioactive iodine avidity, a higher frequency of RAS mutations, a lower frequency of BRAF V600E mutations and a higher propensity for distant metastasis (DM) than HGTC-nonPDTC. Independent clinicopathological markers of worse outcome were: older age, male sex, extensive necrosis and lack of encapsulation for DSS; older age, male sex and vascular invasion for DM-free survival; and older age, necrosis, positive margins and lymph node metastasis for locoregional recurrence-free survival. The frequencies of BRAF, RAS, TERT, TP53 and PTEN alterations were 28%, 40%, 55%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. TP53, PTEN and TERT were independent molecular markers associated with an unfavourable outcome, independently of clinicopathological parameters. The coexistence of BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutation increased the risk of DM.

Therapeutic plan adjustment included the addition or increased dosage of anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics.Using the cutoff value for FC of 200 μg/g, the appropriate time interval for dividing the association and non-association between Mayo endoscopic subscore and FC was 7 days (sensitivity, 74.4%; specificity, 50.0%; area under the curve [AUC], 0.6032).

However, the use of multiple modalities is inconvenient and costly. In the present retrospective study, we evaluated the correlation between regional brain uptake ratios (URs) in perfusion FP-CIT PET and ECD SPECT images.Twenty patients with Parkinson's symptoms underwent perfusion DAT positron emission tomography (18F-FP-CIT PET/CT) and cerebral blood flow tomography (99mTc-ECD SPECT) within a 2-week period.

This study aimed to observe the time of choroidal neovascularization detection after CSC diagnosis and determine whether clinical features and prognosis differed in patients with chronic CSC or age-related retinal degeneration.In this retrospective study, medical records of CSC patients complicated with CNV who visited Seoul St. Mary's hospital of Korea between October 2009 and December 2020 were reviewed. The presence of CNV was determined using fluorescein, indocyanine green, or optical coherent tomography angiography (OCTA). Based on the patients' medical records, we observed the change of clinical pattern, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) at CNV detection and at 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years following CNV detection.Thirty eyes of 30 patients (male: female ratio of 13:17) were enrolled. Mean age at diagnosis of CSC was 54.0 ± 8.5 years (mean ± standard deviation). On average, CNV was detected 1.65 ± 2.30 years after the diagnosis of CSC. The mean CMT was significantly decreased at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years after choroidal neovascularization detection (P < .001, P < .001, P = .001 respectively).

Here, we investigated the behavioral, histochemical, neuromorphological, and transcriptional changes induced by maternal separation (MS), an ELS model. Without neurotoxin, MS rats showed behavioral alterations in olfaction, locomotion, and gait characters after depression compared with control rats. Based on neuroimaging and histochemistry, although we found that the dopaminergic system in the striatum was impaired after MS, the decrease of striatal dopamine level was ~33%. Consistently, tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining positive neurons of MS rats in the substantia nigra showed deficit by about 20% in cell counting. Furthermore, using transcriptome sequencing, we discovered many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of MS rats in the striatum significantly enriched in the pathway of dopaminergic synapse, and the biological process of locomotion and neuromuscular process controlling balance. Encouragingly, some representative DEGs relating to PD were singled out.

While these events are rare, we sought to perform a retrospective analysis of these cases to ascertain the reasons that MRI-targeted biopsy missed clinically significant cancer which was subsequently detected on systematic prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Patients were enrolled in a prospective study comparing cancer detection rates by transrectal MRI-targeted fusion biopsy and systematic 12-core biopsy. Patients with an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA), abnormal digital rectal examination, or imaging findings concerning for prostate cancer underwent prostate MRI and subsequent MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy in the same setting. The subset of patients with grade group (GG) ≥3 cancer found on systematic biopsy and GG ≤2 cancer (or no cancer) on MRI-targeted biopsy was classified as MRI-targeted biopsy misses. A retrospective analysis of the MRI and MRI-targeted biopsy real-time screen captures determined the cause of MRI-targeted biopsy miss. Multivariable logistic regression analysis compared baseline characteristics of patients with MRI-targeted biopsy misses to GG-matched patients whose clinically significant cancer was detected by MRI-targeted biopsy.  Results:   Over the study period of 2007 to 2019, 2,103 patients met study inclusion criteria and underwent combined MRI-targeted and systematic prostate biopsies. A total of 41 (1.9%) men were classified as MRI-targeted biopsy misses. Most MRI-targeted biopsy misses were due to errors in lesion targeting (21, 51.2%), followed by MRI-invisible lesions (17, 40.5%) and MRI lesions missed by the radiologist (3, 7.1%). On logistic regression analysis, lower Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADSTM) score was associated with having clinically significant cancer missed on MRI-targeted biopsy.  Conclusions:   While uncommon, most MRI-targeted biopsy misses are due to errors in lesion targeting, which highlights the importance of accurate co-registration and targeting when using software-based fusion platforms. Additionally, some patients will harbor MRI-invisible lesions which are untargetable by MRI-targeted platforms. The presence of a low PI-RADS score despite a high PSA is suggestive of harboring an MRI-invisible lesion.""","""['Cheyenne Williams', 'Michael Ahdoot', 'Michael A Daneshvar', 'Christian Hague', 'Andrew R Wilbur', 'Patrick T Gomella', 'Joanna Shih', 'Nabila Khondakar', 'Nitin Yerram', 'Sherif Mehralivand', 'Sandeep Gurram', 'Minhaj Siddiqui', 'Paul Pinsky', 'Howard Parnes', 'Maria Merino', 'Bradford Wood', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[' Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ' Biometric Research Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ' Molecular Imaging Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ' Director of Urologic Oncology and Robotic Surgery, VA Medical Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland.', ' Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ' Translational Surgical Pathology Section, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ' Center for Interventional Oncology, National Cancer Institute, & Interventional Radiology, Radiology and Imaging Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI-ultrasonography software fusion prostate biopsy: initial results using a stereotactic robotic-assisted transperineal prostate biopsy platform comparing systematic vs targeted biopsy.', 'Using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Scores to Select an Optimal Prostate Biopsy Method: A Secondary Analysis of the Trio Study.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Improving the understanding of PI-RADS in practice: characters of PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions with negative biopsy.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Assessing the Role of High-resolution Microultrasound Among Naïve Patients with Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Persistently High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Towards a judicious use of perilesional biopsy in the era of MRI-targeting, parting of the ways from systematic prostate biopsy.', 'The Potential and Emerging Role of Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Cancer Characterization.']"""

It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). The most commonly reported adverse event in the phase III licensing trial was drug eruption (28%), now termed mogamulizumab-associated rash (MAR). Clinical recommendations about MAR and its treatment differ between the current package insert and postapproval insights reported from two single-centre studies that focused on its characterization, but less so on outcomes and clinicopathological differentiation from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).  Objectives:   To describe our experience in the diagnosis of MAR and treatment of patients with CTCL with mogamulizumab.  Methods:   This is a single-centre retrospective case series study.  Results:   We found a higher incidence of MAR in patients with CTCL (17 of 24, 68%) than previously reported. MAR development is associated with complete (11 of 17) or partial (four of 17) responses, with an overall response rate of 88%, compared with 29% (two of seven) in patients without MAR. Diagnosis of MAR may be obscured by its ability to mimic key CTCL features both clinically and histologically, but an absence of T-cell-receptor clonality and relatively decreased CD4 : CD8 ratio compared with baseline lesions strongly favour MAR over recurrent disease.  Conclusions:   MAR has the potential to create a significant management problem for patients on mogamulizumab.

We aimed to identify whether any CHSs have a favored microenvironment for immunotherapy via multidimensional evaluation of the immunologic characteristics of this tumor.  Experimental design:   We obtained 98 newly-diagnosed CHS fresh tumors from several institutions and performed comprehensive analysis of data from CyTOF, whole-exome sequencing, and flow cytometry in 22 cases. Clinical data from immunotherapy responders and nonresponders were compared to explore possible biomarkers of immunotherapy response. Mechanism studies were conducted to interpret the biomarker phenotype.  Results:   Based on the integrated data of single-cell CyTOF and flow cytometry, the CHS immune-microenvironment phenotypes were classified into three groups: subtype I, the ""granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cell (G-MDSC) dominant"" cluster, with high number of HLA-DR- CD14- myeloid cells; subtype II, the ""immune exhausted"" cluster, with high exhausted T-cell and dendritic-cell infiltration; and subtype III, the ""immune desert"" cluster, with few immune cells. Immune cell-rich subtypes (subtype I and II) were characterized by IDH mutation, pathologic high grade, and peritumoral edema, while subtype I cases were exclusively featured by myxoid transformation. In clinical practice involving 12 individuals who received PD-1 antibody immunotherapy, all of the 3 cases with controlled diseases were retrospectively classified as subtype II. In mechanism, IDH mutation significantly elevated chemokine levels and immune-cell infiltration in immune-inactivated tumors.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to provide immune characterization of CHS, representing a major step to precise immunotherapy against this malignancy.

Background:   Aortic 4-dimensional flow cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can quantify regions exposed to high WSS, a known stimulus for arterial wall dysfunction. However, its association with longitudinal changes in aortic dilation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is unknown.  Methods:   This retrospective study identified 72 patients with BAV (age 45 ± 12 years) who underwent CMR for surveillance of aortic dilation at baseline and ≥5 years of follow-up. Four-dimensional flow CMR analysis included the calculation of WSS heat maps to compare regional WSS in individual patients with population averages of healthy age- and sex-matched subjects (database of 136 controls). The relative areas of the AAo and aorta (in %) exposed to elevated WSS (outside the 95% CI of healthy population averages) were quantified.  Results:   At a median follow-up duration of 6.0 years, the mean AAo growth rate was 0.24 ± 0.20 mm/y. The fraction of the AAo exposed to elevated WSS at baseline was increased for patients with higher growth rates (>0.24 mm/y, n = 32) compared with those with growth rates <0.24 mm/y (19.9% [IQR: 10.2%-25.5%] vs 5.7% [IQR: 1.5%-21.3%]; P = 0.008). Larger areas of elevated WSS in the AAo and entire aorta were associated with higher rates of AAo dilation >0.24 mm/y (odds ratio: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.05-2.17; P = 0.026 and odds ratio: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.01-3.15; P = 0.046, respectively).

To achieve a consensus as the rate of spontaneous improvement of flatfoot, the present study aimed to estimate the rate of spontaneous improvement of flatfoot and to analyze correlating factors.We reviewed the records of patients examined between May 2013 and May 2019 so as to identify those factors associated with idiopathic flatfoot below 12 years of age. We included patients with who had been followed for >6 months, and those for whom ≥2 (anteroposterior and lateral) weight-bearing bilateral radiographs of the foot had been obtained. The progression rates of the anteroposterior (AP) talo-first metatarsal angle, talonavicular coverage angle, lateral talo-first metatarsal angle, and calcaneal pitch angle were adjusted by multiple factors using a linear mixed model, with sex, body mass index, and Achilles tendon contracture as the fixed effects and age and each subject as the random effects.We found that 4 of the radiographic measurements improved as patients grew older. The AP talo-first metatarsal angle, talonavicular coverage angle, and the lateral talo-first metatarsal angle decreased, while the calcaneal pitch angle increased. The AP talo-first metatarsal angle (P < .001), talonavicular coverage angle (P < .001), and lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (P < .001) improved significantly; however, the calcaneal pitch angle (P = .367) did not show any significant difference. In general, the flatfeet showed an improving trend; after analyzing the factors, no sex difference was observed (P = .117), while body mass index (P < .001) and Achilles tendon contracture (P < .001) showed a negative correlation.The study demonstrated that children's flatfeet spontaneously improved at the age of 12 years. It would be more beneficial if the clinician shows the predicted appearance of the foot at the completion of growth by calculating the radiographic indices and identifying the correlating factors in addition to explaining that flatfoot may gradually improve.

Methods:   Patients with phalanx fractures from January 2015 to January 2018 who were admitted to our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients received surgery with traditional manual or temporary locking of the interphalangeal joint reduction. The information of patients, including age, gender, the length of the operation, the fracture healed time, the postoperative function recovery, complication, and length of postoperative hospital stay, was collected. All of the information were evaluated and compared between the 2 groups. All of the surgery were performed by 2 experienced hand surgeons of our department.

Perioperative evaluation indicators included operation time, the intraoperative blood loss, length of incision and hospitalization time. Clinical outcomes were measured preoperatively, and at 1 days, 3 months, and 12 months postoperatively. The patients' lower limb pain was evaluated using Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. The ODI is the most widely-used assessment method internationally for lumbar or leg pain at present. Every category comprises 6 options, with the highest score for each question being 5 points. higher scores represent more serious dysfunction. The VAS is the most commonly-used quantitative method for assessing the degree of pain in clinical practice. The measurement method is to draw a 10 cm horizontal line on a piece of paper, 1 end of which is 0, indicating no pain, which the other end is 10, which means severe pain, and the middle part indicates different degree of pain.Compared with the TL group, the operation time, postoperative bed-rest time, and hospitalization time of the PTED group were significantly shorter, and the intraoperative blood loss was also reduced. These differences were statistically significant (P < .01). There were no significant differences in VAS or ODI scores between the two groups before or after surgery (P > .05).PTED and TL have similar clinical efficacy in the treatment of RLDH, but PTED can shorten the operation time, postoperative bed-rest time and hospitalization time, and reduce intraoperative blood loss, so the PTED is a safe and effective surgical method for the treatment of RLDH than TL, but more randomized controlled trials are still required to further verify these conclusions.""","""['Shifeng Jiang', 'Qingning Li', 'Hongzhi Wang']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedics, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Shushan lake road No.350, shushan district, hefei city, Anhui Province, china.', ' Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, 678 Furong Road, Hefei, Anhui, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Clinical efficacy of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy in treating adolescent lumbar disc herniation.', 'Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy compared with microendoscopic discectomy for lumbar disc herniation: 1-year results of an ongoing randomized controlled trial.', 'Microendoscopic Discectomy Combined with Annular Suture Versus Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation: A Prospective Observational Study.', 'Comparison of Three Common Intervertebral Disc Discectomies in the Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Based on Multiple Data.', 'Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for recurrent lumbar disc herniation.', 'Clinical efficacy of transforaminal endoscopic discectomy in the treatment of recurrent lumbar disc herniation: a single-center retrospective analysis.', 'Short-Term Postoperative Pain and Function of Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Discectomy versus Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy for Single-Segment Lumbar Disc Herniation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Both ectopic lesions are speculated to originate from uterine eutopic endometrium, which is composed of epithelium and stroma, but how these two different tissue types co-evolve in ectopic locations remains unclear. Here, we analyzed exome-wide mutations and global methylation in microdissected epithelium and stroma separately in paired adenomyosis, peritoneal endometriosis, and endometrium to investigate their relationship. Analyses of somatic mutations and their allele frequencies indicate monoclonal development not only in epithelium but also in the stroma of adenomyosis and peritoneal endometriosis. Our preliminary phylogenetic study suggests a plausible clonal derivation in epithelium and stroma of both ectopic and eutopic endometrium from the same founder epithelium-stroma progenitor cells. While a patient-specific methylation landscape is evident, adenomyosis epithelium and stroma can be distinguished from normal-appearing eutopic endometrium epigenetically. In summary, endometrial stroma, like its epithelial counterpart, could be clonal and both ectopic and eutopic endometrium following divergent evolutionary trajectories. Our data also warrant future investigations into the role of endometrial stroma in the pathobiology of endometrium-related disorders. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Here we identify national treatment patterns and survival outcomes in women with stage I-III invasive breast cancer.  Patients and methods:   Women age ≥80 diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer (IBC) were identified from 2005-2014 in the National Cancer Database. χ2, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression models were used to identify factors influencing receipt of breast surgery, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate overall survival (OS).  Results:   A total of 62,575 women with IBC met inclusion criteria, of which the majority received surgery (94%). Receipt of surgery was associated with White race, age <90, lower stage, and fewer comorbidities. OS was higher for those who received surgery compared to those who did not (HR 3.3 [3.18-3.46] P < .001). Molecular subtype analysis demonstrated improved survival with receipt of surgery or radiation for all subtypes, as well as improved survival with chemotherapy for those with triple negative breast cancer.  Conclusion:   The vast majority of breast cancer patients aged ≥80 in the National Cancer Database with IBC received primary surgical management, which was associated with a significant OS benefit.

We propose using a dimensionality reduction method to retrospectively estimate the respiratory phase of DW images and facilitate both distortion correction (DisCo) and motion compensation.  Methods:   Free-breathing electrocardiogram-triggered whole left-ventricular cardiac DTI using a second-order motion-compensated spin echo EPI sequence and alternating directionality of phase encoding blips was performed on 11 healthy volunteers. The respiratory phase of each DW image was estimated after projecting the DW images into a 2D space with Laplacian eigenmaps. DisCo and motion compensation were applied to the respiratory sorted DW images. The results were compared against conventional breath-held T2 half-Fourier single shot turbo spin echo. Cardiac DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and helix angle transmurality were compared with and without DisCo.  Results:   The left-ventricular geometries after DisCo and motion compensation resulted in significantly improved alignment of DW images with T2 reference. DisCo reduced the distance between the left-ventricular contours by 13.2% ± 19.2%, P < .05 (2.0 ± 0.4 for DisCo and 2.4 ± 0.5 mm for uncorrected). DisCo DTI parameter maps yielded no significant differences (mean diffusivity: 1.55 ± 0.13 × 10-3 mm2 /s and 1.53 ± 0.13 × 10-3 mm2 /s, P = .09; fractional anisotropy: 0.375 ± 0.041 and 0.379 ± 0.045, P = .11; helix angle transmurality: 1.00% ± 0.10°/% and 0.99% ± 0.12°/%, P = .44), although the orientation of individual tensors differed.

Here, we examined whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was useful for detecting FGFR2 amplification and co-occurring resistance mechanisms in advanced gastric cancer.  Experimental design:   We assessed genomic characteristics of FGFR2-amplified advanced gastric cancer in a nationwide ctDNA screening study. We also analyzed FGFR2 amplification status in paired tissue and plasma samples with advanced gastric cancer. In addition, we examined patients with FGFR2-amplified advanced gastric cancer identified by ctDNA sequencing who received FGFR inhibitors.  Results: FGFR2 amplification was more frequently detected by ctDNA sequencing in 28 (7.7%) of 365 patients with advanced gastric cancer than by tissue analysis alone (2.6%-4.4%). FGFR2 amplification profiling of paired tissue and plasma revealed that FGFR2 amplification was detectable only by ctDNA sequencing in 6 of 44 patients, which was associated with a worse prognosis. Two patients in whom FGFR2 amplification was detected by ctDNA sequencing after tumor progression following previous standard chemotherapies but not by pretreatment tissue analysis had tumor responses to FGFR inhibitors. A third patient with FGFR2 and MET co-amplification in ctDNA showed a limitation of benefit from FGFR inhibition, accompanied by a marked increase in the MET copy number.  Conclusions:   ctDNA sequencing identifies FGFR2 amplification missed by tissue testing in patients with advanced gastric cancer, and these patients may respond to FGFR inhibition.

We hypothesized that in such women with obesity, weight loss during progestin treatment may improve oncological outcomes. We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of women with obesity and atypical hyperplasia or low-grade stage 1a endometrial cancer undergoing progestin treatment. Women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2 were offered bariatric surgery; those who declined and those with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 were encouraged to lose weight by low-calorie diet. We assessed uptake of bariatric surgery; weight lost during progestin treatment; and the impact of more than 10% total body weight loss on progestin treatment response at 12 months. 71 women [median age 58 years (interquartile range; IQR 35-65); mean BMI 48 kg/m2 (SD 9.3)] completed the study. Twenty-three women (32%) had bariatric surgery, on average 5 months (IQR 3-8) after progestin treatment commenced. Weight change during progestin treatment was -33.4 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) -42.1, -24.7] and -4.6 kg (95% CI -7.8, -1.4) in women receiving bariatric surgery and low-calorie diet, respectively (P < 0.001). Forty-three women (61%) responded to progestin, while 23 (32%) showed stabilized and 5 (7%) progressive disease. Response at 12 months was not predicted by age or baseline BMI, but women who lost more than 10% of their total body weight were more likely to respond to progestin than those who did not (adjusted odds ratio 3.95; 95% CI 1.3, 12.5; P = 0.02). Thus weight loss may improve oncological outcomes in women with obesity-associated endometrial neoplastic abnormalities treated with progestin. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: This study found that weight loss improves response rates in women with obesity and atypical hyperplasia or low-risk endometrial cancer undergoing conservative management with intrauterine progestin. Given the additional benefits of weight loss for fertility, cardiovascular health and quality of life, future research should focus on how best to accomplish it.""","""['Chloe E Barr', 'Neil A J Ryan', 'A E Derbyshire', 'Y Louise Wan', 'Michelle L MacKintosh', 'Rhona J McVey', 'James Bolton', 'Cheryl Fitzgerald', 'Dina Awad', 'Richard J Slade', 'Akheel A Syed', 'Basil J Ammori', 'Emma J Crosbie']""","""[' Gynaecological Oncology Research Group, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', "" Department of Gynaecology, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom."", ' Department of Histopathology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Radiology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Gynaecological Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ' Department of Obesity Medicine, Diabetes & Endocrinology, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Salford, United Kingdom.', ' Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Gastroenterology, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine & Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ' Gynaecological Oncology Research Group, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom. emma.crosbie@manchester.ac.uk.']""","""2021""","""2021 Nov""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['National patterns of care and fertility outcomes for reproductive-aged women with endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia.', 'Progestin therapy for obese women with complex atypical hyperplasia: levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device vs systemic therapy.', 'Hysteroscopic Resection in Fertility-Sparing Surgery for Atypical Hyperplasia and Endometrial Cancer: Safety and Efficacy.', 'Conservative Management of Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia and Early Endometrial Cancer in Childbearing Age Women.', 'Efficacy of oral or intrauterine device-delivered progestin in patients with complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia or early endometrial adenocarcinoma: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature.', 'ESGO/ESHRE/ESGE Guidelines for the fertility-sparing treatment of patients with endometrial carcinoma.', 'Endometrial Cancer in Reproductive Age: Fertility-Sparing Approach and Reproductive Outcomes.', 'Improving the Diagnosis of Endometrial Hyperplasia Using Computerized Analysis and Immunohistochemical Biomarkers.', 'Identifying molecular mediators of the relationship between body mass index and endometrial cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization analysis.', ""Women's Risk Perceptions and Willingness to Engage in Risk-Reducing Interventions for the Prevention of Obesity-Related Endometrial Cancer.""]"""

Methods and results:   We retrospectively measured computed tomography-derived PAT volumes in 77 consecutive adults who had available chest CT imaging prior to HeartMate 3 LVAD surgery between October 2015 and March 2019 at Duke University Hospital. Study groups were divided into above-median (≥219 cm3) and below-median (<219 cm3) PAT volume. Those with above-median PAT had a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Groups with above-median vs below-median PAT had similar Kaplan-Meier incidence rates over 2 years for (1) composite all-cause mortality, redo-LVAD surgery and cardiac transplantation (35.9 vs 32.2%; log-rank P = 0.65) and (2) composite incident hospitalizations for HF, gastrointestinal bleeding, LVAD-related infection, and stroke (61.5 vs 60.5%; log-rank P = 0.67).  Conclusions:   In patients with end-stage HF undergoing LVAD therapy, PAT is not associated with worse 2-year LVAD-related outcomes. The significance of regional adiposity vs obesity in LVAD patients warrants further investigation.""","""['Vishal N Rao', 'Mary Jo Obeid', 'Francesca Rigiroli', 'Stuart D Russell', 'Chetan B Patel', 'Jeroen Molinger', 'Rajan T Gupta', 'Richa Agarwal', 'Marat Fudim']""","""[' Division of Cardiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) ultrasound lexicon descriptors and sTILs in TNBC.  Materials and methods:   Patients with stage I-III TNBC were evaluated within a single-institution neoadjuvant clinical trial. Two fellowship-trained breast radiologists used the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon to assess pretreatment tumor shape, margin, echo pattern, orientation, posterior features, and vascularity. sTILs were defined as low <20 or high ≥20 on the pretreatment biopsy. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the association between lexicon descriptors and sTIL levels.  Results:   The 284 patients (mean age 52 years, range 24-79 years) were comprised of 68% (193/284) with low-sTIL tumors and 32% (91/284) with high-sTIL tumors. TNBC tumors with high sTILs were more likely to have the following features: (1) oval/round shape than irregular shape (p = 0.003), (2) circumscribed or microlobulated margins than spiculated, indistinct, or angular margins (p = 0.0005); (3) complex cystic and solid pattern than heterogeneous pattern (p = 0.006); and (4) posterior enhancement than shadowing (p = 0.002). There was no significant association between sTILs and descriptors for orientation and vascularity (p = 0.06 and p = 0.49, respectively).  Conclusion:   BI-RADS ultrasound descriptors of the pretreatment appearance of a TNBC tumor can be useful in discriminating between tumors with low and high sTIL levels. Therefore, there is a potential use of ultrasound tumor characteristics to complement sTILs when used as stratification factors in treatment algorithms for TNBC.""","""['Rosalind P Candelaria', 'David A Spak', 'Gaiane M Rauch', 'Lei Huo', 'Roland L Bassett', 'Lumarie Santiago', 'Marion E Scoggins', 'Mary S Guirguis', 'Miral M Patel', 'Gary J Whitman', 'Stacy L Moulder', 'Alastair M Thompson', 'Elizabeth E Ravenberg', 'Jason B White', 'Nour K Abuhadra', 'Vicente Valero', 'Jennifer Litton', 'Beatriz E Adrada', 'Wei T Yang']""","""[' Department of Breast Imaging, Unit 1350, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

To resolve the abrupt overloading of COVID-19-suspected patients in a community, each ED needs to respond in various ways. In our hospital, we increased the isolation beds through temporary remodeling and by performing in-hospital COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing rather than outsourcing them. The aim of this study was to verify the effects of our response to the newly developed viral outbreak.The medical records of patients who presented to an ED were analyzed retrospectively. We divided the study period into 3: pre-COVID-19, transition period of response (the period before fully implementing the response measures), and post-response (the period after complete response). We compared the parameters of the National Emergency Department Information System and information about isolation and COVID-19.The number of daily ED patients was 86.8 ± 15.4 in the pre-COVID-19, 36.3 ± 13.6 in the transition period, and 67.2 ± 10.0 in the post-response period (P < .001).

However, efficient indicators for disease severity have not been fully investigated. Here, we aim to investigate whether dynamic changes of lymphocyte counts can predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19.We collected data from 2923 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Patients were then screened, and we focused on 145 severe cases and 60 critical cases (29 recovered cases, 31 deaths). The length of hospitalization was divided into five time points, namely admission, 25%, 50%, 75% and discharge or death, according to the principle of interquartile distance. A series of laboratory findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed during hospitalization. The results showed that there were differences in levels of leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes at almost every time point in the severe cases and 60 critical cases (29 recovered cases, 31 deaths). Further analysis showed that 70.2% of the COVID-19 cases had low circulating lymphocyte count, of which 64.1% were severe cases and 85.0% were critical cases (75.9% recovered cases and 93.5% died). Moreover, the lymphocyte count in dead cases was significantly lower than that of critical cases who recovered, at almost every time point in the critical groups. We also divided critical patients into group A (<1.1 × 109/L) and group B (>1.1 × 109/L) according to number of lymphocytes. Through survival analysis, we found that there was no significant difference in survival between group A and group B at admission (P = .3065). However, the survival rate according to lymphocyte levels in group A was significantly lower than that of group B at 25% hospital stay (on average day 6.5), 50% and 75% time points (P < .001).Lymphocyte counts that remain lower after the first week following symptom onset are highly predictive of in-hospital death of adults with COVID-19.

Trigger factors are poorly understood but may be linked to sudden worsening in supply-demand mismatch in compromised tissue. Sustained or transient elevations in intracranial pressure are also prevalent in the injured brain. Here, using a mouse model of large hemispheric ischaemic stroke, we show that mild and brief intracranial pressure elevations (20 or 30 mmHg for just 3 min) potently trigger spreading depolarizations in ischaemic penumbra (4-fold increase in spreading depolarization occurrence). We also show that 30 mmHg intracranial pressure spikes as brief as 30 s are equally effective. In contrast, sustained intracranial pressure elevations to the same level for 30 min do not significantly increase the spreading depolarization rate, suggesting that an abrupt disturbance in the steady state equilibrium is required to trigger a spreading depolarization. Laser speckle flowmetry consistently showed a reduction in tissue perfusion, and two-photon pO2 microscopy revealed a drop in venous pO2 during the intracranial pressure spikes suggesting increased oxygen extraction fraction, and therefore, worsening supply-demand mismatch. These haemodynamic changes during intracranial pressure spikes were associated with highly reproducible increases in extracellular potassium levels in penumbra. Consistent with the experimental data, a higher rate of intracranial pressure spikes was associated with spreading depolarization clusters in a retrospective series of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with strong temporal correspondence. Altogether, our data show that intracranial pressure spikes, even when mild and brief, are capable of triggering spreading depolarizations. Aggressive prevention of intracranial pressure spikes may help reduce spreading depolarization occurrence and improve outcomes after brain injury.""","""['Fumiaki Oka', 'Homa Sadeghian', 'Mohammad A Yaseen', 'Buyin Fu', 'Sreekanth Kura', 'Tao Qin', 'Sava Sakadžić', 'Kazutaka Sugimoto', 'Takao Inoue', 'Hideyuki Ishihara', 'Sadahiro Nomura', 'Michiyasu Suzuki', 'Cenk Ayata']""","""[' Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.', ' Department of Neurosurgery, Yamaguchi Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, 755-8505, Japan.', ' Optics Division, MGH/MIT/HMS Athinoula A Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.', ' Department of Advanced ThermoNeuroBiology, Yamaguchi Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, 755-8505, Japan.', ' Stroke Service, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']""","""2022""","""2022 Mar""","""Brain""","""['Requisite ischemia for spreading depolarization occurrence after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rodents.', 'Dibucaine mitigates spreading depolarization in human neocortical slices and prevents acute dendritic injury in the ischemic rodent neocortex.', 'The negative ultraslow potential, electrophysiological correlate of infarction in the human cortex.', 'Recording, analysis, and interpretation of spreading depolarizations in neurointensive care: Review and recommendations of the COSBID research group.', 'Impaired neurovascular coupling to ictal epileptic activity and spreading depolarization in a patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage: possible link to blood-brain barrier dysfunction.', 'Optogenetic Spreading Depolarizations Do Not Worsen Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcome.', 'Cerebral Microcirculation, Perivascular Unit, and Glymphatic System: Role of Aquaporin-4 as the Gatekeeper for Water Homeostasis.']"""

This study aims to measure the impact of supervision by subspecialized radiologists on diagnostic accuracy of NI-RADS when initial reading is performed by residents.  Methods:   150 CT and MRI datasets were initially read by two trained residents, and then supervised by two subspecialized radiologists. Recurrence rates by NI-RADS category were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. After dichotomization of the NI-RADS system (category 1 vs categories 2 + 3+4 and categories 1 + 2 vs 3 + 4), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were calculated.  Results:   26% of the reports were modified by the supervising radiologists. Area under the curve of ROC plots values of the supervision session were higher than those of the initial reading session for both the primary site (0.89 vs 0.86) and the neck (0.94 vs 0.91), but the difference was not statistically significant. For dichotomized NI-RADS category assignments, differences between the initial reading and the supervision session were statistically significant regarding specificity and PPV for the primary site (1 + 2 vs 3 + 4 and 1 vs 2 + 3+4) or even for both sites combined (1 vs 2 + 3+4).

This study aimed to evaluate the value of PCT and PLT in determining the severity of urinary sepsis.  Methods:   A total of 120 urosepsis patients enrolled were divided into a survival group and a death group, respectively, according to their status within 14 days after admission. Changes in PCT and PLT levels between the 2 groups were compared at different time points. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was eventually obtained to predict the prognostic value of PCT and PLT.  Results:   The PCT levels in the survival group declined gradually after admission, and the PLT decreased at first but increased rapidly in subsequence. The PCT level in the death group, however, declined in a flat-slope trend or was hardly noticeable together with the number of PLT reduced significantly. In particular, it is on the 3rd day that PCT tended to positively correlate with acute physiological and chronic health score II (APACHE II) score (r = 0.730, P < .05), but negatively with PLT (r = 0.472, P < .05). The APACHE II score and PLT (r = 0.612, P < .05) were also negatively correlated with each other. As indicated by the ROC curve, the PCT level on the 3rd day after admission was of great value for the clinical mortality prognosis, and the area under the curve was 0.858. Moreover, PLT also has a high predictive value for prognosis. Area under the curve is 0.951. When the PLT was more than 51 × 109 /L, the sensitivity was up to 90%, and the specificity was 90%.  Conclusion:   PLT and PCT levels are closely related to the APACHE II score, which could indicate the severity of urosepsis in patients.

Ultrasound-guided ISB enables visualization of the local anesthetic spread and a reduction in local anesthetic volume. However, little is known about the appropriate local anesthetic dose for surgical anesthesia without sedation or general anesthesia. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the appropriate local anesthetic volume by comparing intraoperative analgesics and hemodynamic changes in ISB in arthroscopic shoulder surgery.Overall, 1007 patients were divided into groups 1, 2, and 3 according to the following volume of local anesthetics: 10-19, 20-29, and 30-40 mL, respectively. The use of intraoperative analgesics and sedatives, and the reduction in intraoperative maximum blood pressure and heart rate were compared through retrospective analysis.Fentanyl was used in 55.6% of patients in group 1, which was significantly higher than in those groups 2 and 3 (22.3% and 30.7%, respectively); furthermore, it was also higher than those in groups 2 and 3 in dose-specific comparisons (P < .05). The percent of the maximum reduction in intraoperative systolic blood pressure and heart rate in group 3 was significantly higher than those in groups 1 and 2. Ephedrine administration was lower in group 2 than that in other groups (P < .05). The incidence of hypotensive bradycardic events was lowest (9.1%) at the local anesthetic volume of 24 mL as revealed by the quadratic regression analysis (R2 = 0.313, P = .003).Decreasing the local anesthetic volume to less than 20 mL for ultrasound-guided ISB as the sole anesthesia increases the opioid consumption during shoulder arthroscopic surgery. Local anesthetics >30 mL or increased opioid consumption with <20 mL of local anesthetics could increase the risk of cardiovascular instability intraoperatively. Our findings indicate that 24 mL of local anesthetic could be used to lower the incidence of hypotensive bradycardic events.""","""['Jung A Lim', 'Hyungseop Lim', 'Ji Hyeon Lee', 'Sang Gyu Kwak', 'Jong Hae Kim', 'Seok Young Song', 'Woon Seok Roh']""","""[' Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, School of Medicine, Daegu Catholic University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', ' Department of Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, Daegu Catholic University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jul""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['A randomized comparison between interscalene and combined infraclavicular-suprascapular blocks for arthroscopic shoulder surgery.', 'Comparison of interscalene brachial plexus block and intra-articular local anesthetic administration on postoperative pain management in arthroscopic shoulder surgery.', 'Comparison of ultrasound-guided and nerve stimulator-guided interscalene blocks as a sole anesthesia in shoulder arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: A retrospective study.', 'Will the Real Benefits of Single-Shot Interscalene Block Please Stand Up?

We sought to evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on IDRFs and associated ability to achieve gross total resection (GTR) of locoregional disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients treated on four consecutive high-risk neuroblastoma protocols over a 20-year period at a single institution. The number of IDRFs at diagnosis and just prior to surgery, and the percent decrease of tumor volume from just prior to surgery to the end of induction were determined.  Results:   Eighty-eight patients were included. There were 438 IDRFs (average 5.0 ± 3.1 per patient) at diagnosis and 198 (average 2.3 ± 1.9 per patient) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.01). A reduction in IDRFs was seen in 81.8% of patients with average decrease of 2.9 ± 2.5 per patient. The average percent reduction in tumor volume was 89.8 ± 18.9% and correlated with the number of IDRFs present after chemotherapy (p < 0.01).

Methods:   in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days.  Results:   cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable.

A fixed hinged knee prosthesis has been designed to preserve the growth plates in the adjacent tibia, expecting tibial growth to be continued. This study aims to report the (1) clinical outcomes after prosthetic replacement, (2) postoperative complications, and (3) length of discrepancy of the operative tibia with the unaffected tibia. Thirty-four skeletally immature patients (averaged 9 years at surgery; range, 5-12 years) with distal femoral osteosarcoma underwent placement of this hinged knee prosthesis between January 2015 and August 2018. Postoperative function and complications were assessed. Length discrepancy was measured using a series of full-length standing anteroposterior radiographs of the bilateral lower extremity. The average follow-up duration was 34 months (2.8 years). In the last follow-up, four patients expired because of pulmonary metastasis. Two patients presented with local recurrence of the soft tissue. Postoperatively, the flexion range of the knee joint range was between 100 and 130 degrees, with an average of 115.2 degrees. The mean functional score of living patients evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system was 89.2% (range, 76.7-100%). Types 1 (three patients), 2 (one patient), 3 (two patients), and 5 (two patients) complications exist. Among them, three patients received revision surgery. The proximal tibial physis still grew after surgery, with an average of 74.3% (range, 30-100%) growth potential compared with the unaffected proximal tibial physis. Moreover, 27 children exhibited tibial length discrepancy compared with the contralateral tibia, and the mean discrepancy in tibial length was 1.1 cm (range, 0.2-3.1 cm). This hinged knee prosthesis can keep the growth potential in the adjacent tibia, provides satisfying functional outcomes, and has a lower postoperative complication rate.

Patients and methods:   Eligible patients (N = 513) were randomized 2:1 to veliparib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel or placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel; patients had variable platinum-free intervals (PFI) at progression. In the placebo arm, patients were eligible to receive crossover veliparib monotherapy (300-400 mg twice daily continuous). Antitumor activity and adverse events were assessed during crossover veliparib treatment. BRCA reversion mutations at crossover were analyzed retrospectively using next-generation sequencing on plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).  Results:   Seventy-five patients in the placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel arm received ≥1 dose of crossover veliparib postprogression (mean treatment duration: 154 days). Eight of 50 (16%) patients with measurable disease had a RECIST v1.1 response.

Study design:   Retrospective case series.  Methods:   A clinical series of six patients undergoing NSF reconstruction of lateral TORS oropharyngectomy defects was retrospectively studied. All patients underwent TORS for the treatment of intermediate-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma of the lateral pharyngeal wall between January and June 2017. All patients underwent NSF reconstruction of lateral TORS defects with retrospective analysis of outcomes and complications.  Results:   Six patients underwent NSF reconstruction of lateral TORS defects. Operative times decreased from 180 minutes to 90 minutes over the study period. There were two cases of partial flap dehiscence and partial necrosis. There were no major donor site complications. All patients had temporary nasal obstruction and crusting. Two experienced temporary aural fullness. In all patients, the lateral wall was mucosalized in 1-3 weeks. Cephalometric analysis of preoperative imaging revealed that patients with high-arched palates (>3 cm) and defect lengths that are longer than NSF flap lengths are poor candidates for this technique.  Conclusions:   This NSF is a vascularized, locoregional rotational flap that can reconstruct lateral TORS defects in salvages cases or those where the parapharyngeal carotid or mandibular bone are exposed. Postoperative morbidity is limited to temporary nasal dyspnea, aural fullness, and crusting. Preoperative imaging can determine which patient will have successful defect coverage.

Accuracy was determined by comparison with subsequent analyses of nephrectomy specimens. Statistical analyses were performed to assess biopsy accuracy and correlation with tumor size and pathologic stage.  Results.—:   From 805 biopsies with a diagnosis of renal neoplasm, 178 had subsequent resection of the biopsied tumor. Concordance rate for histologic subtype was 96.9% (κ [w], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99) and excellent for small renal masses (98.8%; κ [w], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1). Amongst the prognostic variables evaluated, BAP1 immunohistochemistry in clear cell renal cell carcinoma had the highest agreement (94.8%; κ [w], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99). The presence of 1 or more aggressive features (grade 3-4, tumor necrosis, BAP1 loss, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid change) in a biopsy significantly correlated with pT stage (P = .004).  Conclusions.—:   Biopsy analyses showed high accuracy for subtyping renal tumors, but it underestimated several poor prognostic features. Addition of BAP1 for clear cell renal cell carcinoma may increase prognostic accuracy. If validated, routine incorporation of BAP1 immunohistochemistry in clear cell renal cell carcinoma biopsies may refine prognosis and aid in the selection of patients for active surveillance.""","""['Payal Kapur', 'Sasan Setoodeh', 'Ellen Araj', 'Jingsheng Yan', 'Venkat S Malladi', 'Jeffrey A Cadeddu', 'Alana Christie', 'James Brugarolas']""","""[' From the Departments of Pathology (Kapur, Setoodeh, Araj).', ' Urology (Kapur, Cadeddu).', ' Kidney Cancer Program (Kapur, Malladi, Cadeddu, Christie, Brugarolas).', ' Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics (Malladi).', ' Population and Data Sciences (Yan).', ' Hematology-Oncology Division in Internal Medicine (Brugarolas).']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Urological Oncology: Adrenal, Renal, Ureteral and Retroperitoneal Tumors.', 'Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'BAP1 immunohistochemistry predicts outcomes in a multi-institutional cohort with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Loss of nuclear BAP1 protein expression is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Expression Of Bap1 In Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Prognostic role of BAP1 in pT1 clear cell carcinoma in partial nephrectomy specimens.', 'The expanding role of BAP1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal neoplasms which cause life-threatening tumors occurring throughout the body. Therefore, potential molecular detection and prognostic evaluation is very important for early diagnosis and treatment.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective study analyzing DNA methylation of 261 patients with sarcoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify a signature associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with sarcoma, which was validated in a validation dataset.  Results:   Three DNA methylation signatures were identified to be significantly associated with OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 3-DNA methylation signature could significantly distinguish the high- and low-risk patients in both training (first two-thirds) and validation datasets (remaining one-third). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis confirmed that the 3-DNA methylation signature exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in predicting OS of patients. Also, the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the area under curve (AUC) values indicated that the 3-DNA methylation signature was independent of clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, sex, anatomic location, tumor residual classification, and histological subtypes.  Conclusions:   The current study showed that the 3-DNA methylation model could efficiently function as a novel and independent prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with sarcoma.""","""['Xiao-Wei Wang', 'Qi Sun', 'Shi-Bin Xu', 'Chao Xu', 'Chen-Jie Xia', 'Qi-Ming Zhao', 'Hua-Hui Zhang', 'Wei-Qiang Tan', 'Lei Zhang', 'Shu-Dong Yao']""","""[' Department of Plastic Surgery, Zhejiang Hospital.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Fuyang Orthopedics and Traumatology Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University.', "" Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Xiaoshan District."", ' Department of Oncology, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Li Hui-Li Hospital, Ningbo.', ' Department of Plastic Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine.', ' Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Xiaoshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou.', ' Department of Nephrology, Huzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'A five-DNA methylation signature act as a novel prognostic biomarker in patients with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma.', 'Development and validation of an immune gene-set based prognostic signature for soft tissue sarcoma.', 'Identification of a methylomics-associated nomogram for predicting overall survival of stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma.', 'A 5-gene DNA methylation signature is a promising prognostic biomarker for early-stage cervical cancer.', 'Pyroptosis-Related Gene Signature Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Sarcoma Patients.']"""

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze root migration and its influencing factors at 6 months after coronectomy in both 2- and 3-dimensions using periapical view and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). We analyzed 33 cases of root remnant after coronectomy and measured the amount of migration in CBCT. The following factors that could possibly affect root migration were also analyzed: age, gender, number of M3 roots, shape of M3s, Pell, and Gregory classification, mesiodistal (MD) angulation, buccolingual (BL) angulation, contact point with the second molar, root curvature, and complete removal of the coronal portion. Migration of greater than 2 mm was found in 64% of the roots in the 2-dimensional (2D) analysis, and the average root migration was 4.11 mm in the 3-dimensional (3D) analysis. The factors affecting migration were the root morphology, complete removal of the coronal portion, impaction depth, and MD angulation in the 2D analysis, and MD and BL angulation in the 3D analysis. Ensuring sufficient space for root migration especially considering angulation, depth and complete removal of the coronal portion might be important factors after coronectomy of the M3. Root remnant after coronectomy of M3 may migrate in young patients who has sufficient empty coronal space and this may reduce the nerve damage by the separation of IAN and M3.""","""['Nan-Ju Lee', 'Seo-Yeon Jung', 'Kyeong-Mee Park', 'Yiseul Choi', 'Jisun Huh', 'Wonse Park']""","""[' Department of Advanced General Dentistry.', ' Department of Dental Education.', ' Department of Advanced General Dentistry, Human Identification Research Institute.', ' Department of Advanced General Dentistry, College of Dentistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 May""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Coronectomy: a surgical option for impacted third molars in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve.', 'What Are the Types and Frequencies of Complications Associated With Mandibular Third Molar Coronectomy?

A retrospective study of all children undergoing elective tympanostomy tube insertion was conducted between September 1, 2017, and May 8, 2019, to assess wait time to surgery, as well as anesthesia-related and surgical complications.  Results:   Procedural sedation in minor procedure rooms effectively decreased surgical wait times by 53 days (from 134 to 81 days, P < .001) at 16 months postimplementation. This new protocol was found to be safe and effective for healthy children, with no major surgical or anesthesia-related complications noted in 113 patients having undergone the procedure in the novel setting.  Discussion:   Although conscious sedation by emergency physicians has been well studied across a variety of surgical procedures, its novel use in pediatric tympanostomy tube insertion requires careful patient selection to enhance accessibility while maintaining anesthetic safety.  Implications for practice:   This quality improvement project describes a novel combination of processes, using a minor procedure room space and ketamine-based procedural sedation to address surgical wait times in pediatric patients undergoing tympanostomy tube insertion.""","""['Catherine F Roy', 'Sena Turkdogan', 'Lily H P Nguyen', 'Jeffrey Yeung']""","""[' Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']""","""2022""","""2022 Dec""","""Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg""","""['Tympanostomy Tube Placement in Children Using a Single-Pass Tool with Moderate Sedation.', 'Combined intranasal fentanyl and dexmedetomidine plus inhaled nitrous oxide sedation in children needing myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion with a specific handheld device.', 'Behavioral techniques to optimize success of in-office pediatric tympanostomy tube placement without sedation.', 'How do You Select an Anesthesia Method Prior to Tympanostomy Tube Insertion for a Child?', 'Tympanostomy Tube Innovation: Advances in Device Material, Design, and Office-Based Technology.']"""

The purposes of this study were to quantify the perioperative opioid prescriptions filled by patients who underwent ACLR and to identify factors associated with greater postoperative opioid use. Patients who underwent ACLR at a single institution between June 2015 and May 2017 were studied using a regional prescription monitoring database to identify all preoperative and postoperative outpatient opioid prescriptions up to 2 years postoperatively. The number of morphine milligram equivalents of each opioid was calculated to determine total morphine milligram equivalents (TMEs) filled preoperatively, at discharge, and refilled postoperatively. Patients who refilled an opioid prescription postoperatively were compared with those who did not. Ninety-nine of 269 (36.8%) total patients refilled an opioid prescription postoperatively. Thirty-three patients (12.3%) required a refill after 2 weeks postoperatively, and no patients refilled after 21 months postoperatively. Fifty-seven patients (21%) received an opioid prescription in the 2 years following surgery that was unrelated to their ACL reconstruction. Increased age, higher body mass index (BMI), government insurance, current or prior tobacco use history, preoperative opioid use, and greater number of medical comorbidities were significantly associated with refilling a prescription opioid. Higher BMI and government insurance were independent predictors of refilling. Higher preoperative TMEs and surgeon were independent predictor of greater refill TMEs. In the opioid-naïve subgroup of 177 patients, only higher BMI was a predictor of refilling, and only greater comorbidities was a predictor of greater refill TMEs. The results demonstrate that preoperative opioid use was associated with postoperative opioid refills and higher refill TMEs in a dose-dependent fashion. A higher percentage of patients received an opioid prescription for reasons unrelated to the ACL reconstruction than refilled a prescription after the first 2 weeks postoperatively.""","""['Ali Aneizi', 'Elizabeth Friedmann', 'Leah E Henry', 'Gregory Perraut', 'Patrick M J Sajak', 'Dominic J Ventimiglia', 'Cameran I Burt', 'Tina Zhang', 'Jonathan D Packer', 'R F Henn Iii']""","""[' Department of Orthopaedics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']""","""2023""","""2023 Jan""","""J Knee Surg""","""['Impact of Postoperative Opioid Use on 2-Year Patient-Reported Outcomes in Knee Surgery Patients.', 'Opioid Prescribing Trends and Geographic Variation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.', 'Opioid Demand Before and After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.', 'Has a Prescription-limiting Law in Rhode Island Helped to Reduce Opioid Use After Total Joint Arthroplasty?', 'Probability of Opioid Prescription Refilling After Surgery: Does Initial Prescription Dose Matter?']"""

This study utilized a large cadaveric collection to explore relationships between tibial slope and coronal plane deformity of the tibia. We utilized 462 well-preserved skeletons (924 tibiae), excluding any with fracture or obvious rheumatologic or infectious findings. Custom cards were made with different sized arcs on the bottom surface, so that they could rest on the anterior and posterior aspects of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus of each bone to measure PPTA. Previously measured MPTA values for the same bones were also utilized. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine relationship between MPTA and medial and lateral PPTAs. The mean age was 56 ± 10 years, with 13% female and 31% African American (remainder Caucasian). The mean MPTA was 87.2 ± 2.4 degrees. The mean medial plateau PPTA was 81.5 ± 3.8 degrees and mean lateral plateau PPTA was 81.3 ± 3.7 degrees. Regression analysis found that MPTA was significantly associated with both medial and lateral PPTAs (standardized betas 0.197 and 0.146, respectively, p < 0.0005 for both). There was a significant correlation between lateral and medial PPTAs (r = 0.435, p = 0.03).

To reduce the volume of leftover opioids and overall community opioid burden, the State of Tennessee enacted a policy to reduce initial opioid prescribing to a 3-day supply for most acute pain incidents. We aimed to evaluate the extent of leftover opioid analgesics following pediatric ambulatory surgeries in the context of a state-mandated restrictive opioid-prescribing policy. We also aimed to evaluate opioid disposal rates, methods of disposal, and reasons for nondisposal.  Methods:   Study personnel contacted the parents of 300 pediatric patients discharged with an opioid prescription following pediatric ambulatory surgery. Parents completed a retrospective telephone survey regarding opioid use and disposal. Data from the survey were combined with data from the medical record to evaluate proportion of opioid doses prescribed that were left over.  Results:   The final analyzable sample of 185 patients (62% response rate) were prescribed a median of 12 opioid doses (interquartile range [IQR], 12-18), consumed 2 opioid doses (IQR, 0-4), and had 10 opioid doses left over (IQR, 7-13). Over 90% (n = 170 of 185) of parents reported they had leftover opioid analgesics, with 83% of prescribed doses left over. A significant proportion (29%, n = 54 of 185) of parents administered no prescribed opioids after surgery. Less than half (42%, n = 71 of 170) of parents disposed of the leftover opioid medication, most commonly by flushing down the toilet, pouring down the sink, or throwing in the garbage. Parents retaining leftover opioids (53%, n = 90 of 170) were most likely to keep them in an unlocked location (68%, n = 61 of 90). Parents described forgetfulness and worry that their child will experience pain in the future as primary reasons for not disposing of the leftover opioid medication.  Conclusions:   Despite Tennessee's policy aimed at reducing leftover opioids, a significant proportion of prescribed opioids were left over following pediatric ambulatory surgeries. A majority of parents did not engage in safe opioid disposal practices. Given the safety risks related to leftover opioids in the home, further interventions to improve disposal rates and tailor opioid prescribing are warranted after pediatric surgery.""","""['Amanda L Stone', ""Dima Qu'd"", 'Twila Luckett', 'Scott D Nelson', 'Erin E Quinn', 'Amy L Potts', 'Stephen W Patrick', 'Stephen Bruehl', 'Andrew D Franklin']""","""[' From the Department of Anesthesiology.', ' Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', "" Department of Pharmacy, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee."", ' Departments of Pediatrics and Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ' Vanderbilt Center for Child Health Policy, Nashville, Tennessee.']""","""2022""","""2022 Jan""","""Anesth Analg""","""['Physicians Prescribe More Opioid Than Needed to Treat Pain in Children After Outpatient Urological Procedures: An Observational Cohort Study.', 'Opioid Use and Storage Patterns by Patients after Hospital Discharge following Surgery.', 'A Societies for Pediatric Urology survey of opioid prescribing practices after ambulatory pediatric urology procedures.', 'Opioid prescribing is excessive and variable after pediatric ambulatory urologic surgery.', 'Opioid-prescribing patterns, storage, handling, and disposal in postoperative pediatric urology patients.', 'Postoperative Pain Medication Utilization in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Sports Orthopaedic Surgery: Characterizing Patient Usage Patterns and Opioid Retention.']"""

However, there still lack the report of long-term outcomes of LS with the large-scale cases. The aim of the present study was to analyze the short- and long-term outcomes of LS in a single institution over 16 years, and to compare the perioperative outcomes of totally laparoscopic splenectomy (TLS) and hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) for splenomegaly.Between November 2002 and December 2018, 486 consecutive patients undergoing elective LS were enrolled in this study, including 222 TLS and 264 HALS. The intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed.The 5 most common indications were hypersplenism (71.0%), immune thrombocytopenia (14.8%), splenic benign tumor (4.5%), splenic cyst (2.9%), and splenic malignant tumor (2.9%). The mean operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and length of stay were 149.4 ± 63.3 minutes, 230.1 ± 225.1 mL, and 6.7 ± 3.2 days, respectively. The morbidity, mortality, reoperation, and conversion rate were 23.0%, 0, 0.4%, and 1.9%, respectively. Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) was the most frequent complication with an incidence of 19.8%. The incidence of PVST in HALS was higher than that in TLS (23.9% vs 14.9%, P = .013). Compared with TLS, HALS had a shorter operative time (P = .000), lower intraoperative blood loss (P = .000), comparable conversion rate (P = .271), and morbidity (P = .922) for splenomegaly > 17.0 cm. During the follow-up period, the overall respond rate for immune thrombocytopenia was 77.8%, and the esophagogastric variceal bleeding rate was 6.9% in 320 patients with hypersplenism secondary to hepatic cirrhosis.LS is a safe, feasible, and effective procedure with satisfactory short- and long-term outcomes.

This study aims to supply vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) (100,000 IU) to pneumonic children to minimize the duration of illness and improve their outcome.  Methods:   A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a Pediatric Cairo University affiliated hospital. An intervention arm (93 children) and a control arm (98 children), who had pneumonia with an insufficient or deficient level of vitamin D and whose parental permission was obtained, were enrolled in the trial. All children were treated with antibiotics according to WHO guidelines. Children were given a single injection of 1 mL of 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo. Clinical data were recorded every eight hours for all children. Outcomes were assessed 7 days after vitamin D injection.The primary outcome variable was the change in serum level of 25(OH)D, while the secondary outcomes were the medical state of the assigned cases (improvement or death) and duration between enrollment and hospital discharge for improved cases.  Results:   In the supplementation group, the percentage of patients who suffered either deficient (38.7%) or insufficient levels (61.3%) of 25 (OH)D at day one had significantly decreased in the seventh day to (11.8%) and (52.7%), respectively. Kaplan--Meier plots highlighted that the median time to recover of the placebo group was significantly longer than that of the supplementation group (Log Rank P value < .001).  Conclusion:   VDD was detected in pediatric critical care children.

Baseline clinical and angiographic data was obtained from our database. Patients were clinically monitored for the occurrence of any adverse events during the hospitalization. One-year follow-up was conducted by either telephone contact or outpatient visits. 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance the baseline covariates. After PSM, the clinical outcomes between the 2 groups were compared.After PSM, except more target lesion in right coronary artery existing in the RA group (P = .008), no significant statistical differences were shown in regard of the other angiographic and procedural characteristics of the 2 groups. Strategy success rates were all 100% in both groups. In the unadjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis, participants with RA had a significantly lower risk of target lesion revascularization (TLR) (hazard ratio, HR 0.275, 95% confidence intervals, CI 0.119-0.635, P = .003) and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (HR 0.488, 95% 0.277-0.859, P = .013). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, RA was significantly associated with TLR (HR 0.32, 95% 0.12-0.853, P = .023), but no longer significantly associated with MACE (HR 0.674, 95% 0.329-1.381, P = .282).In patients with HCCL, lesion preparation with RA was safe and could improve strategy success rate.

Methods:   Consecutive bronchoscopies using tomosynthesis-assisted fluoroscopic electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (F-ENB) at a single institution over a 1-year period were included. The primary outcome was diagnostic yield. A bronchoscopy was defined as diagnostic if pathologic examination revealed malignancy or specific histological findings indicative of lesional sampling with confirmatory 6-month follow-up for benign lesions.  Results:   A total of 324 patients with 363 nodules underwent F-ENB between April 25, 2018 and April 29, 2019.

Total hip arthroplasty is currently the most effective treatment for sequelae of childhood hip septic or tuberculous infection. This is a mid-term follow-up study of treatment results of patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) with cementless prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed and followed 45 patients (45 hips) who underwent THA with cementless prostheses between 2010 and 2017. There were 45 patients, including 17 men and 28 women. The average age of the patients was 46 years (range, 18-67 years). All hip infections occurred in early childhood or adolescence, and the mean interval between initial infection and THA was 38.2 years (range, 15-60 years). The mean follow-up was 6.1 years (range, 2.7-9.5 years). RESULTS Two patients underwent revision surgery because of loosening of the prosthesis, and 1 patient underwent revision surgery because of a new infection with no relationship with childhood infection during the follow-up. The average Harris hip scores significantly increased from 43.1 to 86.4 (P<0.01), and the average visual analog scale significantly increased from 4.6 to 1.7 (P<0.01). The hip dysfunction and osteoarthritis outcome scores were also significantly changed (P<0.01) at the final follow-up. There were 2 cases of transient sciatic nerve palsy and intraoperative periprosthetic fractures in 3 cases. During follow-up, single revision was performed after 6 years of primary arthroplasty because of aseptic loosening in 2 cases and prosthesis infection in 1 case, which was not related to childhood pathogens. CONCLUSIONS THA for patients with sequelae of hip joint infection has a satisfactory effect that can effectively relieve joint pain and improve hip function. The recurrence rate of infection after either pyogenic infection or tuberculous is very low. The mid-term outcomes of THA in this setting were satisfactory, with high prosthesis survivorship and hip function scores.""","""['Zhenhao Qian', 'Askar Mamtimin', 'Xiaogang Zhang', 'Boyong Xu', 'Wenbo Mu', 'Li Cao']""","""[' Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China (mainland).', ' Department of Orthopaedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China (mainland).']""","""2021""","""2021 Mar""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Low Reinfection Rates But a High Rate of Complications in THA for Infection Sequelae in Childhood: A Systematic Review.', 'Long-Term Results of Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty for Patients With High Hip Dislocation After Childhood Pyogenic Infection.', 'Mid-term results of total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis secondary to hip sepsis.', 'Outcomes of different bearings in total hip arthroplasty - implant survival, revision causes, and patient-reported outcome.', 'Extensively coated non-modular stem used in two-stage revision for infected total hip arthroplasty: mid-term to long-term follow-up.', 'Clinical outcome in total hip arthroplasty for septic sequelae in childhood : a retrospective study.']"""

Of these, 68 cases involved surgical treatment, 53 involved non-surgical treatment, and 12 cases were lost to follow-up (4 cases in the surgical group and 8 cases in the non-surgical group). Thus, 109 cases were followed-up. RE cases were divided according to different treatment methods into a radical resection group (Group A, 31 cases), a non-radical resection group (Group B, 37 cases), and a non-surgical group (Group C, 53 cases). We carried out a detailed analysis of the 109 cases experiencing surgical intervention with effective follow-up.Our analysis found that radical resection is the first line of treatment of RE, although non-radical surgery can benefit most patients. It is important to emphasize the importance of the first round of surgery, particularly in cases involving hepatic echinococcosis.

This study aimed to verify the existence of possible relationships among PA parameters and the spatio-temporal parameters of gait when both are instrumentally assessed.Thirty-one pwMS (17F, 14 M, mean age 52.5, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.1) were requested to wear a tri-axial accelerometer 24 hours/day for 7 consecutive days and underwent an instrumental gait analysis, performed using an inertial sensor located on the low back, immediately before the PA assessment period. Main spatio-temporal parameters of gait (i.e., gait speed, stride length, cadence and duration of stance, swing, and double support phase) were extracted by processing trunk accelerations. PA was quantified using average number of daily steps and percentage of time spent at different PA intensity, the latter calculated using cut-point sets previously validated for MS. The existence of possible relationships between PA and gait parameters was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho.Gait speed and stride length were the parameters with the highest number of significant correlations with PA features. In particular, they were found moderately to largely correlated with number of daily steps (rho 0.62, P< .001), percentage of sedentary activity (rho = -0.44, P < .001) and percentage of moderate-to-vigorous activity (rho = 0.48, P < .001). Small to moderate significant correlations were observed between PA intensity and duration of stance, swing and double support phases.The data obtained suggest that the most relevant determinants associated with higher and more intense levels of PA in free-living conditions are gait speed and stride length.

However, a surgical technique may be required, if the results are negative. Therefore, there is a need for new studies to increase the diagnostic value of EBUS-TBNA and provide additional information to guide the biopsy in performing the procedure. Here, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of EBUS-TBNA and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in diagnosis of hilar and/or mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). It was also aimed to determine the contributions of real-time ultrasonography (USG) images of LNs to distinguishing between the malignant and benign LNs during EBUS-TBNA, and in the diagnosis of anthracotic LNs.  Material and method:   In the retrospective study including 545 patients, 1068 LNs were sampled by EBUS-TBNA between January 2015 and February 2020. EBUS-TBNA, 18-FDG PET/CT and images of USG were investigated in the diagnosis of mediastinal and/or hilar malignant, anthracotic and other benign LNs.  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of EBUS-TBNA were found as 79.5, 98.1, 89.5, and 91.7%, respectively. Mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) values of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 6.31±4.3 in anthracotic LNs and 5.07 ± 2.53 in reactive LNs. Also, mean SUVmax of malignant LNs was 11.02 ± 7.30 and significantly higher than that of benign LNs. In differentiation of malignant-benign tumors, considering the cut off value of 18F-FDG PET/CT SUVmax as 2.72, the sensitivity and specificity was 99.3 and 11.7%, but given the cut off value as 6.48, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value was found as 76.5, 64, 20.49, and 78.38% for benign LNs, respectively. Compared LNs as to internal structure and contour features, malignant LNs had most often irregular contours and heterogeneous density. Anthracotic, reactive and other benign LNs were most frequently observed as regular contours and homogeneous density. The difference between malignant and benign LNs was significant.  Conclusion:   EBUS can contribute to the differential diagnosis of malignant, anthracotic and other benign LNs. Such contributions can guide clinician bronchoscopists during EBUS-TBNA. The triple modality of EBUS-TBNA, 18FDG PET/CT, and USG may increase the diagnostic value in hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathies.""","""['Celalettin Korkmaz', 'Soner Demirbas', 'Hulya Vatansev']""","""[' Department of Pulmonary Disease, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration can improve the diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.', 'CT differentiation of enlarged mediastinal lymph node due to anthracosis from metastatic lymphadenopathy: a comparative study proven by endobronchial US-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.', 'The critical role of EBUS-TBNA cytology in the staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in lung cancer patients: A correlation study with positron emission tomography findings.', 'The role of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the differential diagnosis of isolated mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy.', 'Impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT, CT and EBUS/TBNA on preoperative mediastinal nodal staging of NSCLC.', 'A retrospective observational study of benign anthracotic lymphadenitis and its association with PET avid lymph nodes in patients undergoing cancer evaluation.']"""

Data on patients' demographics and detailed surgical procedures were acquired from electronic medical records. The reviewed cases were categorized by the primary anatomical region requiring surgery and the primary procedure performed.A total of 1544 patients underwent surgery, and 2217 procedures were recorded during the 2-year study period. In 2016, 1062 procedures on 690 patients, and, in 2017, 1155 procedures on 787 patients were registered. The average age of the patients who underwent plastic surgical procedure due to a trauma-related cause was 38.4 years (range, 2 days to 91 years), and 1148 patients (77.7%) were male. The head and neck region was the most commonly observed anatomical area that was operated on. The facial bone requiring the largest degree of surgical intervention was the mandible, followed by the zygomatic bone, nasal bones, orbital floor, and maxilla. Microsurgical procedures, such as flap surgery and microsurgery, were performed in 121 cases. The most commonly elevated free flap was the ALT flap (n = 69).Plastic surgeons play various roles in level I trauma centers, such as in the management of facial injury, performing limb-saving free tissue transfers, and complex wound reconstruction with flaps or skin grafts. Thus, plastic surgeons are an essential part of trauma centers.""","""['Il Jae Lee', 'Bohwan Cha', 'Dong Ha Park', 'Hyung Min Hahn']""","""[' Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea.']""","""2021""","""2021 Feb""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143rd Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022.', 'The integral role of the plastic surgeon at a level I trauma center.', 'Approaches to Distal Upper-Extremity Trauma: A Comparison of Plastic, Orthopedic, and Hand Surgeons in Academic Practice.', 'Relative value unit impact of complex skin closures to academic surgical melanoma practices.', 'Evaluating the Effects of COVID-19 on Plastic Surgery Emergencies: Protocols and Analysis From a Level I Trauma Center.', 'Impact of establishing a level-1 trauma center for lower extremity trauma: a 4-year experience.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed on the data of 60 cases of thoracic tuberculosis patients treated with 1-stage posterior debridement, bone graft fusion, and pedicle screw internal fixation in the Department of Orthopedics, Zhejiang Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Integrated Hospital from March 2017 to February 2019. There were 31 males and 29 females; age: 41 to 52 years old, with an average of (46.6 ± 2.0) years old. According to whether 3D printing personalized external guide plates are used or not, they are divided into 2 groups: 30 cases in 3D printing group (observation group), and 30 cases in pedicle screw placement group (control group). A 1:1 solid model of thoracic spinal tuberculosis and personalized pedicle guide plates was created using the 3D printing technology combined with guide plates in the observation group. Stability and accuracy tests were carried out in vitro and in vivo. 30 patients in the control group used conventional nail placement with bare hands. The amount of blood loss, the number of fluoroscopy, the operation time, and the occurrence of adverse reactions related to nail placement were recorded. After the operation, the patients were scanned by computed tomography to observe the screw position and grade the screw position to evaluate the accuracy of the navigation template. All patients were followed up for more than 1 year. Visual Analogue Scale scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were evaluated before surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 12 months after surgery.  Results:   Sixty patients were followed up for 6 to 12 months after surgery. One hundred seventy-five and 177 screws were placed in the 3D printing group and the free-hand placement group, respectively. The rate of screw penetration was only 1.14% in the 3D-printed group (all 3 screws were grade 1) and 6.78% in the free-hand nail placement group (12 screws, 9 screws were grade 1 and 3 screws were grade 2).

Objective:   To create a model predicting renal function decline after minimally invasive RNU.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 490 patients with nonmetastatic UTUC who underwent minimally invasive RNU were identified from a collaborative database including 17 institutions worldwide (February 2006 to March 2020). Renal function insufficiency for cisplatin-based regimen was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <50 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 3 mo after RNU. Patients with baseline eGFR >50 ml/min/1.73 m2 (n = 361) were geographically divided into a training set (n = 226) and an independent external validation set (n = 135) for further analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Using transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines, a nomogram to predict postoperative eGFR <50 ml/min/1.73 m2 was built based on the coefficients of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) logistic regression. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical use of the nomogram were investigated.  Results and limitations:   The model that incorporated age, body mass index, preoperative eGFR, and hydroureteronephrosis was developed with an area under the curve of 0.771, which was confirmed to be 0.773 in the external validation set. The calibration curve demonstrated good agreement. Besides, the model was converted into a risk score with a cutoff value of 0.583, and the difference between the low- and high-risk groups both in overall death risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.59, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific death risk (HR: 5.19, p < 0.001) was statistically significant. The limitation mainly lies in its retrospective design.

This occurrence has been rarely reported in the literature and described only in very few case reports. During the surge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in our region, we noted an increase in the simultaneous occurrence of cardio-cerebral infarction. This led us to explore the possible mechanisms and pathophysiology that could contribute to this increase. The retrospective nature of the study limited us from drawing any conclusion about causation. Rather, we aimed to formulate a hypothesis for future, more rigorous studies.  Patient concerns:   We present an overview of 5 cases of simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction that we encountered in our emergency department within 1 month.  Diagnosis:   In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed using an electrocardiogram, assessment of laboratory cardiac markers, and imaging.  Interventions:   In all cases, dual antiplatelet therapy was started and thrombolysis was held, as the condition was considered high risk in most of the patients. Cardiac catheterization lab was not activated either because the patient was unstable or the risk of COVID-19 in staff outweighed the benefit added in patient treatment.  Outcomes:   Two out of 5 patients died because of early complications that lasted for few days. The remaining 3 were discharged from the hospital in moderate functionality for extensive therapy and rehabilitation.  Conclusion:   Early recognition and immediate treatment is important in different scenarios leading to thrombosis as the outcome. Additionally, addressing the unknown risks that could contribute to our traditional understanding of these causative mechanisms is important. The hypothesis of exacerbated damage caused by inflammatory and immunological endothelial systemic damage should further be explored to be able to delineate new possibilities in managing these conditions.""","""['Rawan Eskandarani', 'Seham Sahli', 'Shaima Sawan', 'Asim Alsaeed']""","""[' Emergency Medicine Administration, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Suicidal Ideation.', 'Complicated myocardial infarction in a 99-year-old lady in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: from the need to rule out coronavirus infection to emergency percutaneous coronary angioplasty.', 'Coronavirus Disease 2019 Complicated by Multiple Simultaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhages.', 'Post-Myocardial Infarction Complications During the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Case Series.', 'Secondary Complications in COVID-19 Patients: A Case Series.', 'Simultaneous acute cardio-cerebral infarction associated with isolated left ventricle non-compaction cardiomyopathy.', 'Late Onset Occurrence of Concomitant Myocardial Infarction and Ischemic Stroke in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report.', 'Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cardiomyocytes: Insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac injury and pharmacotherapy.', 'Successful endovascular treatment of simultaneous acute ischaemic stroke and hyperacute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the first case report of a single-operator cardio-cerebral intervention.', 'A case-based systematic review on the SARS-COVID-2-associated cerebrovascular diseases and the possible virus routes of entry.']"""

Results:   Forty-two muscular ventricular septal devices (8.4 ± 2.6 mm) were implanted in 36 subjects uneventfully. Seventeen ""complex,"" and 10 cylindrical or straight tunnel-shapedAmVSDs (including 2 re-do patients) suited perventricular and peratrial techniques respectively. Comparatively, group B exhibited shorter procedural indices than A (p < .01). Five of 15 multiple-holed AmVSDs (four Swiss cheese) required two or three devices for a satisfactory occlusion. Nevertheless, post occlusion insignificant residual shunts( ≤ 2 mm) seldom achieved spontaneous closure, and at 36-month follow-up complete closure was 67%. Residual shunt persisted amongst multiple-holed. All patients improved during follow up.

Different CO2 delivery systems during angiography are reported in literature, with automated delivery system being the latest. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and learning curve of an automated CO2 injection system with controlled pressures in peripheral arterial interventions and also to study the patients' tolerance to the system.From January 2018 to October 2019 peripheral arterial interventions were performed in 40 patients (median age-78 years, interquartile range: 69-84 years) using an automated CO2 injection system with customized protocols, with conventional iodine contrast agent used only as a bailout option. The pain and tolerance during the CO2 angiography were evaluated with a visual analog scale at the end of each procedure. The amount of CO2, iodine contrast used, and radiation dose area product for the interventions were also systematically recorded for all procedures. These values were statistically compared in 2 groups, viz first 20 patients where a learning curve was expected vs the rest 20 patients.All procedures were successfully completed without complications. All patients tolerated the CO2 angiography with a median total pain score of 3 (interquartile range: 3-4), with no statistical difference between the groups (P = .529). The 2 groups were statistically comparable in terms of comorbidities and the type of procedures performed (P = .807). The amount of iodine contrast agent used (24.60 ± 6.44 ml vs 32.70 ± 8.70 ml, P = .006) and the radiation dose area product associated were significantly lower in the second group (2160.74 ± 1181.52 μGym2 vs 1531.62 ± 536.47 μGym2, P = .043).Automated CO2 angiography is technically feasible and safe for peripheral arterial interventions and is well tolerated by the patients.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 27 rectal cancer patients who were irradiated preoperatively between January 2016 and December 2018. Five different plans (4-field 3D-CRT in 2 phases, 7-field IMRT in 2 phases, 9-field IMRT in 2 phases, 7-field simultaneous integrated boost [SIB] IMRT, and 9-field SIB IMRT) were generated for each patient. Comparison of 5 different plans according to bladder and bilateral femoral head mean doses, bladder V40, bilateral femoral head V40, and small bowel V35 values were evaluated.  Results:   Most of the OAR parameters significantly favored IMRT plans compared to the 3D-CRT plan. The largest difference was observed in bladder V40 values (reduction of V40 value up to 51.2% reduction) in favor of IMRT. In addition, SIB plans showed significantly better reduction in OARs than phase plans except for small bowel V35 values.  Conclusions:   IMRT plans reduced almost all the OARs doses compared with the 3D-CRT plan in rectal cancer patients. Furthermore, SIB plans demonstrated lower OAR doses than the phase plans. IMRT techniques, especially SIB plans, reduce OAR doses and provide safer doses for the treatment of rectal carcinoma.""","""['Bekir Hakan Bakkal', 'Ozlem Elmas']""","""[' Department of Radiation Oncology, Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit University Faculty of Medicine, Zonguldak, Turkey.']""","""2021""","""2021 Jan""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Dosimetric comparative study of 3 different postoperative radiotherapy techniques (3D-CRT, IMRT, and RapidArc) for II-III stage rectal cancer.', 'Compared planning dosimetry of TOMO, VMAT and IMRT in rectal cancer with different simulated positions.', 'A dosimetric evaluation of dose escalation for the radical treatment of locally advanced vulvar cancer by intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric benefits of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy in the treatment of postoperative cervical cancer patients.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy with simultaneous integrated boost for locally advanced rectal cancer.', 'The in-silico feasibility of dose escalated, hypofractionated radiotherapy for rectal cancer.']"""

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of HHLA2 in cervical adenocarcinoma (AC) and the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological factors to assess its use as a potential marker for AC prognosis.This study included 76 patients diagnosed with cervical AC. Their resected specimens were obtained and a tissue microarray was constructed. Expression of HHLA2 was detected by the immunohistochemistry. Based on the follow-up data, correlation of HHLA2 expression and clinicopathological features, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival, was evaluated. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the expression of HHLA2 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).A total of 76 cases of invasive cervical AC were evaluated. High HHLA2 expression was detected in 62 cases (81.6%) and low HHLA2 expression was presented in 14 cases (18.4%). HHLA2 expression showed a significant negative correlation with lymph node metastasis (P = .011). Disease free survival was 75.0% and 49.0% in high-expression and the low expression group, respectively (P = .057). Although there was no statistical significance, an improved OS was observed in the high expression group (83.1% vs 64.9%, P = .479). Further, the expression of HHLA2 and PD-L1 correlated positively (P = .005). Thus, an improved OS was observed in the PD-L1 expression group (90.7% vs 66.2%, P = .037).High expression of HHLA2 is related to tumor progression and prognosis in patients with cervical AC.

However, it is unclear how the type or duration of individual respiratory events modulate ultra-short-term HRV and beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals). We aimed to examine the sex-specific changes in RR interval and ultra-short-term HRV during and after apneas and hypopneas of various durations. Electrocardiography signals, recorded as a part of clinical polysomnography, of 758 patients (396 men) with suspected OSA were analysed retrospectively. Average RR intervals and time-domain HRV parameters were determined during the respiratory event and the 15-s period immediately after the event. Parameters were analysed in three pooled sex-specific subgroups based on the respiratory event duration (10-20 s, 20-30 s, and > 30 s) separately for apneas and hypopneas. We observed that RR intervals shortened after the respiratory events and the magnitude of these changes increased in both sexes as the respiratory event duration increased. Furthermore, ultra-short-term HRV generally increased as the respiratory event duration increased. Apneas caused higher ultra-short-term HRV and a stronger decrease in RR interval compared to hypopneas. In conclusion, the respiratory event type and duration modulate ultra-short-term HRV and RR intervals. Considering HRV and the respiratory event characteristics in the diagnosis of OSA could be useful when assessing the cardiac consequences of OSA in a more detailed manner.""","""['Salla Hietakoste', 'Henri Korkalainen', 'Samu Kainulainen', 'Saara Sillanmäki', 'Sami Nikkonen', 'Sami Myllymaa', 'Brett Duce', 'Juha Töyräs', 'Timo Leppänen']""","""[' Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. salla.hietakoste@uef.fi.', ' Diagnostic Imaging Center, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. salla.hietakoste@uef.fi.', ' Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', ' Diagnostic Imaging Center, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', ' Sleep Disorders Centre, Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.', ' Institute for Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.', ' School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']""","""2020""","""2020 Dec""","""Sci Rep""","""['Differences in arousal probability and duration after apnea and hypopnea events in adult obstructive sleep apnea patients.', 'The effect of sildenafil on sleep respiratory parameters and heart rate variability in obstructive sleep apnea.', 'Cardiac sympathetic modulation in response to apneas/hypopneas through heart rate variability analysis.', 'Duration of respiratory events in obstructive sleep apnea: Factors influencing the duration of respiratory events.', 'Duration of respiratory events in obstructive sleep apnea: In search of paradoxical results.', 'Coupling analysis of heart rate variability and cortical arousal using a deep learning algorithm.', 'Driver Stress Detection Using Ultra-Short-Term HRV Analysis under Real World Driving Conditions.', 'Obstructive sleep apnoea-related respiratory events and desaturation severity are associated with the cardiac response.', 'Diagnostic Efficacy of Ultra-Short Term HRV Analysis in Obstructive Sleep Apnea.', 'Effects of hyperventilation length on muscle sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans simulating periodic breathing.']"""

The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the prediction performance improvement for sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer from peritumoral features in radiomic analysis by exploring the effect of peritumoral region sizes.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study was performed using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans of 162 breast cancer patients. The effect of peritumoral features was evaluated in a radiomics pipeline for predicting SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Peritumoral regions were generated by dilating the tumor regions-of-interest (ROIs) manually annotated by two expert radiologists, with thicknesses of 2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm. The prediction models were established in the training set (∼67% of cases) using the radiomics pipeline with and without peritumoral features derived from different peritumoral thicknesses. The prediction performance was tested in an independent validation set (the remaining ∼33%).  Results:   For this specific application, the accuracy in the validation set when using the two radiologists' ROIs could be both improved from 0.704 to 0.796 by incorporating peritumoral features. The choice of the peritumoral size could affect the level of improvement.  Conclusion:   This study systematically investigates the effect of peritumoral region sizes in radiomic analysis for prediction performance improvement. The choice of the peritumoral size is dependent on the ROI drawing and would affect the final prediction performance of radiomic models, suggesting that peritumoral features should be optimized in future radiomics studies.""","""['Jie Ding', 'Shenglan Chen', 'Mario Serrano Sosa', 'Renee Cattell', 'Lan Lei', 'Junqi Sun', 'Prateek Prasanna', 'Chunling Liu', 'Chuan Huang']""","""[' Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA; Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 W Watertown Plank Rd, Wauwatosa, WI 53226, USA.', ' Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', ' Pogram in Program in Public Health, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', "" Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA; Department of Radiology, Yuebei People's Hospital, 133 Huimin S Rd, Shaoguan, Guangdong 512025, China."", ' Department of Biomedical Informatics, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.', ' Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA; Department of Radiology, Guangdong General Hospital/Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, 106 Zhongshan 2nd Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', ' Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA; Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, 101 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.

There was a significant difference in the median volume (p = 0.008), median longest axial tumor diameter (p = 0.009), and median longest volumetric diameter (p = 0.01) among tumor subtypes. There was also a significant difference in minimum signal intensity and entropy among the tumor subtypes with SSF = 4 mm (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02 respectively) and SSF = 6 mm (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001 respectively). Additionally, sphericity (p = 0.04) in HER2+ tumors and entropy with SSF = 2, 4, 6 mm (p = 0.004, 0.02, 0.047 respectively) in luminal tumors were significantly associated with pCR. Multiple features demonstrated significant association (p < 0.05) with pCR in TNBC and with RCB in luminal tumors and TNBC, with standard deviation of intensity with SSF = 6 mm achieving the highest AUC (AUC = 0.734) for pCR in TNBC.  Conclusion:   MRI radiomics features are associated with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, pCR, and RCB.

However, no quantitative evaluation has been established to assess the applicability of simple anastomosis preoperatively. We conducted this retrospective study to establish a reference range of maximal CT attenuation values for application of simple anastomosis.  Methods:   A total of 122 consecutive patients underwent replacement of the thoracic aorta between 2007 and 2011, excluding those with acute aortic dissection. The patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent simple anastomosis (simple group: n = 105), and those who required endarterectomy before anastomosis (manipulation group: n = 17). The maximal CT attenuation values at the anastomosis site were calculated by imaging software.  Results:   The mean maximal CT attenuation values (Hounsfield unit [HU]) was significantly higher in the manipulation group (638.1 ± 269.5 [166-1304]) than in the simple group (94.7 ± 171.5 [0-790]; p < .0001). The maximal CT attenuation values enabled us to predict the simple anastomosis with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (p < .0001). The cut-off value was 325 HU (sensitivity 94.1%, specificity 81.7%). The 10-year survival rate was significantly lower in the manipulation group (11.8%) than in the simple group (43.2%). In the multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.073), hypertension (HR: 2.382), and maximal CT attenuation values (HR: 1.001) were independently associated with long-term mortality.

Median latency between bariatric surgery and LBCS was 31 months. The patients with LBCS were younger (p < 0.001) and received sleeve gastrectomy (p < 0.001). We revealed an annual correlation between LBCS and bariatric procedures (r = 0.683). With a two-year latency between the bariatric and post-bariatric operations, the correlation co-efficiency was strong (r = 0.927). LBCS operations ranged from 5 to 215 per hospital district.

A weekly schedule is recommended, but there is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimal dose. We evaluated the efficacy of two different doses of weekly nab-paclitaxel, with a specific focus on their corresponding impact on patient function, in order to address the lack of data specifically relating to the older population.  Methods:   EFFECT is an open-label, phase II trial wherein 160 women with advanced breast cancer aged ≥ 65 years were enrolled from 15 institutions within Italy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (arm A) or 125 mg/m2 (arm B) on days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28-day cycle, as first-line treatment for advanced disease. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), wherein an event was defined as disease progression (PD), functional decline (FD), or death. In each arm, the null hypothesis that the median EFS would be ≤ 7 months was tested against a one-sided alternative according to the Brookmeyer Crowley test. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 32.6 months, 140 events were observed in 158 evaluable patients. Median EFS was 8.2 months (90% CI, 5.9-8.9; p = 0.188) in arm A vs 8.3 months (90% CI, 6.2-9.7, p = 0.078) in arm B. Progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rates were similar in both groups. A higher percentage of dose reductions and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) was noted in arm B. The most frequently reported non-haematological AEs were fatigue (grade [G] 2-3 toxicity occurrence in arm A vs B, 43% and 51%, respectively) and peripheral neuropathy (G2-3 arm A vs B, 19% and 38%, respectively).  Conclusion:   Pre-specified outcomes were similar in both treatment arms. However, 100 mg/m2 was significantly better tolerated with fewer neurotoxicity-related events, representing a more feasible dose to be recommended for older patients with advanced disease.

Variability in exacerbation diagnoses and treatment have led drug developers to employ ""objective"" exacerbation definitions combining antimicrobial treatment (AT) and the presence of ≥4 of 12 respiratory criteria (first published by Fuchs et al. [NEJM 1994;331(10):637-42]). Assumptions underlying this approach have yet to be formally evaluated.  Methods:   Respiratory events (RE) observed during a 48-week trial of ataluren (NCT02139306), a read-through agent for premature nonsense codons, were compared across six exacerbation definitions: any AT, intravenous AT (IVAT), ≥4 Fuchs criteria present, AT plus ≥4 Fuchs criteria, IVAT plus ≥4 Fuchs criteria, and investigator assessment. Fuchs definitions were evaluated by assessing missingness of individual criteria and associations between criteria presence and clinician exacerbation assessment.  Results:   Among 751 RE, more than one third had ≥4 Fuchs criteria present but were not assessed as exacerbations by investigators. Data for ≥1 and for 4 Fuchs criteria, respectively, were missing for ~ 90% and >30% of RE. Only 6/12 Fuchs criteria were present more often when investigators assessed RE as exacerbations than when they did not.  Conclusions:   ""Objective"" definitions have shortcomings inconsistent with their purpose of optimizing exacerbation capture in clinical trials : 1) they capture events clinicians do not consider exacerbations, 2) are prone to data missingness which can bias the likelihood of meeting the definition, and 3) employ criteria that are not associated with investigator assessment of exacerbation.""","""['Donald R VanDevanter', 'Nicole Mayer Hamblett', 'Noah Simon', 'Joseph McIntosh', 'Michael W Konstan']""","""[' Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.

This study examined our long-term outcomes following the Cox-Maze IV procedure (CMP-IV).  Methods:   Between May 2003 and March 2018, 853 patients underwent either biatrial CMP-IV (n = 765) or a left-sided CMP-IV (n = 88) lesion set with complete isolation of the posterior left atrium. Freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATA) was assessed for up to 10 years. Rhythm outcomes were compared in multiple subgroups. Predictors of recurrence were determined using Fine-Gray regression, allowing for death as the competing risk.  Results:   The majority of patients (513/853, 60%) had nonparoxysmal AF. Twenty-four percent of patients (201/853) had not responded to at least 1 catheter-based ablation. Prolonged monitoring was used in 76% (647/853) of patients during their follow-up. Freedom from ATA was 92% (552/598), 84% (213/253), and 77% (67/87) at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. By competing risk analysis, incidence of first ATA recurrence was 11%, 23%, and 35% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. On Fine-Gray regression, age, peripheral vascular disease, nonparoxysmal AF, left atrial size, early postoperative ATAs, and absence of sinus rhythm at discharge were the predictors of first ATA recurrence over 10 years of follow-up.  Conclusions:   The CMP-IV had an excellent long-term efficacy at maintaining sinus rhythm. At late follow-up, the results of the CMP-IV remained superior to those reported for catheter ablation and other forms of surgical ablation for AF.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective single-center study identified patients with preoperative cardiac computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgically confirmed LVAs or LV PSAs over a 10-year period. Seventeen LV PSAs (11 MRI, 6 CT) and 18 LVAs (10 MRI, 8 CT) were included. The myocardial cut-off sign was objectively a >50% decrease in aneurysm sac wall thickness measured at 1 cm from the aneurysmal neck (measurements at 2 cm were also assessed) and subjectively an abrupt ""cut-off"" of myocardium for the aneurysm sac for PSA compared with a gradual tapering of sac wall thickness for LVA. Two radiologists independently evaluated images for the subjective presence of this sign.  Results:   The myocardial cut-off sign was 91% sensitive and 97% specific when measured 1 cm from the aneurysm neck. When measured at 2 cm from the neck, the sign was 100% sensitive and 69% specific. Subjective analysis of whether the myocardium appeared ""cut-off"" was 94% to 100% sensitive and 78% to 94% specific with excellent agreement for both PSA (κ=0.94) and LVA (κ=0.83).

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with the 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19). Fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: including lopinavir/ritonavir group (34 cases) and arbidol group (16 cases). Lopinavir/ritonavir group received 400 mg/100mg of Lopinavir/ritonavir, twice a day for a week, while the arbidol group was given 0.2 g arbidol, three times a day. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid genes by RT-PCR assay were monitored during antiviral therapy. None of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. There was no difference in fever duration between the two groups (P=0.61). On day 14 after the admission, no viral load was detected in arbidol group, but the viral load was found in 15(44.1%) patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test compared to those in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (P<0.01). Moreover, no apparent side effects were found in both groups.

With recent improvements in implant design, indications for TWA have broadened. However, despite these improvements, there are still complications associated with TWA, such as unplanned reoperation and eventual implant removal. The goal of this study was to identify risk factors for an unplanned reoperation or implant revision after a TWA at 2 academic medical centers between 2002 and 2015. Methods: In this retrospective study, 24 consecutive TWAs were identified using CPT codes. Medical records were manually reviewed to identify demographic, patient- or disease-related, and surgery-related risk factors for reoperation and implant removal after a primary TWA. Results: Forty-six percent of wrists (11 of 24 TWAs performed) had a reoperation after a median of 3.4 years, while 29% (7 of 24) underwent implant revision after a median of 5 years. Two patients had wrist surgery prior to their TWA, both eventually had their implant removed (P = .08). There were no risk factors associated with reoperation or implant removal. Conclusion: Unplanned reoperation and implant removal after a primary TWA are common. Approximately 1 in 3 wrists are likely to undergo revision surgery.

Purpose:   To assess the diagnostic performance of mpMRI including qualitative and quantitative assessment of MRE, liver surface nodularity (LSN) measurement, hepatic enhancement ratios postgadoxetic acid, and serum markers (APRI, FIB-4) for the detection of liver fibrosis.  Study type:   IRB-approved retrospective.  Subjects:   Eighty-three adult patients.  Field strength/sequence:   1.5T and 3.0T MR systems. MRE and T1 -weighted postgadoxetic acid sequences.  Assessment:   Two independent observers analyzed qualitative color-coded MRE maps on a scale of 0-3. Regions of interest were drawn to measure liver stiffness on MRE stiffness maps and on pre- and postcontrast T1 -weighted images to measure hepatic enhancement ratios. Software was used to generate LSN measurements. Histopathology was used as the reference standard for diagnosis of liver fibrosis in all patients.  Statistical tests:   A multivariable logistic analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of liver fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated the performance of each imaging technique for detection of fibrosis, in comparison with serum markers.  Results:   Liver stiffness measured with MRE provided the strongest correlation with histopathologic fibrosis stage (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), and the highest diagnostic performance for detection of stages F2-F4, F3-F4, and F4 (areas under the curve [AUCs] of 0.87, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively, P < 0.001) compared to other methods. Qualitative assessment of MRE maps showed fair to good accuracy for detection of fibrosis (AUC range 0.76-0.84).

However, patients often require time-intensive post-operative management to balance their coupled stimulation and medication treatments. Given the large and complex parameter space associated with this task, we propose that clinical decision support systems (CDSS) based on machine learning algorithms could assist in treatment optimization.  Objective:   Develop a proof-of-concept implementation of a CDSS that incorporates patient-specific details on both stimulation and medication.  Methods:   Clinical data from 10 patients, and 89 post-DBS surgery visits, were used to create a prototype CDSS. The system was designed to provide three key functions: (1) information retrieval; (2) visualization of treatment, and; (3) recommendation on expected effective stimulation and drug dosages, based on three machine learning methods that included support vector machines, Naïve Bayes, and random forest.  Results:   Measures of medication dosages, time factors, and symptom-specific pre-operative response to levodopa were significantly correlated with post-operative outcomes (P < 0.05) and their effect on outcomes was of similar magnitude to that of DBS. Using those results, the combined machine learning algorithms were able to accurately predict 86% (12/14) of the motor improvement scores at one year after surgery.

Thirty-nine patients suffering from advanced Parkinson disease (PD) were operated on. Motor function and reaction time (RT) performance [simple RT (SRT) and complex RT (CRT)] were evaluated under four experimental conditions with stimulation (stim) and medication (med) on and off: stim-on/med-on, stim-on/med-off, stim-off/med-off and stim-off/med-on. In the last condition, the patients received either low medication (usual dose) or high medication (suprathreshold dose). STN stimulation improved the motor performance in the SRT and CRT tasks. Furthermore, STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) also improved response preparation as shown by the significant improvement of the RT performance in the SRT task. This effect of STN DBS on the RT performance in the SRT task was greater as compared with the CRT task. This is due to the more complex information processing that is required in the CRT task as compared to the SRT task. These data suggest that treatment of STN hyperactivity by DBS improves motor function, confirming earlier reports, but has a differential effect on cognitive functions. The STN seems to be an important modulator of cognitive processing and STN DBS can differentially affect motor and associative circuits.""","""['Yasin Temel', 'Arjan Blokland', 'Linda Ackermans', 'Peter Boon', 'Vivianne H J M van Kranen-Mastenbroek', 'E A M Beuls', 'Geert H Spincemaille', 'Veerle Visser-Vandewalle']""","""[' Departments of Neurosurgery and Cellular Neuroscience, European Graduate School of Neuroscience (EURON), University Hospital Maastricht, Po Box 5800, 6202, AZ, Maastricht, The Netherlands. y.temel@np.unimaas.nl']""","""2006""","""2006 Mar""","""Exp Brain Res""","""[""Differential effects of levodopa and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease."", ""Influence of subthalamic deep brain stimulation versus levodopa on motor perseverations in Parkinson's disease."", ""Acute psychotropic effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation and levodopa in Parkinson's disease."", 'Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus enhances emotional processing in Parkinson disease.', 'Effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation on motor cortex plasticity in Parkinson disease.', ""Cognitive Impact of Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease Patients: A Systematic Review."", ""Program of Seven 45-min Dry Immersion Sessions Improves Choice Reaction Time in Parkinson's Disease."", 'Lead-Induced Atypical Parkinsonism in Rats: Behavioral, Electrophysiological, and Neurochemical Evidence for a Role of Noradrenaline Depletion.', ""Systems approaches to optimizing deep brain stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease."", 'Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation: Basic Concepts and Novel Perspectives.']"""

Early and midterm results""","""Aims:   This retrospective study evaluates early and midterm results in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.  Technique:   Ninety-seven consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and ejection fraction of left ventricle (LVEF) less or equal to 25 % underwent elective coronary artery bypass graft procedure between September 1998 and December 2001. Mean age at operation was 66 (47-86) years. The main symptoms were angina class III-IV Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) in 78 patients (80 %) and dyspnoea class III-IV New York Heart Association (NYHA) in 43 patients (44 %). The major indications for surgery were severe angina, dyspnoea in 90 patients (93 %). Cardiac index (CI), echocardiography (ECHO), planimetry, end-diastolic pressure of left ventricle (LVEDP), end-diastolic diameter of left ventricle (LVEDd) were used to access left ventricular function preoperatively. ECHO was also used to access left ventricular function postoperatively.  Results:   Early postoperative (30 days) mortality was 4.1 %. Complications had 25 patients (26 %) postoperatively. Two years survival was 95.7 %. Class III-IV CCS and/or NYHA had 17 patients (17.5 %) two years after surgery. LVEF (assessed by ECHO) improved from 23.1 % preoperatively to 36.0 % postoperatively (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The study showed that elective myocardial revascularisation in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and signs of myocardial viability is not necessarily associated with high operative mortality. It can be performed safely with respectable midterm survival in concordance with left ventricular function improvement, symptom relief and quality of life improvement.""","""['Jirí Skorpil', 'Radim Brát', 'Bohumil Docekal', 'Oldrich Motyka']""","""[' Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Ostrava, Czech Republic. jiri.skorpil@seznam.cz']""","""2004""","""2004 Jul""","""Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub""","""['Does on-pump/beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting offer better outcome in end-stage coronary artery disease patients?', 'Myocardial revascularization in patients with severe ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.

Methods:   The usg-FNAC results of 245 patients with thyroid nodules, who afterwards underwent thyroid surgery or who died, and autopsies were carried out, and compared retrospectively with cytologic results. Patients with malignant cytologic conclusion without histological confirmation after surgery or autopsy were excluded from the study (9 persons). The usg-FNAC results were divided as follows: group 1: diagnosis of malignancy (n = 30), group 2: suspicion of malignancy (n = 28), group 3: benign (n = 126), group 4: inconclusive (n = 29).  Results:   Assuming the cytologic results of group 1 and group 2 were interpreted as being malignant and those of group 3 as being benign, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of usg-FNAC were 90 %, 85 % and 86 % respectively. Comparing the cytologic conclusions between a group of patients with follicular lesions and a subgroup of other lesions a statistically significant difference (p < 0,01) between both subgroups using Fisher's test was found. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in subgroup of follicular lesions were low (71 %, 63 %, 67 %), while in the subgroup of other lesions were high (94 %, 86 %, 88 %). FNAC can specify the nature of focal lesion with high sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy in the cases of non-follicular lesions. Histological evaluation is required to specification of the nature in cases in which cytology is indicative of follicular proliferation.""","""['A Martínek', 'J Dvorácková', 'M Honka', 'J Horácek', 'P Klvana']""","""[' Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic.']""","""2004""","""2004 Jul""","""Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub""","""['Features and diagnostic accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules: retrospective study from Oman.', 'Initially non-diagnostic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules: value and management.', 'Fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules: a cytopathologic study of 2 043 cases.', 'Comparison of thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy results before and after implementation of Bethesda classification.', 'New perspectives in the diagnosis of thyroid follicular lesions.', 'Fine needle aspiration: an atraumatic method to diagnose head and neck masses.']"""
